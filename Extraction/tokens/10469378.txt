Abstract
Text
Metabolic
bone
disease
might
commence
early
in
the
course
of
renal
failure
This
study
therefore
examined
the
frequency
and
severity
of
the
skeletal
changes
in
predialysis
chronic
renal
failure
by
measurements
of
bone
mineral
density
(BMD)
biochemical
markers
of
bone
turnover
(osteocalcin
bone-specific
alkaline
phosphatase
carboxy
terminal
propeptide
of
type
I
collagen
and
carboxy-terminal
telopeptide
of
type
I
collagen)
parathyroid
hormone
(PTH)
ionized
calcium
(Ca++)
phosphate
(P)
and
vitamin
D
metabolites
The
study
was
performed
in
113
patients
(male/female
82/31)
with
chronic
renal
diseases
[mean
glomerular
filtration
rate
(GFR)
of
37
ml/min]
and
in
89
matched
normal
control
subjects
The
patients
had
significantly
(P<005)
reduced
BMD
in
the
spine
(-63%)
the
femur
(-121%)
the
forearm
(-57%)
and
the
total
body
(-42%)
as
compared
with
the
control
subjects
Dividing
the
patients
into
quartiles
according
to
GFR
revealed
that
BMD
decreased
with
the
gradual
decline
in
renal
function
at
all
the
measured
skeletal
sites
but
was
most
pronounced
in
the
femur
063+/-003
074+/-002
077+/-002
and
082+/-003
g/cm2
in
each
quartile
from
lowest
to
highest
GFR
compared
with
082+/-002
g/cm2
in
the
control
group
(P<00001)
All
of
the
measured
bone
markers
showed
increasing
plasma
levels
with
the
more
advanced
stages
of
renal
failure
Serum
PTH
and
serum
P
levels
increased
whereas
serum
Ca++
and
125-dihydroxyvitamin
D
decreased
BMD
Z-scores
of
the
femur
and
of
the
forearm
correlated
to
the
biochemical
markers
and
to
PTH
(P<005
to
P<00001)
The
biochemical
markers
all
showed
strong
correlations
to
PTH
also
when
corrected
for
the
effect
of
the
decline
in
GFR
(r
=
040
to
092
P<001
to
P<
00001)
Skeletal
changes
are
initiated
at
an
early
stage
of
chronic
renal
failure
as
estimated
from
reduced
BMD
and
elevated
levels
of
PTH
and
from
the
biochemical
markers
of
both
bone
formation
and
bone
resorption
