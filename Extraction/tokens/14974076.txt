Title
Complex
behavioural
and
educational
interventions
for
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
Abstract
Text
Nocturnal
enuresis
(bedwetting)
is
a
socially
disruptive
and
stressful
condition
which
affects
around
15-20%
of
five
year
olds
and
up
to
2%
of
young
adults
To
assess
the
effects
of
complex
behavioural
and
educational
interventions
on
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
and
to
compare
them
with
other
interventions
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Incontinence
Group
trials
register
(December
2002)
and
the
reference
lists
of
relevant
articles

All
randomised
or
quasi-randomised
trials
of
complex
behavioural
or
educational
interventions
for
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
were
included
except
those
focused
solely
on
daytime
wetting
Comparison
interventions
included
no
treatment
simple
and
physical
behavioural
methods
alarms
desmopressin
tricyclics
and
miscellaneous
other
interventions
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
the
quality
of
the
eligible
trials
and
extracted
data
Sixteen
trials
involving
1081
children
were
identified
which
included
a
complex
or
educational
intervention
for
nocturnal
enuresis
The
trials
were
mostly
small
and
some
had
methodological
problems
including
the
use
of
a
quasi-randomised
method
of
concealment
of
allocation
in
three
trials
and
baseline
differences
between
the
groups
in
another
threeA
complex
intervention
(such
as
dry
bed
training
(DBT)
or
full
spectrum
home
training
(FSHT))
including
an
alarm
was
better
than
no-treatment
control
groups
(eg
RR
for
failure
or
relapse
after
stopping
DBT

95%

to

but
there
was
not
enough
evidence
about
the
effects
of
complex
interventions
alone
if
an
alarm
was
not
used
A
complex
intervention
on
its
own
was
not
as
good
as
an
alarm
on
its
own
or
the
intervention
supplemented
by
an
alarm
(eg
RR
for
failure
or
relapse
after
DBT
alone
versus
DBT
plus
alarm

180
to
438)
On
the
other
hand
a
complex
intervention
supplemented
by
a
bed
alarm
might
reduce
the
relapse
rate
compared
with
the
alarm
on
its
own
(eg
RR
for
failure
or
relapse
after
DBT
plus
alarm
versus
alarm
alone
05
95%
CI
031
to
080)There
was
not
enough
evidence
to
judge
whether
providing
educational
information
about
enuresis
was
effective
irrespective
of
method
of
delivery
There
was
some
evidence
that
direct
contact
between
families
and
therapists
enhanced
the
effect
of
a
complex
intervention
and
that
increased
contact
and
support
enhanced
a
package
of
simple
behavioural
interventions
but
these
were
addressed
only
in
single
trials
and
the
results
would
need
to
be
confirmed
by
further
randomised
controlled
trials
in
particular
the
effect
on
use
of
resources
Although
DBT
and
FSHT
were
better
than
no
treatment
when
used
in
combination
with
an
alarm
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
their
use
without
an
alarm
An
alarm
on
its
own
was
also
better
than
DBT
on
its
own
but
there
was
some
evidence
that
combining
an
alarm
with
DBT
was
better
than
an
alarm
on
its
own
suggesting
that
DBT
may
augment
the
effect
of
an
alarm
There
was
also
some
evidence
that
direct
contact
with
a
therapist
might
enhance
the
effects
of
an
intervention
