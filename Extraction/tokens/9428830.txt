Abstract
Text
To
describe
a
preliminary
investigation
of
a
model
of
naltrexone
therapy
and
counselling
for
use
by
primary
care
providers
and
evaluate
its
impact
on
drinking
behaviors
in
a
cohort
of
alcohol-dependent
subjects
The
subjects
enrolled
in
this
study
were
29
alcohol-dependent
individuals
They
were
managed
within
a
primary
care
treatment
model
located
at
a
university-affiliated
substance
research
program
in
New
Haven
Connecticut
Subjects
were
assigned
to
a
primary
care
provider
for
treatment
of
their
alcohol
dependence
and
were
placed
on
naltrexone
at
a
dose
of
50
mg
per
day
They
were
seen
for
an
initial
"new
patient"
visit
and
7
"brief"
follow-up
visits
during
the
10-week
study
The
primary
outcomes
for
this
study
were
completion
of
treatment
change
in
drinking
behaviors
from
baseline
change
in
liver
enzymes
from
baseline
provider
ratings
of
improvement
and
patient
ratings
of
improvement
and
satisfaction
with
treatment
Of
the
29
subjects
21
(72%)
completed
treatment
and
10
(35%)
relapsed
to
heavy
drinking
All
drinking
behaviors
improved
significantly
from
baseline
percent
of
days
abstinent
increased
from
366%
to
888%
(P
<
00001)
percent
days
abstinent
from
heavy
drinking
increased
from
487%
to
973%
(P
<
00001)
and
mean
number
of
drinks
per
occasion
decreased
from
95
to
25
(P
<
00001)
The
mean
serum
gamma
glutamyl
transferase
(GGT)
for
the
group
decreased
from
671
U/L
to
453
U/L
(P
<
00001)
In
this
preliminary
investigation
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
with
our
model
of
naltrexone
and
counselling
by
primary
care
providers
appeared
to
be
both
feasible
and
effective
