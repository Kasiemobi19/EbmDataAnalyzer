Title
Effect
of
the
insulin
sensitizer
pioglitazone
on
insulin
resistance
hyperandrogenism
and
ovulatory
dysfunction
in
women
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
Abstract
Text
Polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS)
is
characterized
by
hyperandrogenism
chronic
anovulation
and
insulin
resistance
long-term
consequences
include
diabetes
mellitus
type
2
The
aim
of
this
randomized
double-blind
controlled
trial
was
to
investigate
whether
the
thiazolidinedione
derivative
pioglitazone
diminishes
insulin
resistance
and
hyperandrogenism
and
enhances
ovulation
rates
in
women
with
PCOS
Forty
premenopausal
women
with
PCOS
were
randomly
allocated
to
treatment
with
either
pioglitazone
(30
mg/d)
or
placebo
for
periods
of
3
months
Administration
of
pioglitazone
resulted
in
a
remarkable
decline
in
both
fasting
serum
insulin
levels
(P
<
002)
and
the
area
under
the
insulin
response
curve
after
an
oral
glucose
load
(P
<
002)
This
represented
an
increase
in
insulin
sensitivity
and
a
decrease
in
insulin
secretion
(P
<
005)
Furthermore
pioglitazone
increased
serum
SHBG
(P
<
005)
resulting
in
a
significant
decrease
in
the
free
androgen
index
(P
<
005
compared
with
placebo)
Treatment
with
pioglitazone
was
also
associated
with
higher
ovulation
rates
(P
<
002)
Thus
pioglitazone
significantly
improved
insulin
sensitivity
hyperandrogenism
and
ovulation
rates
in
women
with
PCOS
thereby
providing
both
metabolic
and
reproductive
benefits
