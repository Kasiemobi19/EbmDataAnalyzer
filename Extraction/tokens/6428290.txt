L-Thyroxine
therapy
in
subclinical
hypothyroidism
A
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
The
indications
for
treating
patients
with
subclinical
hypothyroidism
(normal
serum
thyroxine
and
free
thyroxine
levels
but
elevated
serum
thyrotrophin
levels)
are
poorly
defined
In
this
study
33
patients
with
subclinical
hypothyroidism
were
randomly
assigned
in
a
double-blind
manner
to
receive
placebo
or
L-thyroxine
therapy
and
were
followed
for
1
year
with
thyroid
function
tests
serum
lipid
measurements
basal
metabolic
rate
and
systolic
time
interval
determinations
and
a
questionnaire
on
hypothyroid
symptoms
The
placebo
group
showed
no
changes
in
thyroid
function
or
peripheral
indices
of
thyroid
hormone
action
In
the
thyroxine-treated
group
serum
lipids
and
the
mean
systolic
time
interval
did
not
change
but
the
systolic
time
intervals
became
normal
in
the
5
patients
with
the
most
abnormal
baseline
values
Symptoms
improved
in
8
of
14
patients
receiving
thyroxine
and
in
3
of
12
patients
receiving
placebo
(p
less
than
005)
L-Thyroxine
therapy
may
be
useful
for
patients
with
subclinical
hypothyroidism
with
abnormal
myocardial
contractility
or
symptoms
consistent
with
mild
hypothyroidism
or
both
