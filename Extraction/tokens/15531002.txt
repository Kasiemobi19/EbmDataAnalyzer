Association
between
congestive
heart
failure
and
hospitalization
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes

receiving

with
insulin
or
pioglitazone
a
retrospective
data
analysis
Abstract
Text
Thiazolidinediones
(TZDs)
are
widely
used
oral
antihyperglycemic
drugs
that
facilitate
insulin
action
and
increase
insulin-stimulated
glucose
metabolism
thereby
decreasing
insulin
resistance
However
concerns
have
been
raised
regarding
the
association
between
TZD
use
and
a
heightened
risk
for
congestive
heart
failure
(CHF)
This
study
used
claims
data
to
conduct
a
retrospective
examination
of
the
CHF
risk
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
and
to
compare
the
association
with
CHF
in
those
receiving
the
TZD
pioglitazone
and
those
receiving
insulin
Patients
with
type
2
diabetes
aged
>
or
=18
years
who
had
begun
treatment
with
pioglitazone
or
insulin
between
January
1999
and
December
2001
were
identified
using
the
PharMetrics
Patient-Centric
database
The
sample
was
restricted
to
patients
for
whom
there
were
>
or
=12
months
of
data
before
the
index
date
(date
of
the
first
prescription
for
pioglitazone
or
insulin)
and
>
or
=3
months
of
follow-up
data
Patients
receiving
a
diagnosis
of
CHF
before
the
index
date
were
excluded
The
propensity
score
for
receiving
pioglitazone
was
estimated
using
logistic
regression
based
on
available
observed
patient
characteristics
Patients
receiving
insulin
were
matched
in
a
11
ratio
with
patients
receiving
pioglitazone
based
on
a
difference
of
no
more
than
+/-001
in
the
estimated
propensity
score
for
receiving
pioglitazone
therapy
CHF
risk
was
examined
using
the
Cox
proportional-hazards
model
After
exclusion
of
ineligible
patients
1668
matched
pairs
of
patients
receiving
pioglitazone
or
insulin
were
identified
(509%
men
491%
women
mean
[SE]
age

[02]
years)
The
2-year
crude
incidence
rate
of
CHF
was
significantly
lower
in
the
pioglitazone
group
compared
with
the
insulin
group
(primary/secondary
diagnosis
of
CHF
20%
vs
40%
respectively
P
<
0001
inpatient
hospitalization
for
CHF
07%
vs
25%
P
<
0001)
The
hazard
ratio
for
pioglitazone
versus
insulin
was
0501
(95%
CI
0331-0758
P
=
0001)
for
a
primary
or
secondary
diagnosis
of
CHF
in
any
setting
and
0263
(95%
CI
0135-0511
P
<
0001)
for
any
occurrence
of
an
inpatient
hospitalization
for
CHF
In
this
retrospective
analysis
of
data
from
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
pioglitazone
therapy
was
associated
with
significantly
lower
incidence
rates
of
CHF
and
inpatient
hospitalization
compared
with
insulin
therapy
