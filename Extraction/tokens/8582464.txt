Title
Comparative
efficacy
of
hamamelis
distillate
and
hydrocortisone
cream
in
atopic
eczema
Abstract
Text
In
a
double-blind
randomized
paired
trial
lasting
14
days
in
72
patients
with
moderately
severe
atopic
eczema
hamamelis
distillate
cream
(535
g
hamamelis
distillate
with
064
mg
ketone/100
g)
was
compared
with
the
corresponding
drug-free
vehicle
and
05%
hydrocortisone
cream
and
reductions
of
the
basic
criteria
of
severe
atopic
eczema
(delta
values
of
the
sum
scores)
ie
itching
erythema
and
scaling
were
evaluated
Thirty-six
patients
in
each
group
were
treated
which
allowed
the
detection
of
a
10%
difference
between
verum
and
control
(confirmatory
study)
Effects
were
compared
using
Wilcoxon's
test
The
mean
sum
scores
of
the
basic
criteria
of
the
test
areas
were
53-55
All
treatment
regimens
significantly
reduced
itching
erythema
and
scaling
after
1
week
Hydrocortisone
proved
superior
to
hamamelis
distillate
The
basic
criteria
scores
decreased
by
27
and
16
respectively
The
delta
values
of
the
minor
criteria
and
the
global
rating
of
efficacy
were
also
used
to
indicate
the
difference
between
these
preparations
Hamamelis
distillate
cream
however
did
not
differ
from
the
vehicle
Mean
delta
values
of
basic
criteria
were
18
and
20
respectively
All
preparations
were
well
tolerated
Unwanted
cutaneous
reactions
occurred
in
six
patients
although
due
to
their
inflammatory
nature
and
their
confinement
to
vehicle-treated
patients
they
may
not
represent
true
adverse
effects
but
rather
a
lack
of
efficacy
The
results
prove
the
superiority
of
low-dose
hydrocortisone
cream
over
hamamelis
distillate
cream
and
the
therapeutic
outcome
following
this
preparation
was
no
better
than
following
the
base
preparation
The
mild
yet
unmistakable
anti-inflammatory
effect
of
hamamelis
cream
in
experimental
models
of
inflammatory
skin
disease
was
thus
not
reflected
by
an
efficacy
in
patients
with
atopic
eczema
greater
than
that
obtained
from
the
base
preparation
