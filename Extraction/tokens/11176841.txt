Title
Derivation
and
validation
of
guidelines
for
stool
cultures
for
enteropathogenic
bacteria
other
than
Clostridium
difficile
in
hospitalized
adults
Abstract
Text
The
yield
of
in-hospital
stool
cultures
performed
more
than
72
hours
after
admission
is
low
and
a
commonly
used
policy
dictates
that
laboratories
reject
these
cultures
to
save
costs
However
enteropathogenic
bacteria
other
than
Clostridium
difficile
(EPB)
may
cause
nosocomial
illness
that
would
be
missed
by
use
of
such
a
"3-day
rule"
To
develop
guidelines
for
hospital
use
of
stool
cultures
that
are
sensitive
to
clinically
relevant
cases
of
sporadic
and
epidemic
nosocomial
diarrhea
Five-part
study
that
incorporated
a
derivation
sample
based
on
retrospective
chart
review
and
a
prospective
cohort
study
(including
cost
savings
analysis)
and
a
validation
sample
based
on
retrospective
chart
review
Four
European
academic
health
care
centers
Derivation
sample
1735
adult
inpatients
from
whom
3416
stool
cultures
were
obtained
during
a
19-month
period
(1995-1997)
and
68
adult
inpatients
for
whom
EPB
were
grown
from
stool
cultures
during
a
10-year
period
(1988-1998)
validation
sample
65
patients
with
sporadic
isolation
of
EPB
(1993-1998)
56
patients
involved
in
2
nosocomial
Salmonella
outbreaks
(1992
and
1997)
and
330
patients
who
had
stool
cultures
performed
(1998)
Performance
of
derived
criteria
in
detecting
pathogenic
bacteria
and
outbreaks
and
reducing
total
number
of
stool
cultures
performed
Stool
cultures
grew
EPB
in
33%
of
samples
obtained
</=72
hours
after
admission
and
05%
of
samples
obtained
thereafter
(P<001)
Isolation
of
EPB
>72
hours
after
admission
was
not
associated
with
clinical
symptoms
or
signs
but
was
associated
with
community-acquired
diarrhea
(24%)
age
65
years
or
older
with
preexisting
comorbid
disease
(25%)
neutropenia
(13%)
HIV
infection
(10%)
and
nondiarrheal
manifestations
of
enteric
infections
(16%)
Twelve
percent
were
asymptomatic
carriers
These
characteristics
were
used
to
create
criteria
for
selecting
patients
for
whom
stool
cultures
would
be
indicated
These
criteria
were
applied
post
hoc
to
a
series
of
1025
stool
cultures
the
number
of
stool
cultures
would
have
been
reduced
by
52%
and
no
clinically
significant
cases
would
have
been
missed
Annual
savings
to
a
355-bed
institution
would
be
approximately
$7800
for
reagent
costs
and
75
hours
of
technician
time
In
the
validation
samples
only
2
patients
of
65
who
had
EPB
would
not
have
been
identified
and
neither
required
treatment
If
the
3-day
rule
had
been
applied
52
cases
would
not
have
been
identified
28
of
which
required
antibiotic
treatment
Our
modified
3-day
rule
for
use
in
selecting
cases
for
stool
culture
is
sensitive
to
sporadic
and
epidemic
cases
of
nosocomial
diarrhea
in
hospitalized
adults
