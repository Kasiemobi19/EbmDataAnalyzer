A
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
of
oral
nalmefene
for
alcohol
dependence
Abstract
Text
Nalmefene
is
a
newer
opioid
antagonist
that
is
structurally
similar
to
naltrexone
but
with
a
number
of
potential
pharmacological
advantages
for
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
including
no
dose-dependent
association
with
toxic
effects
to
the
liver
greater
oral
bioavailability
longer
duration
of
antagonist
action
and
more
competitive
binding
with
opioid
receptor
subtypes
that
are
thought
to
reinforce
drinking
A
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
was
conducted
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
2
doses
of
oral
nalmefene
for
alcohol
dependence
The
105
outpatient
volunteers
were
abstinent
for
a
mean
of
2
weeks
prior
to
random
assignment
to
the
placebo
or
20-
or
80-mg/d
dose
nalmefene
groups
for
12
weeks
Cognitive
behavioral
therapy
was
provided
weekly
during
treatment
Self-reported
drinking
or
abstinence
was
confirmed
by
determinations
of
breath
alcohol
concentration
and
by
collateral
informant
reports
Outcomes
did
not
differ
between
the
20-
and
80-mg
dose
nalmefene
groups
Significantly
fewer
patients
treated
with
nalmefene
than
patients
given
placebo
relapsed
to
heavy
drinking
through
12
weeks
of
treatment
(P<02)
with
a
significant
treatment
effect
at
the
first
weekly
study
visit
(P<02)
The
odds
ratio
of
relapsing
to
heavy
drinking
was
24
times
greater
with
placebo
compared
with
nalmefene
(95%
confidence
interval
105-559)
Patients
treated
with
nalmefene
also
had
fewer
subsequent
relapses
(P<03)
than
patients
given
placebo
Treatment
with
nalmefene
was
effective
in
preventing
relapse
to
heavy
drinking
relative
to
placebo
in
alcohol-dependent
outpatients
and
was
accompanied
by
acceptable
side
effects
