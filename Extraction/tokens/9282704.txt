Neonatal
morbidity
after
elective
repeat
cesarean

and
trial
of
labor
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
neonatal
outcomes
after
an
elective
repeat
cesarean
section
(ERCS)
compared
with
a
trial
of
labor
(TOL)
All
mothers
who
underwent
previous
cesarean
section
and
delivered
singleton
infants
at
term
gestation
were
identified
during
a
1-year
period
Neonatal
outcomes
were
compared
between
infants
delivered
by
ERCS
(n
=
497)
and
those
delivered
by
TOL
(n
=
492)
and
between
infants
delivered
by
a
successful
(n
=
336)
and
a
failed
(n
=
156)
TOL
A
cohort
of
mothers
and
their
term
infants
delivered
by
routine
vaginal
delivery
were
also
identified
Infants
delivered
by
ERCS
had
an
increased
rate
of
transient
tachypnea
compared
with
infants
born
by
TOL
(6%
vs
3%)
Compared
with
routine
vaginal
deliveries
the
adjusted
odds
ratio
of
developing
any
respiratory
problem
after
an
ERCS
was
23
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
14
38)
and
for
developing
transient
tachypnea
was
26
(CI
15
45)
In
addition
two
infants
delivered
by
ERCS
developed
respiratory
distress
syndrome
Infants
delivered
after
a
TOL
had
increased
rates
of
suspected
and
proven
sepsis
(5%
vs
2%
and
1%
vs
01%
respectively)
Compared
with
a
successful
TOL
the
infants
delivered
by
cesarean
section
after
a
failed
TOL
had
more
neonatal
morbidity
and
had
a
longer
hospital
stay
(48
+/-
2
vs
31
+/-
2
days)
The
odds
ratio
for
developing
any
respiratory
illness
after
a
failed
TOL
was
21
(95%
CI
11
41)
for
suspected
sepsis
was
48
(95%
CI
26
90)
and
for
proven
sepsis
was
193
(95%
CI
20
187)
Neonatal
outcomes
after
a
successful
TOL
were
similar
to
routine
vaginal
births
Infants
born
by
ERCS
are
at
increased
risk
for
developing
respiratory
problems
compared
with
those
born
by
TOL
However
TOL
is
associated
with
increased
rates
of
suspected
and
proven
sepsis
This
appears
to
be
limited
to
infants
delivered
by
cesarean
section
after
a
failed
TOL
