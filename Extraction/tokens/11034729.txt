Title
Exercise-based
rehabilitation
for
coronary
heart
disease
Abstract
Text
The
burden
of
cardiovascular
disease
world-wide
is
one
of
great
concern
to
patients
and
health
care
agencies
alike
Circulatory
diseases
including
myocardial
infarction
(MI)
and
stroke
kill
more
people
than
any
other
disease
Cardiac
rehabilitation
aims
to
restore
patients
who
have
suffered
myocardial
infarction
to
optimal
health
through
exercise
only
based
rehabilitation
or
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
(eg
smoking
cessation
advice
diet
and
counselling
as
well
as
exercise)
Data
from
two
published
and
widely
cited
meta-analyses
(Oldridge
1988
O'Connor
1989)
of
over
4000
patients
each
have
demonstrated
that
patients
randomised
to
exercise-based
cardiac
rehabilitation
after
MI
have
a
statistically
significant
reduction
in
all-cause
and
cardiac
mortality
of
about
20
to
25%
compared
to
patients
receiving
conventional
care
However
the
trials
included
were
small
and
often
of
poor
methodological
quality
Incomplete
literature
review
methods
may
have
resulted
in
publication
bias
thereby
resulting
in
an
over-estimate
of
the
benefit
of
cardiac
rehabilitation
The
randomised
controlled
trials
used
in
the
reviews
have
focused
almost
exclusively
on
low-risk
middle-aged
males
post
MI
thereby
excluding
women
and
the
elderly
To
determine
the
effectiveness
of
exercise
only
rehabilitation
and
exercise
in
addition
to
other
rehabilitation
interventions
(termed
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation)
compared
with
usual
care
on
the
mortality
morbidity
health-related
quality
of
life
(HRQoL)
and
modifiable
cardiac
risk
factors
of
patients
with
coronary
heart
disease
Electronic
databases
were
searched
for
randomised
controlled
trials
using
standardised
trial
filters
from
the
earliest
date
available
to
December
31st
1998
Men
and
women
of
all
ages
in
both
hospital-based
and
community-based
settings
who
have
had
myocardial
infarction
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
or
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
or
who
have
angina
pectoris
or
coronary
artery
disease
defined
by
angiography
have
been
included
Studies
involving
participants
following
heart
transplant
heart
valve
surgery
or
heart
failure
have
been
excluded
Follow
up
periods
of
less
than
6
months
were
excluded
Studies
were
selected
independently
by
two
reviewers
and
data
extracted
independently
Authors
were
contacted
where
possible
to
obtain
missing
information
The
current
systematic
review
has
allowed
analysis
of
an
increased
number
of
patients
from
approximately
4500
in
the
earlier
meta-analyses
to
7683
(2582
in
exercise
only
and
5101
in
the
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
group)
The
quality
of
reporting
overall
was
poor
with
generally
high
losses
to
follow
up
The
pooled
effect
estimate
for
total
mortality
for
the
exercise
only
intervention
shows
a
27%
reduction
in
all
cause
mortality
(random
effects
model
OR
073
(054
098))
Similarly
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
reduced
all
cause
mortality
compared
to
usual
care
but
to
a
lesser
degree
(OR
087
(071
105))
Total
cardiac
mortality
was
reduced
by
31%
(random
effects
model
OR
069
(051
094))
and
26%
(random
effects
model
OR
074
(057
096))
in
the
exercise
only
and
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
intervention
groups
respectively
when
compared
to
usual
care
Neither
intervention
had
any
effect
on
the
ocurrence
of
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
There
was
a
significant
net
reduction
in
total
cholesterol
in
the
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
group
(pooled
WMD
random
effects
model
-057
mmol/l
(-083
-031))
but
not
the
exercise
only
rehabilitation
group
Similarly
LDL
was
significantly
reduced
in
the
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
group
(pooled
WMD
random
effects
model
-051
mmol/l
(-082
-019)
The
effect
of
exercise
only
rehabilitation
or
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
interventions
on
revascularisation
rates
blood
pressure
or
smoking
behaviour
could
not
be
determined
by
this
meta-analysis
due
to
the
small
number
of
trials
reporting
these
outcomes
and
heterogeneity
between
trials
It
was
not
possible
to
combine
the
data
from
studies
reporting
HRQoL
as
an
outcome
Eighteen
different
instruments
were
used
to
assess
HRQoL
in
the
11
studies
reporting
it
as
an
outcome
The
data
are
presented
qualitatively
only
one
trial
reporting
significant
improvements
with
the
intervention
Exercise-based
cardiac
rehabilitation
appears
to
be
effective
in
reducing
cardiac
deaths
but
the
evidence
base
is
weakened
by
poor
quality
trials
It
is
not
clear
from
this
review
whether
exercise
only
or
a
comprehensive
cardiac
rehabilitation
intervention
is
more
beneficial
The
population
studied
in
this
review
is
still
predominately
male
middle
aged
and
low
risk
Identification
of
the
ethnic
origin
of
the
participants
was
seldom
reported
