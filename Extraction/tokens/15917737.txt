Title
Prevention
and
control
of
meningococcal
disease
Recommendations
of
the
Advisory
Committee
on
Immunization
Practices
(ACIP)
Abstract
Text
In
January
2005
a
tetravalent
meningococcal
polysaccharide-protein
conjugate
vaccine
([MCV4]
Menactra
manufactured
by
Sanofi
Pasteur
Inc
Swiftwater
Pennsylvania)
was
licensed
for
use
among
persons
aged
11-55
years
CDCns
Advisory
Committee
on
Immunization
Practices
(ACIP)
recommends
routine
vaccination
of
young
adolescents
(defined
in
this
report
as
persons
aged
11-12
years)
with
MCV4
at
the
preadolescent
health-care
visit
(at
age
11-12
years)
Introducing
a
recommendation
for
MCV4
vaccination
among
young
adolescents
might
strengthen
the
role
of
the
preadolescent
visit
and
have
a
positive
effect
on
vaccine
coverage
among
adolescents
For
those
persons
who
have
not
previously
received
MCV4
ACIP
recommends
vaccination
before
high-school
entry
(at
approximately
age
15
years)
as
an
effective
strategy
to
reduce
meningococcal
disease
incidence
among
adolescents
and
young
adults
By
2008
the
goal
will
be
routine
vaccination
with
MCV4
of
all
adolescents
beginning
at
age
11
years
Routine
vaccination
with
meningococcal
vaccine
also
is
recommended
for
college
freshmen
living
in
dormitories
and
for
other
populations
at
increased
risk
(ie
military
recruits
travelers
to
areas
in
which
meningococcal
disease
is
hyperendemic
or
epidemic
microbiologists
who
are
routinely
exposed
to
isolates
of
Neisseria
meningitidis
patients
with
anatomic
or
functional
asplenia
and
patients
with
terminal
complement
deficiency)
Other
adolescents
college
students
and
persons
infected
with
human
immunodeficiency
virus
who
wish
to
decrease
their
risk
for
meningococcal
disease
may
elect
to
receive
vaccine
This
report
updates
previous
reports
from
ACIP
concerning
prevention
and
control
of
meningococcal
disease
It
also
provides
updated
recommendations
regarding
use
of
the
tetravalent
meningococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
(MPSV4)
and
on
antimicrobial
chemoprophylaxis
