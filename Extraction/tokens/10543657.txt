(ACIP)
Abstract
Text
Routine
vaccination
of
children
is
the
most
effective
way
to
reduce
hepatitis
A
incidence
nationwide
over
time
Since
licensure
of
hepatitis
A
vaccine
in
1995
this
strategy
has
been
implemented
incrementally
starting
with
the
recommendation
of
the
Advisory
Committee
on
Immunization
Practices
(ACIP)
in
1996
to
vaccinate
children
living
in
communities
with
the
highest
rates
of
infection
and
disease
These
updated
recommendations
represent
the
next
phase
of
this
hepatitis
A
immunization
strategy
Vaccination
of
children
living
in
states
and
communities
with
consistently
elevated
rates
of
hepatitis
A
will
provide
protection
from
disease
and
is
expected
to
reduce
the
overall
incidence
of
hepatitis
A
This
report
updates
the
ACIP's
1996
recommendations
on
the
prevention
of
hepatitis
A
through
immunization
(MMWR
199645[No
RR-151)
and
includes
a)
new
data
about
the
epidemiology
of
hepatitis
A
b)
recent
findings
about
the
effectiveness
of
community-based
hepatitis
A
vaccination
programs
and
c)
recommendations
for
the
routine
vaccination
of
children
in
states
counties
and
communities
with
rates
that
are
twice
the
1987-1997
national
average
or
greater
(ie
>
or
=
20
cases
per
100000
population)
and
consideration
of
routine
vaccination
of
children
in
states
counties
and
communities
with
rates
exceeding
the
1987-1997
national
average
(ie
>
or
=
10
but
<20
cases
per
100000
population)
Unchanged
in
this
report
are
previous
recommendations
regarding
the
vaccination
of
persons
in
groups
at
increased
risk
for
hepatitis
A
or
its
adverse
consequences
and
recommendations
regarding
the
use
of
immune
globulin
for
protection
against
hepatitis
