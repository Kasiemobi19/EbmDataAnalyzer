Abstract
Text
Our
objective
was
to
evaluate
the
risks
of
maternal
and
perinatal
morbidity
associated
with
induction
of
labour
in
uncomplicated
term
pregnancies
We
conducted
a
retrospective
cohort
study
including
7430
women
not
referred
from
another
institution
with
a
single
baby
in
vertex
presentation
and
delivering
between
38
and
40
weeks
of
pregnancy
Among
these
women
3546
were
excluded
for
prelabour
pregnancy
complications
Relative
risks
(RR)
adjusted
for
parity
were
computed
to
compare
3353
women
who
went
into
labour
spontaneously
with
531
women
whose
labour
was
induced
Induction
of
labour
was
found
to
be
associated
with
a
higher
risk
of
caesarean
section
[RR
=
24
95%
CI

Use
of
non-epidural
[RR
=

95%
CI

and
of
epidural
analgesia
[RR
=
14
95%
CI

17]
was
more
frequent
after
labour
induction
Resuscitation
[RR
=
12
95%
CI

admission
to
the
intensive
care
unit
[RR
=
16
95%
CI

and
phototherapy
[RR
=
13
95%
CI
10
16]
were
more
frequent
after
induction
of
labour
Results
were
similar
when
controlling
simultaneously
for
parity
maternal
age
gestational
age
year
of
delivery
birthweight
and
the
physician
in
charge
of
delivery
in
a
logistic
regression
analysis
The
results
of
this
study
suggests
that
induction
of
labour
is
associated
with
a
higher
risk
of
caesarean
section
and
of
some
perinatal
adverse
outcomes
Induction
of
labour
should
be
reserved
for
cases
where
maternal
and
perinatal
benefits
outweigh
the
risk
of
these
complications
