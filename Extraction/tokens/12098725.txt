Abstract
Text
To
identify
which
children
with
acute
otitis
media
are
at
risk
of
poor
outcome
and
to
assess
benefit
from
antibiotics
in
these
children
Secondary
analysis
of
randomised
controlled
trial
cohort
Primary
care
315
children
aged
6
months
to
10
years
Immediate
or
delayed
(taken
after
72
hours
if
necessary)
antibiotics
Predictors
of
short
term
outcome
an
episode
of
distress
or
night
disturbance
three
days
after
child
saw
doctor
Distress
by
day
three
was
more
likely
in
children
with
high
temperature
(adjusted
odds
ratio
45
95%
confidence
interval
23
to
90)
vomiting
(2613
to
50)
and
cough
(20
11
to
38)
on
day
one
Night
disturbance
by
day
three
was
more
likely
with
high
temperature
24
(12
to

vomiting
(2111
to

cough
(2313
to
42)
and
ear
discharge
(21
12
to
39)
Among
the
children
with
high
temperature
or
vomiting
distress
by
day
three
was
less
likely
with
immediate
antibiotics
(32%
for
immediate
v
53%
for
delayed
chi2=40
P=0045
number

to
treat

as
was
night
disturbance
(26%
v
59%
chi2=93
P=0002
number
needed
to
treat
3)
In
children
without
higher
temperature
or
vomiting
immediate
antibiotics
made
little
difference
to
distress
by
day
three
(15%
v
19%
chi2=074
P=039)
or
night
disturbance
(20%
v
27%
chi2=16
P=020)
Addition
of
cough
did
not
significantly
improve
prediction
of
benefit
In
children
with
otitis
media
but
without
fever
and
vomiting
antibiotic
treatment
has
little
benefit
and
a
poor
outcome
is
unlikely
