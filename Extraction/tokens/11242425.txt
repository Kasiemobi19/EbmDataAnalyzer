Abstract
Text
Current
evidence
that
breastfeeding
is
beneficial
for
infant
and
child
health
is
based
exclusively
on
observational
studies
Potential
sources
of
bias
in
such
studies
have
led
to
doubts
about
the
magnitude
of
these
health
benefits
in
industrialized
countries
To
assess
the
effects
of
breastfeeding
promotion
on
breastfeeding
duration
and
exclusivity
and
gastrointestinal
and
respiratory
infection
and
atopic
eczema
among
infants
The
Promotion
of
Breastfeeding
Intervention
Trial
(PROBIT)
a
cluster-randomized
trial
conducted
June
1996-December
1997
with
a
1-year
follow-up
Thirty-one
maternity
hospitals
and
polyclinics
in
the
Republic
of
Belarus
A
total
of
17
046
mother-infant
pairs
consisting
of
full-term
singleton
infants
weighing
at
least
2500
g
and
their
healthy
mothers
who
intended
to
breastfeed
16491
(967%)
of
which
completed
the
entire
12
months
of
follow-up
Sites
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
an
experimental
intervention
(n
=
16)
modeled
on
the
Baby-Friendly
Hospital
Initiative
of
the
World
Health
Organization
and
United
Nations
Children's
Fund
which
emphasizes
health
care
worker
assistance
with
initiating
and
maintaining
breastfeeding
and
lactation
and
postnatal
breastfeeding
support
or
a
control
intervention
(n
=
15)
of
continuing
usual
infant
feeding
practices
and
policies
Duration
of
any
breastfeeding
prevalence
of
predominant
and
exclusive
breastfeeding
at
3
and
6
months
of
life
and
occurrence
of
1
or
more
episodes
of
gastrointestinal
tract
infection
2
or
more
episodes
of
respiratory
tract
infection
and
atopic
eczema
during
the
first
12
months
of
life
compared
between
the
intervention
and
control
groups
Infants
from
the
intervention
sites
were
significantly
more
likely
than
control
infants
to
be
breastfed
to
any
degree
at
12
months
(197%
vs
114%
adjusted
odds
ratio
[OR]
047
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]

were
more
likely
to
be
exclusively
breastfed
at
3
months
(433%
vs
64%
P<001)
and
at
6
months
(79%
vs
06%
P

and
had
a
significant
reduction
in
the
risk
of
1
or
more
gastrointestinal
tract
infections
(91%
vs
132%
adjusted
OR

and
of
atopic
eczema
(33%
vs
63%
adjusted
OR
054
95%
CI
031-095)
but
no
significant
reduction
in
respiratory
tract
infection
(intervention

392%
control
group
394%
adjusted
OR

95%
CI
059-128)
Our
experimental
intervention
increased
the
duration
and
degree
(exclusivity)
of
breastfeeding
and
decreased
the
risk
of
gastrointestinal
tract
infection
and
atopic
eczema
in
the
first
year
of
life
These
results
provide
a
solid
scientific
underpinning
for
future
interventions
to
promote
breastfeeding
