Abstract
Text
In
selective
IgA
deficiency
(IgAD)
there
is
no
reliable
screening
test
for
coeliac
disease
(CD)
To
evaluate
the
usefulness
of
IgG(1)
antiendomysium
and
IgG
antitissue
transglutaminase
tests
for
CD
diagnosis
in
IgAD
IgA
and
IgG
antigliadin
antibodies
(IgA-
and
IgG-AGA)
IgA
and
IgG(1)
antiendomysium
antibodies
(IgA-
and
IgG(1)-EMA)
and
IgA
and
IgG
antitissue
transglutaminase
(IgA-
and
IgG-anti-tTG)
were
assayed
in
(a)
20
untreated
IgAD/CD
patients
(b)
34
IgAD/CD
patients
on
a
strict
gluten
free
diet
(GFD)
(c)
10
IgAD/CD
patients
not
on
a
strict
GFD
(d)
11
untreated
CD
patients
without
IgAD
(e)
10
healthy
IgAD
patients
and
(f)
25
healthy
controls
In
all
untreated
IgAD/CD
patients
IgG(1)-EMA
IgG-anti-tTG
and
IgG-AGA
were
positive
whereas
IgA
antibodies
against
these
antigens
were
negative
IgAD/CD
patients
on
a
strict
GFD
did
not
produce
IgG-AGA
or
IgG(1)-EMA
but
four
of
34
produced
IgG
anti-tTG
IgAD/CD
subjects
not
on
a
strict
GFD
produced
IgG-AGA
whereas
5/10
and
4/10
were
IgG(1)-
EMA
and
IgG-anti-tTG
negative
respectively
Untreated
CD
patients
without
IgAD
were
AGA
(IgA
and
IgG)
EMA
(IgA
and
IgG(1))
and
anti-tTG
(IgA
and
IgG)
positive
Healthy
controls
were
AGA
and
EMA
negative
whereas
two
of
10
apparently
healthy
IgAD
subjects
and
one
of
25
healthy
negative
control
were
IgG-anti-tTG
positive
Both
IgG(1)-EMA
and
IgG-anti-tTG
tests
appear
to
be
useful
for
identification
of
IgAD/CD
patients
whereas
they
are
less
satisfactory
for
monitoring
dietary
compliance
in
these
subjects
In
addition
our
findings
seem
to
suggest
that
IgG-EMA
autoantibodies
produced
by
coeliac
patients
are
mainly
of
the
IgG(1)
subtype
