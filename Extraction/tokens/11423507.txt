diabetes
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
rosiglitazone
(RSG)
when
added
to
insulin
in
the
treatment
of
type
2
diabetic
patients
who
are
inadequately
controlled
on
insulin
monotherapy
After
8
weeks
of
insulin
standardization
and
placebo
(PBO)
run-in
319
type
2
diabetic
patients
with
mean
baseline
HbA(1c)
>
or
=
75%
(89
+/-
11
to
91
+/-
13)
on
twice-daily
insulin
therapy
(total
daily
dose
>
or
=
30
U)
were
randomized
to
26
weeks
of
additional
treatment
with
RSG
(4
or
8
mg
daily)
or
PBO
Insulin
dose
could
be
down-
titrated
only
for
safety
reasons
The
primary
end
point
was
reduction
of
HbA(1c)
from
baseline
RSG
4
and
8
mg
daily
significantly
improved
glycemic
control
which
was
unchanged
on
PBO
By
intent-to-treat
analysis
treatment
with
RSG
8
mg
plus
insulin
resulted
in
a
mean
reduction
from
baseline
in
HbA(1c)
of
12%
(P
<
00001)
despite
a
12%
mean
reduction
of
insulin
dosage
Over
50%
of
subjects
treated
daily
with
RSG
8
mg
plus
insulin
had
a
reduction
of
HbA(1c)
>
or
=
10%
Neither
totalHDL
cholesterol
nor
LDLHDL
cholesterol
ratios
significantly
changed
with
RSG
treatment
Serious
adverse
events
did
not
differ
among
groups
The
addition
of
RSG
to
insulin
treatment
results
in
significant
improvement
in
glycemic
control
and
is
generally
well
tolerated
