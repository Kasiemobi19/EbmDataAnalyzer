in
this

are
current
life

States
based
on
age-specific
death
rates
in

Beginning
with

mortality
data
complete
US
life
tables
were
constructed
using
a
new
methodology
that
replaces
the
abridged
life
table
methodology
used
previously
The
methodology
is
similar
to
that
used
in
the
decennial
life
tables
Also
life
expectancy
and
other
life
table
values
are
shown
for
ages
85
to
100
years
for
the
first
time
as
part
of
the
annual
US
life
tables
Data
used
to
prepare
these
life
tables
are
1997
final
mortality
statistics
