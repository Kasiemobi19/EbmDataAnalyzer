comparing
cryotherapy
(liquid

and
trichloroacetic
acid
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
and
compare
the
efficacy
and
adverse
effects
of
trichloracetic
acid
and
cryotherapy
(using
liquid
nitrogen)
in
the
treatment
of
external
genital
warts
Eighty-six
patients
were
enrolled
into
a
randomized
clinical
trial
in
the
Genitourinary
Medicine
Department
of
the
Coventry
and
Warwickshire
Hospital
(Coventry)
between
November
1990
and
June
1991
External
genital
warts
were
treated
with
either
trichloracetic
acid
or
cryotherapy
(using
liquid
nitrogen)
on
a
once
weekly
basis
They
received
up
to
six
treatments
of
either
therapy
Complete
clearance
of
warts
in
patients
who
received
up
to
six
treatments
of
cryotherapy
were
observed
in
86%
of
cases
and
in
70%
of
patients
who
received
up
to
six
treatments
of
trichloracetic
acid
Thirty
percent
of
patients
who
were
treated
with
trichloracetic
acid
developed
ulcerations
at
the
site
of
its
application
In
this
study
we
found
that
cryotherapy
(using
liquid
nitrogen)
is
more
effective
than
that
of
trichloracetic
acid
for
the
treatment
of
external
genital
warts
It
is
also
less
likely
to
cause
ulceration
