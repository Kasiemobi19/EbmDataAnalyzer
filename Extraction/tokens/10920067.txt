Differential
effects
of
beta-blockers
in
patients
with
heart
failure
A
prospective
randomized
double-blind
comparison
of
the
long-term
effects
of
metoprolol
versus
carvedilol
Abstract
Text
Both
metoprolol
and
carvedilol
produce
hemodynamic
and
clinical
benefits
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
carvedilol
exerts
greater
antiadrenergic
effects
than
metoprolol
but
it
is
unknown
whether
this
pharmacological
difference
results
in
hemodynamic
and
clinical
differences
between
the
2
drugs
We
randomized
150
patients
with
heart
failure
(left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
</=035)
to
double-blind
treatment
with
either
metoprolol
or
carvedilol
When
compared
with
metoprolol
(124+/-55
mg/d)
patients
treated
with
carvedilol
(49+/-18
mg/d)
showed
larger
increases
in
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
at
rest
(+109+/-110
versus
+72+/-77
U
P=0038)
and
in
left
ventricular
stroke
volume
and
stroke
work
during
exercise
(both
P<0
05)
after
13
to
15
months
of
treatment
In
addition
carvedilol
produced
greater
decreases
in
mean
pulmonary
artery
pressure
and
pulmonary
wedge
pressure
both
at
rest
and
during
exercise
than
metoprolol
(all
P<005)
In
contrast
the
metoprolol
group
showed
greater
increases
in
maximal
exercise
capacity
than
the
carvedilol
group
(P=0035)
but
the
2
drugs
improved
symptoms
submaximal
exercise
tolerance
and
quality
of
life
to
a
similar
degree
After
a
mean
of
23+/-11
months
of
follow-up
21
patients
in
the
metoprolol
group
and
17
patients
in
the
carvedilol
group
died
or
underwent
urgent
transplantation
The
present
study
demonstrates
that
during
long-term
therapy
carvedilol
improves
cardiac
performance
to
a
greater
extent
than
metoprolol
when
administered
to
patients
with
heart
failure
in
the
doses
shown
to
be
effective
in
clinical
trials
These
differences
were
likely
related
to
a
greater
antiadrenergic
activity
of
carvedilol
