Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
safety
of
fluoroquinolones
(FQ)
in
comparison
with
other
antibiotics
in
pediatric
patients
A
multicenter
observational
comparative
cohort
study
was
conducted
between
1998
and
2000
in
French
pediatric
departments
Patients
who
were
receiving
systemic
FQ
were
included
and
matched
to
control
patients
who
were
receiving
other
antibiotics
Antibiotic-associated
potential
adverse
events
(PAEs)
were
recorded
prospectively
in
both
groups
and
their
rates
were
compared
using
univariate
and
multivariate
analyses
Patients
were
recruited
from
73
centers
276
patients
were
exposed
to
FQ
and
249
composed
the
control
group
Among
patients
who
were
exposed
to
FQ
23%
were
younger
than
2
years
33%
had
cystic
fibrosis
and
PAEs
occurred
in
52
patients
leading
to
withdrawal
for
11
The
odds
ratio
for
PAE
in
the
FQ
group
was
37
(95%
confidence
interval
19-75)
and
was
not
significantly
modified
after
adjustment
for
potential
confounders
Musculoskeletal
PAEs
also
occurred
more
frequently
in
the
FQ
group
(38%)
than
in
controls
(04%)
they
were
recorded
in
10
patients
who
were
receiving
standard
FQ
doses
and
were
of
moderate
intensity
and
transient
The
rates
of
PAEs
and
musculoskeletal
PAEs
were
higher
for
the
FQ
group
than
the
control
group
This
observation
supports
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
statement
restricting
off-label
FQ
use
in
pediatric
patients
to
second-line
treatment
in
a
limited
number
of
situations
