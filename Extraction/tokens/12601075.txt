Long-term
low-intensity
warfarin
therapy
for
the
prevention
of
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
Abstract
Text
Standard
therapy
to
prevent
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
includes
3
to
12
months
of
treatment
with
full-dose
warfarin
with
a
target
international
normalized
ratio
(INR)
between
20
and
30
However
for
long-term
management
no
therapeutic
agent
has
shown
an
acceptable
benefit-to-risk
ratio
Patients
with
idiopathic
venous
thromboembolism
who
had
received
full-dose
anticoagulation
therapy
for
a
median
of
65
months
were
randomly
assigned
to
placebo
or
low-intensity
warfarin
(target
INR
15
to
20)
Participants
were
followed
for
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
major
hemorrhage
and
death
The
trial
was
terminated
early
after
508
patients
had
undergone
randomization
and
had
been
followed
for
up
to
43
years
(mean
21)
Of
253
patients
assigned
to
placebo
37
had
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
(72
per
100
person-years)
as
compared
with
14
of
255
patients
assigned
to
low-intensity
warfarin
(26
per
100
person-years)
a
risk
reduction
of
64
percent
(hazard
ratio
036
[95
percent
confidence
interval
019
to
067]
P<0001)
Risk
reductions
were
similar
for
all
subgroups
including
those
with
and
those
without
inherited
thrombophilia
Major
hemorrhage
occurred
in
two
patients
assigned
to
placebo
and
five
assigned
to
low-intensity
warfarin
(P=025)
Eight
patients
in
the
placebo
group
and
four
in
the
group
assigned
to
low-intensity
warfarin
died
(P=026)
Low-intensity
warfarin
was
thus
associated
with
a
48
percent
reduction
in
the
composite
end
point
of
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
major
hemorrhage
or
death
According
to
per-protocol
and
as-treated
analyses
the
reduction
in
the
risk
of
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
was
between
76
and
81
percent
Long-term
low-intensity
warfarin
therapy
is
a
highly
effective
method
of
preventing
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
