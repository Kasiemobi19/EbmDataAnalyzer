Title
Comparative
safety
of
tetracycline
minocycline
and
doxycycline
Abstract
Text
Because
minocycline
can
cause
serious
adverse
events
including
hypersensitivity
syndrome
reaction
(HSR)
serum
sicknesslike
reaction
(SSLR)
and
drug-induced
lupus
a
follow-up
study
based
on
a
retrospective
review
of
our
Drug
Safety
Clinic
and
the
Health
Protection
Branch
databases
and
a
literature
review
was
conducted
to
determine
if
similar
rare
events
are
associated
with
tetracycline
and
doxycycline
Cases
of
isolated
single
organ
dysfunction
(SOD)
attributable
to
the
use
of
these
antibiotics
also
were
identified
Nineteen
cases
of
HSR
due
to
minocycline
2
due
to
tetracycline
and
1
due
to
doxycycline
were
identified
Eleven
cases
of
SSLR
due
to
minocycline
3
due
to
tetracycline
and
2
due
to
doxycycline
were
identified
All
33
cases
of
drug-induced
lupus
were
attributable
to
minocycline
Forty
cases
of
SOD
from
minocycline
37
cases
from
tetracycline
and
6
from
doxycycline
were
detected
Hypersensitivity
syndrome
reaction
SSLR
and
SOD
occur
on
average
within
4
weeks
of
therapy
whereas
minocycline-induced
lupus
occurs
on
average
2
years
after
the
initiation
of
therapy
Early
serious
events
occurring
during
the
course
of
tetracycline
antibiotic
treatment
include
HSR
SSLR
and
SOD
Drug-induced
lupus
which
occurs
late
in
the
course
of
therapy
is
reported
only
with
minocycline
We
theorize
that
minocycline
metabolism
may
account
for
the
increased
frequency
of
serious
adverse
events
with
this
drug
