Title
Addition
of
low-dose
rosiglitazone
to
sulphonylurea
therapy
improves
glycaemic
control
in
Type
2
diabetic
patients
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
designed
to
test
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
low-dose
rosiglitazone
a
potent
insulin-sensitizing
thiazolidinedione
in
combination
with
sulphonylurea
in
Type
2
diabetic
patients
For
the
intention-to-treat
analysis
574
patients
(59%
male
mean
age
61
years)
were
available
randomized
to
receive
26
weeks
of
twice-daily
placebo
(n
=
192)
rosiglitazone
1
mg
(n
=
199)
or
rosiglitazone
2
mg
(n
=
183)
in
addition
to
existing
sulphonylurea
treatment
with
gliclazide
(476%
of
patients)
glibenclamide
(418%)
or
glipizide
(94%)
(two
patients
were
taking
carbutamide
or
glimepiride)
Change
in
haemoglobin
A1c
(HbA1c)
fasting
plasma
glucose
(FPG)
fructosamine
insulin
C-peptide
albumin
and
lipids
were
measured
and
safety
was
evaluated
Mean
baseline
HbA1c
was
92%
and
FPG
was
114
mmol/l
Rosiglitazone
at
doses
of
1
and
2
mg
bd
plus
sulphonylurea
produced
significant
decreases
compared
with
sulphonylurea
plus
placebo
in
HbA1c
(-059%
and
-103%
respectively
both
P<00001)
and
FPG
(135
mmol/l
and
244
mmol/l
respectively
both
P<00001)
Both
HDL-cholesterol
and
LDL-cholesterol
increased
and
potentially
beneficial
decreases
in
non-esterified
fatty
acids
and
gamma
glutamyl
transpeptidase
levels
were
seen
in
both
rosiglitazone
groups
The
overall
incidence
of
adverse
experiences
was
similar
in
all
three
treatment
groups
with
no
significant
cardiac
events
hypoglycaemia
or
hepatotoxicity
Overall
the
combination
of
rosiglitazone
and
a
sulphonylurea
was
safe
well
tolerated
and
effective
in
patients
with
Type
2
diabetes
