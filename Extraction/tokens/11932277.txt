Lipoprotein
profile
in
subclinical
hypothyroidism
response
to
levothyroxine
replacement
a
randomized
placebo-controlled
study
Abstract
Text
The
relationship
between
subclinical
hypothyroidism
(SCH)
and
an
atherogenic
lipoprotein
profile
is
still
controversial
We
measured
lipoproteins
in
49
SCH
patients
by
comparison
with
33
euthyroid
controls
Total
cholesterol
(TC)
triglyceride
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDLc)
apolipoprotein
A(1)
apolipoprotein
B
and
lipoprotein
(a)
[Lp(a)]
were
measured
after
an
overnight
fast
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
levothyroxine
therapy
or
placebo
and
re-evaluated
after
6
months
of
euthyroidism
SCH
patients
showed
significantly
higher
TC
(P
<
001)
LDLc
(P
=
001)
and
apolipoprotein
B
(P
=
0001)
levels
than
controls
positively
correlated
with
baseline
TSH
levels
(P
=
0003
P
=
001
and
P
=
003
respectively)
Elevated
Lp(a)
levels
were
significantly
more
frequent
in
SCH
(P
<
005)
and
associated
with
familial
diabetes
mellitus
and/or
coronary
heart
disease
(P
<
001)
Levothyroxine
treatment
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
of
both
TC
and
LDLc
concentrations
(P
=
0003)
in
direct
proportion
to
the
respective
baseline
values
(P
<
005
and
P
<
001
respectively)
whereas
no
change
in
Lp(a)
level
was
observed
No
changes
occurred
in
the
placebo
group
In
conclusion
only
serum
LDLc
levels
are
increased
specifically
and
reversibly
in
association
with
SCH
Altered
Lp(a)
values
reflect
a
genetic
influence
rather
than
a
reduced
thyroid
hormone
action
