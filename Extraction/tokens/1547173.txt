Randomized
trial
of
amniotomy
in
labour
versus
the
intention
to
leave
membranes
intact
until
the
second
stage
Abstract
Text
To
compare
by
randomized
prospective
clinical
trial
the
outcome
of
labours
which
are
managed
with
the
intention
to
leave
the
membranes
intact
compared
with
the
practice
of
elective
artificial
rupture
of
the
membranes
(ARM)
in
early
established
labour
Prospective
randomized
controlled
trial
of
low
risk
women
admitted
in
spontaneous
labour
with
intact
membranes
The
labour
ward
of
St
James's
University
Hospital
Leeds
UK

362
women
in
spontaneous
labour
with
intact
membranes
and
no
evidence
of
fetal
distress
between
37
and
42
weeks
gestation
During
the
course
of
the
trial
it
was
found
that
some
randomization
cards
could
not
be
accounted
for
and
a
system
of
daily
checks
was
instituted
The
results
were
analysed
for
all
recorded
women
(n
=
362)
and
after
institution
of
the
more
rigorous
system
(n
=
120)
The
duration
of
each
phase
of
labour
epidural
rate
prevalence
of
an
abnormal
cardiotocograph
(CTG)
(assessed
blind)
method
of
delivery
and
neonatal
outcome
178
of
the
183
women
(97%)
in
the
ARM
group
had
their
membranes
ruptured
in
early
labour
and
83
(46%)
of
the
179
women
allocated
to
non-intervention
had
ARM
performed
at
some
stage
A
significant
decrease
in
the
duration
of
labour
(mean
83
SD
41
h
vs
mean
97
SD
48
h
n
=
156
P
=
005)
was
found
amongst
primigravidae
allocated
to
ARM
when
compared
with
non
intervention
The
duration
of
the
second
stage
of
labour
was
unaffected
In
the
ARM
group
the
epidural
rate
was
higher
and
labour
was
more
often
complicated
by
CTG
abnormalities
There
were
no
differences
in
the
method
of
delivery
fetal
condition
at
birth
(cord
blood
lactate
Apgar
score)
or
postpartum
pyrexia
between
the
ARM
and
non-intervention
groups
The
same
trends
were
observed
when
analysis
was
confined
to
women
entered
into
the
trial
after
the
system
of
rigour
was
instituted
Routine
ARM
results
in
labour
that
is
slightly
shorter
than
if
the
membranes
are
allowed
to
rupture
spontaneously
but
more
epidurals
are
used
suggesting
that
labour
is
more
painful
There
are
fewer
fetal
heart
rate
abnormalities
if
the
membranes
are
left
intact
but
amniotomy
has
no
effect
on
fetal
condition
at
birth
