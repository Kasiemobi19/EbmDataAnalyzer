Abstract
Text
Description
of
the
natural
course
of
otitis
media
with
effusion
(OME)
in
pre-school
children
Longitudinal
follow-up
study
Nijmegen
the
Netherlands
at
the
children's
home
address
A
cohort
of
1439
children
born
in
the
period
September
1982
to
August
1983
and
living
in
Nijmegen
at
their
second
birthday
were
invited
for
participation
in
serial
tympanometric
screening
with
a
three-monthly
interval
Each
child
was
measured
9
times
from
age
24
to
48
months
A
flat
tympanogram
was
considered
to
be
indicative
of
OME
Participation
was
92%
but
interpretable
tympanograms
were
taken
in
2242
ears
(first
round)
to
1990
ears
(last
screening)
Data
of
56
children
treated
with
grommets
were
excluded
from
analysis
Longstanding
OME
(at
least
4
flat
tympanograms
in
a
succession)
was
seen
in
93%
(95%-CI
70-116)
of
ears
In
another
234%
(201-268)
of
ears
OME
was
found
2
or
3
times
at
subsequent
screenings
Single
or
recurrent
flat
tympanograms
were
seen
in
204%
(172-236)
and
116%
(90-141)
of
the
ears
respectively
The
probability
of
recovery
over
time
was
well
described
with
a
simple
function
of
a
50%
improvement
every
3
months
In
addition
50%
of
the
recovered
ears
showed
one
or
more
recurrences
of
OME
OME
appears
to
run
a
very
fluctuating
course
with
a
strong
representation
of
short
disease
episodes
and
high
rates
of
recovery
and
remission
The
data
confirm
the
results
of
others
A
common
interpretation
ie
a
sharp
reduction
of
the
recovery
rate
after
three
months
appears
to
be
false
A
50%
improvement
rate
every
3
months
fits
the
data
equally
well
This
study
does
not
provide
information
about
the
sequelae
of
OME
at
school
age
