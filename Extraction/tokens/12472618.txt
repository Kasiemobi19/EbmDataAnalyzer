Optimum
usage
of
prilocaine-lidocaine
cream
in
premature
ejaculation
Abstract
Text
Premature
ejaculation
is
a
common
male
sexual
disorder
in
which
orgasm
and
ejaculation
occur
before
the
desired
moment
The
primary
therapeutic
approach
to
premature
ejaculation
has
been
behavioural
and
pharmacotherapy
In
this
study
we
evaluated
the
efficacy
and
optimum
usage
of
lidocaine-prilocaine
cream
5%
in
preventing
premature
ejaculation
Forty
patients
were
examined
in
the
study
group
and
randomized
into
four
groups
each
comprising
10
patients
Patients
in
group
1
applied
lidocaine-prilocaine
cream
5%
for
20
min
the
patients
in
group
2
applied
it
for
30
min
and
the
patients
in
group
3
applied
the
cream
for
45
min
before
sexual
contact
with
all
patients
covering
the
penis
with
a
condom
Patients
in
the
fourth
group
applied
a
base
cream
as
placebo
In
group
1
the
pre-ejaculation
period
increased
to
671
+/-
254
min
without
any
adverse
effects
In
group
2
although
the
pre-ejaculation
period
increased
in
four
patients
up
to
870
+/-
170
min
six
patients
in
this
group
and
all
patients
in
group
3
had
erection
loss
because
of
numbness
In
the
placebo
group
there
was
no
change
in
their
pre-ejaculation
period
Therefore
lidocaine-prilocaine
cream
5%
is
effective
in
premature
ejaculation
and
20
min
of
application
time
before
sexual
contact
is
the
optimum
period
