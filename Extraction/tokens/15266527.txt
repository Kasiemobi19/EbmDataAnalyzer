Abstract
Text
Use
of
smokeless
tobacco
(ST)
can
lead
to
nicotine
addiction
and
health
problems
including
periodontal
disease
and
oral
cancer

To
assess
the
effects
of
behavioural
and
pharmacotherapeutic
interventions
to
treat
ST
use
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Tobacco
Addiction
Group
trials
register

Randomized
trials
of
behavioural
or
pharmacological
interventions
to
help
users
of
ST
to
quit
with
follow-up
of
at
least
six
months
Two
authors
independently
extracted
data
One
trial
of
bupropion
did
not
detect
a
benefit
of
treatment
after
six
months
(Odds
Ratio
(OR)

95%
Confidence
Interval
(CI)

to

Three
trials
of
nicotine
patch
did
not
detect
a
benefit
(OR

95%

088
to
154)
nor
did
two
trials
of
nicotine
gum
(OR

059
to
163)
There
was
statistical
heterogeneity
among
the
results
of
eight
trials
of
behavioural
interventions
included
in
the
meta-analysis
Three
trials
showed
significant
benefits
of
intervention
In
a
post-hoc
analysis
the
trials
of
interventions
which
included
an
oral
examination
and
feedback
about
ST-induced
mucosal
changes
had
homogeneous
results
and
when
pooled
showed
a
significant
benefit
(OR
241
95%
CI
179
to
324)
Behavioural
interventions
should
be
used
to
help
ST
users
to
quit
Pharmacotherapies
have
not
been
shown
to
affect
long-term
abstinence
but
larger
trials
are
needed
