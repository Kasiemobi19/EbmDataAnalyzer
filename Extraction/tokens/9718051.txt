Abstract
Text
Observational
studies
have
found
lower
rates
of
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
in
postmenopausal
women
who
take
estrogen
than
in
women
who
do
not
but
this
potential
benefit
has
not
been
confirmed
in
clinical
trials
To
determine
if
estrogen
plus
progestin
therapy
alters
the
risk
for
CHD
events
in
postmenopausal
women
with
established
coronary
disease
Randomized
blinded
placebo-controlled
secondary
prevention
trial
Outpatient
and
community
settings
at
20
US
clinical
centers
A
total
of
2763
women
with
coronary
disease
younger
than
80
years
and
postmenopausal
with
an
intact
uterus
Mean
age
was
667
years
Either
0625
mg
of
conjugated
equine
estrogens
plus
25
mg
of
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
in
1
tablet
daily
(n
=
1380)
or
a
placebo
of
identical
appearance
(n
=
1383)
Follow-up
averaged
41
years
82%
of
those
assigned
to
hormone
treatment
were
taking
it
at
the
end
of
1
year
and
75%
at
the
end
of
3
years
The
primary
outcome
was
the
occurrence
of
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
(MI)
or
CHD
death
Secondary
cardiovascular
outcomes
included
coronary
revascularization
unstable
angina
congestive
heart
failure
resuscitated
cardiac
arrest
stroke
or
transient
ischemic
attack
and
peripheral
arterial
disease
All-cause
mortality
was
also
considered
Overall
there
were
no
significant
differences
between
groups
in
the
primary
outcome
or
in
any
of
the
secondary
cardiovascular
outcomes
172
women
in
the
hormone
group
and
176
women
in
the
placebo
group
had
MI
or
CHD
death
(relative
hazard
[RH]
099
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
080-122)
The
lack
of
an
overall
effect
occurred
despite
a
net
11%
lower
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
level
and
10%
higher
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
level
in
the
hormone
group
compared
with
the
placebo
group
(each
P<001)
Within
the
overall
null
effect
there
was
a
statistically
significant
time
trend
with
more
CHD
events
in
the
hormone
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
in
year
1
and
fewer
in
years
4
and
5
More
women
in
the
hormone
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
experienced
venous
thromboembolic
events
(34
vs
12
RH
289
95%
CI
150-558)
and
gallbladder
disease
(84
vs
62
RH
138
95%
CI
100-192)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
several
other
end
points
for
which
power
was
limited
including
fracture
cancer
and
total
mortality
(131
vs
123
deaths
RH
108
95%
CI
084-138)
During
an
average
follow-up
of
41
years
treatment
with
oral
conjugated
equine
estrogen
plus
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
did
not
reduce
the
overall
rate
of
CHD
events
in
postmenopausal
women
with
established
coronary
disease
The
treatment
did
increase
the
rate
of
thromboembolic
events
and
gallbladder
disease
Based
on
the
finding
of
no
overall
cardiovascular
benefit
and
a
pattern
of
early
increase
in
risk
of
CHD
events
we
do
not
recommend
starting
this
treatment
for
the
purpose
of
secondary
prevention
of
CHD
However
given
the
favorable
pattern
of
CHD
events
after
several
years
of
therapy
it
could
be
appropriate
for
women
already
receiving
this
treatment
to
continue
