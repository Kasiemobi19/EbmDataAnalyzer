Abstract
Text
Miconazole
gel
has
previously
been
shown
to
be
an
effective
treatment
for
oropharyngeal
candidiasis
(thrush)
in
immunocompetent
infants
This
study
compares
miconazole
gel
with
the
standard
therapeutic
agent
nystatin
suspension
with
regard
to
efficacy
optimal
duration
of
therapy
and
safety
Prospective
multicenter
randomized
office-based
open
trial
Twenty-six
pediatricians
enrolled
227
immunocompetent
infants
with
signs
of
oropharyngeal
thrush
Subjects
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
25
mg
of
miconazole
as
oral
gel
four
times
daily
or
100000
IU
of
nystatin
as
suspension
four
times
daily
after
meals
All
subjects
were
evaluated
for
safety
Fifteen
patients
whose
thrush
was
not
confirmed
by
culture
were
excluded
from
further
analysis
The
remaining
212
subjects
were
entered
into
an
intention-to-treat
analysis
Another
29
patients
violated
the
study
protocol
the
remaining
183
subjects
were
evaluated
for
efficacy
(per
protocol
analysis)
Clinical
cure
by
Day
5
of
treatment
was
demonstrated
in
847%
of
the
98
subjects
in
the
miconazole
group
and
212%
of
the
85
subjects
in
the
nystatin
group
(P
<
00001)
By
Day
8
the
cumulative
clinical
cure
rates
were
969%
(miconazole)
and
376%
(nystatin)
respectively
(P
<
00001)
By
Day
12990%
of
subjects
in
the
miconazole
group
and
541%
of
subjects
in
the
nystatin
group
were
clinically
cured
(P
<
00001)
Premature
cessation
of
treatment
at
parents'
request
because
of
lack
of
clinical
efficacy
occurred
in
none
of
the
infants
treated
with
miconazole
and
in
6
infants
treated
with
nystatin
(P
=
0029)
The
oral
yeast
eradication
rate
on
Day
5
was
541%
with
miconazole
and
82%
with
nystatin
(P
<
00001)
Clinical
relapses
of
oropharyngeal
thrush
and
side
effects
of
the
study
drugs
were
observed
with
similar
frequency
in
both
study
arms
Miconazole
gel
was
significantly
superior
to
nystatin
suspension
with
regard
to
efficacy
rapidity
of
achieving
cure
and
oropharyngeal
yeast
eradication
Relapses
and
side
effects
did
not
occur
more
frequently
with
miconazole
than
with
nystatin
The
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
miconazole
gel
is
superior
to
nystatin
suspension
as
the
treatment
for
oropharyngeal
candidiasis
in
immunocompetent
infants
