The
rational
clinical
examination
Is
this
patient
having
a
myocardial
infarction
Abstract
Text
When
faced
with
a
patient
with
acute
chest
pain
clinicians
must
distinguish
myocardial
infarction
(MI)
from
all
other
causes
of
acute
chest
pain
If
MI
is
suspected
current
therapeutic
practice
includes
deciding
whether
to
administer
thrombolysis
or
primary
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
and
whether
to
admit
patients
to
a
coronary
care
unit
The
former
decision
is
based
on
electrocardiographic
(ECG)
changes
including
ST-segment
elevation
or
left
bundle-branch
block
the
latter
on
the
likelihood
of
the
patient's
having
unstable
high-risk
ischemia
or
MI
without
ECG
changes
Despite
advances
in
investigative
modalities
a
focused
history
and
physical
examination
followed
by
an
ECG
remain
the
key
tools
for
the
diagnosis
of
MI
The
most
powerful
features
that
increase
the
probability
of
MI
and
their
associated
likelihood
ratios
(LRs)
are
new
ST-segment
elevation
(LR
range
57-539)
new
Q
wave
(LR
range
53-248)
chest
pain
radiating
to
both
the
left
and
right
arm
simultaneously
(LR
71)
presence
of
a
third
heart
sound
(LR
32)
and
hypotension
(LR
31)
The
most
powerful
features
that
decrease
the
probability
of
MI
are
a
normal
ECG
result
(LR
range
01-03)
pleuritic
chest
pain
(LR
02)
chest
pain
reproduced
by
palpation
(LR
range
02-04)
sharp
or
stabbing
chest
pain
(LR
03)
and
positional
chest
pain
(LR
03)
Computer-derived
algorithms
that
depend
on
clinical
examination
and
ECG
findings
might
improve
the
classification
of
patients
according
to
the
probability
that
an
MI
is
causing
their
chest
pain
