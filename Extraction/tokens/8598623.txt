Effectiveness
of
vaginal
Papanicolaou
smear
screening
after
total
hysterectomy
for
benign
disease
Abstract
Text
Using
literature
review
we
assessed
(1)
Papanicolaou
smear
screening
recommendations
after
hysterectomy
for
benign
disease
(2)
total
hysterectomy
for
benign
disease
as
a
risk
for
vaginal
dysplasia
or
carcinoma
and
(3)
effectiveness
of
screening
for
vaginal
carcinoma
after
total
hysterectomy
for
benign
disease
We
considered
(1)
organizations'
recommendations
about
screening
(2)
references
from
major
textbooks
of
gynecology
and
(3)
MEDLINE
searches
of
English-language
studies
published
from
1966
through
1995
using
the
search
strategy
(hysterectomy
and
vaginal
smears)
or
(vaginal
smears
and
vaginal
neoplasms)
Published
or
verbal
confirmations
of
screening
recommendations
were
eligible
Criteria
for
assessing
risk
of
vaginal
dysplasia
or
carcinoma
included
original
research
documented
reports
of
hysterectomy
as
an
exposure
and
evidence
of
preinvasive
vaginal
disease
or
vaginal
carcinoma
outcomes
We
sought
data
assessing
burden
of
suffering
screening
efficacy
and
effectiveness
of
early
detection
Descriptive
and
analytic
data
from
each
study
were
abstracted
Screening
recommendations
were
categorized
by
the
organizations'
positions
two
opposed
screening
two
supported
screening
and
six
lacked
specific
guidelines
Data
on
the
risk
between
total
hysterectomy
for
benign
disease
and
subsequent
vaginal
carcinoma
were
organized
by
study
design
(three
case
control
two
cohort
and
13
case
series)
and
described
Data
on
screening
effectiveness
were
organized
to
address
the
criteria
advocated
by
the
US
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
There
are
conflicting
guidelines
on
screening
after
hysterectomy
and
conflicting
data
on
the
risk
of
vaginal
carcinoma
after
total
hysterectomy
for
benign
disease
though
the
best-designed
research
suggests
no
association
There
is
insufficient
evidence
to
recommend
routine
vaginal
smear
screening
in
women
after
total
hysterectomy
for
benign
disease
