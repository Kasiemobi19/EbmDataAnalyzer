Title
Infant
self-regulation
of
breast
milk
intake
Abstract
Text
In
an
experimental
study
to
determine
whether
augmentation
of
maternal
milk
supply
affects
infant
intake
18
mothers
of
exclusively
breast-fed
infants
stimulated
milk
supply
by
daily
expression
of
extra
milk
for
2
weeks
Infant
milk
intake
was
recorded
before
during
and
after
this
expression
phase
All
but
4
mothers
increased
milk
production
by
greater
than
73
g/day
over
baseline
with
an
average
increase
of
124
g/day
On
the
average
the
14
infants
of
mothers
who
increased
milk
production
took
in
significantly
more
milk
immediately
following
the
expression
phase
(849
vs
732
g/day)
but
about
half
of
them
returned
to
near
baseline
levels
of
milk
intake
after
1-2
weeks
Net
change
in
infant
intake
at
the
end
of
the
study
was
positively
correlated
with
infant
weight-for-length
(r
=
059)
and
age
(r
=
058)
and
was
unrelated
to
baseline
milk
intake
(r
=
-006)
Therefore
the
wide
range
in
breast
milk
volume
in
well-nourished
populations
is
due
more
to
variation
in
infant
"demand"
than
to
inadequacy
of
milk
production
