Abstract
Text
Initial
treatment
of
major
depressive
disorder
in
adolescents
may
include
cognitive-behavioral
therapy
(CBT)
or
a
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
(SSRI)
However
little
is
known
about
their
relative
or
combined
effectiveness
To
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
4
treatments
among
adolescents
with
major
depressive
disorder
Randomized
controlled
trial
of
a
volunteer
sample
of
439
patients
between
the
ages
of
12
to
17
years

The

at

clinics
between

and

Twelve

of
(1)
fluoxetine

(10

40
mg/d)
(2)
CBT

(3)
CBT
with
fluoxetine
(10
to

or
(4)
placebo
(equivalent
to
10

40
mg/d)
Placebo
and
fluoxetine

Compared

the

was
statistically

Fluoxetine

The
