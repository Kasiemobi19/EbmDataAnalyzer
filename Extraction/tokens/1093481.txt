Title
Miconazole
therapy
for
endemic
fungal
disease
Abstract
Text
Miconazole
nitrate
(20%)
cream
was
evaluated
in
the
treatment
of
endemic
dermatophytosis
in
an
overcrowded
prison
The
active
drug
was
compared
in
a
random
double-blind
study
with
its
control
vehicle
in
the
treatment
of
99
inmates
who
had
moderate
to
severe
symptomatic
disease
Tinea
cruris
and
tinea
pedis
caused
by
Trichophyton
rubrum
predominated
although
Trichophyton
mentagrophytes
and
Candida
albicans
were
also
isolated
and
identified
Prompt
clinical
clearing
occurred
in
755%
of
those
treated
with
miconazole
versus
120%
of
those
treated
with
the
vehicle
alone
Results
of
mycological
examination
closely
paralleled
and
confirmed
these
clinical
results
