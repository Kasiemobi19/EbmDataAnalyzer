Title
Hepatitis
and
hematemesis
complicating
nicotinic
acid
use
Abstract
Text
Nicotinic
acid
has
a
proven
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
hypercholesterolemia
Therapeutic
use
of
this
water-soluble
B
vitamin
has
resulted
in
a
survival
benefit
among
patients
enrolled
in
the
Coronary
Drug
Project
Conversely
nicotinic
acid
has
been
associated
with
a
high
side-effect
profile
when
used
at
therapeutic
doses
Nevertheless
there
are
no
previously
reported
cases
of
hematemesis
temporally
associated
with
nicotinic
acid
use
The
authors
report
the
case
of
a
previously
healthy
20-year-old
man
who
developed
hematemesis
and
hepatitis
1
week
after
self-initiating
the
daily
consumption
of
6
g
of
nicotinic
acid
Supportive
therapy
and
discontinuing
nicotinic
acid
resulted
in
rapid
clinical
improvement
in
this
patient
The
clinical
circumstances
suggest
a
possible
causal
relationship
between
nicotinic
acid
consumption
and
his
presenting
problems
The
use
of
large
doses
of
nicotinic
acid
may
be
rapidly
complicated
by
hematemesis
and
hepatitis
