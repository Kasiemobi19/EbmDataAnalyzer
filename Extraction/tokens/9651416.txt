Abstract
Text
To
compare
historical
features
physical
examination
findings
and
testicular
color
Doppler
ultrasound
in
pediatric
patients
with
epididymitis
testicular
torsion
and
torsion
of
appendix
testis
A
retrospective
review
of
patients
with
the
diagnosis
of
epididymitis
testicular
torsion
or
torsion
of
appendix
testis
Ninety
patients
were
included
in
the
study
(64
with
epididymitis
13
with
testicular
torsion
and
13
with
torsion
of
appendix
testis)
Historical
features
did
not
differ
among
groups
except
for
duration
of
symptoms
Of
13
patients
with
testicular
torsion
all
had
a
tender
testicle
and
an
absent
cremasteric
reflex
When
compared
with
the
testicular
torsion
group
fewer
patients
with
epididymitis
had
a
tender
testicle
(69%)
or
an
absent
cremasteric
reflex
(14%)
62
(97%)
patients
with
epididymitis
had
a
tender
epididymis
and
43
(67%)
had
scrotal
erythema/edema
By
comparison
3
(23%)
and
5
(38%)
patients
with
testicular
torsion
had
a
tender
epididymis
or
scrotal
erythema/edema
respectively
Doppler
ultrasound
showed
decreased
or
absent
blood
flow
in
8
patients
7
of
whom
were
diagnosed
with
testicular
torsion
Ten
out
of
13
patients
with
testicular
torsion
had
a
salvageable
testicle
at
the
time
of
surgery
The
physical
examination
is
helpful
in
distinguishing
among
epididymitis
testicular
torsion
and
torsion
of
appendix
testis
Patients
presenting
with
a
tender
testicle
and
an
absent
cremasteric
reflex
were
more
likely
to
have
a
testicular
torsion
rather
than
epididymitis
or
torsion
of
appendix
testis
An
absent
cremasteric
reflex
was
the
most
sensitive
physical
finding
for
diagnosing
testicular
torsion
Color
Doppler
ultrasound
is
a
useful
adjunct
in
the
evaluation
of
the
acute
scrotum
when
physical
findings
are
equivocal
