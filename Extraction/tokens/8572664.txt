Impact
of
deprenyl
and
tocopherol
treatment
on
Parkinson's
disease
in
DATATOP
patients
requiring
levodopa
Parkinson
Study
Group
Abstract
Text
The
Deprenyl
and
Tocopherol
Antioxidant
Therapy
of
Parkinsonism
(DATATOP)
trial
was
designed
to
test
outcomes
from
treatment
with
10
mg
of
deprenyl
and/or
2000
mg
of
tocopherol/day
in
800
untreated
patients
with
Parkinson's
disease
The
need
of
subjects
for
symptomatic
treatment
with
levodopa
and
the
conversion
of
all
subjects
to
open-label
deprenyl
made
it
possible
to
study
the
long-term
effect
of
early
deprenyl
and
tocopherol
treatment
on
the
later
development
of
levodopa-associated
side
effects
The
rate
of
developing
these
side
effects
did
not
differ
among
the
original
treatment
groups
(early
versus
late
deprenyl
and
tocopherol
versus
nontocopherol)
About
50%
of
subjects
developed
"wearing
off"
30%
dyskinesias
and
25%
"freezing"
in
each
group
At
the
end
of
the
study
the
groups
were
similarly
disabled
on
the
Hoehn-Yahr
Schwab-England
and
Unified
Parkinson's
Disease
Rating
scales
and
took
similar
amounts
of
levodopa
Young
subjects
were
more
likely
to
develop
wearing
off
women
to
develop
dyskinesias
and
older
subjects
with
rapidly
progressive
disease
to
develop
freezing
We
conclude
that
prior
treatment
with
deprenyl
or
tocopherol
did
not
reduce
the
occurrence
of
subsequent
levodopa-associated
adverse
effects
in
this
population
