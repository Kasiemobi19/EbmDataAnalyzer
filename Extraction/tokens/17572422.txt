perimenopause
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
effects
of
low-dose
hormone
therapy
(LD-HT)
on
bleeding
pattern
and
vasomotor
symptoms
in
perimenopausal
women
In
a
prospective
open-label
study
at
an
University
clinic
120
perimenopausal
women
suffering
from
irregular
menstrual
cycles
and
hot
flushes
were
randomized
to
micronized
17beta-estradiol
1
mg
plus
dydrogesterone
10
mg
sequential
added
(LD-HT
group
A
60
subjects)
or
dydrogesterone
10
mg
from
day
15
to
28
(group
B
60
subjects)
Number
and
severity
of
hot
flushes
and
bleeding
pattern
were
assessed
throughout
the
study
Women
in
group
A
experienced
a
significant
reduction
in
number
of
hot
flushes
while
no
significant
variation
was
observed
in
group
B
The
incidence
of
cyclic
bleeding
was
86%
in
group
A
and
76%
in
group
B
the
mean
duration
was
significantly
lower
in
group
A
than
in
group
B

LD-HT
may
control
both
irregular
bleeding
and
hot
flushes
in
perimenopausal
women
