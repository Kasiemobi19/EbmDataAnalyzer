Title
The
safety
of
omeprazole
during
pregnancy
a
multicenter
prospective
controlled
study
Abstract
Text
Our
purpose
was
to
determine
whether
omeprazole
use
during
pregnancy
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
malformations
spontaneous
abortions
decreased
birth
weight
or
perinatal
complications
In
a
multicenter
prospective
controlled
study
pregnant
women
exposed
to
omeprazole
during
gestation
were
matched
with
controls
exposed
to
nonteratogens
and
with
disease-paired
controls
who
used
histamine
blockers
for
similar
indications
The
primary
end
point
was
the
incidence
of
major
malformations
One
hundred
thirteen
pregnant
women
were
exposed
to
omeprazole
during
pregnancy
Rates
of
major
malformations
in
the
omeprazole
group
(4%)
did
not
differ
from
controls
exposed
to
nonteratogens
(2%)
(P

relative
risk
=

95%
confidence
interval
036
to
1036)
and
disease-paired
controls
(28%)
Birth
weight
gestational
age
at
delivery
preterm
deliveries
and
neonatal
complications
were
comparable
among
the
three
groups
No
association
was
found
between
exposure
to
omeprazole
during
the
period
of
organogenesis
and
increased
risk
for
major
malformations
Exposure
throughout
pregnancy
is
not
associated
with
increased
risk
of
spontaneous
abortions
decreased
birth
weight
or
perinatal
complications
