Abstract
Text
To
report
the
outcome
of
surgery
for
chronic
recalcitrant
Achilles
tendinopathy
in
nonathletic
and
athletic
subjects
Case-control
study
University
teaching
hospitals
We
matched
each
of
the
61
nonathletic
patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
tendinopathy
of
the
Achilles
tendon
with
an
athletic
patient
with
tendinopathy
of
the
main
body
of
the
Achilles
tendon
of
the
same
sex
and
age
(+/-2
years)
A
match
was
possible
for
56
patients
(23
males
and
33
females)
Forty-eight
nonathletic
subjects
and
45
athletic
subjects
agreed
to
participate
Open

for
Achilles
tendinopathy
Outcome
of

sport
complication
rate
Nonathletic
patients
were
shorter
and
heavier
than
athletic
patients
They
had
greater
body
mass
index
calf
circumference
side-to-side
calf
circumference
differences
and
subcutaneous
body
fat
than
athletic
patients
Of
the
48
nonathletic
patients
9
underwent
further
surgery
during
the
study
period
and
only
25
reported
an
excellent
or
good
result
Of
the
45
athletic
subjects
4
underwent
further
surgery
during
the
study
period
and
36
reported
an

The
remaining
patients
could
not
return
to
their
normal

of
activity
In
all
of
them

Nonathletic

experience
more
prolonged
recovery
more
complications
and
a
greater
risk
of
further
surgery
than
athletic

with
recalcitrant
Achilles
