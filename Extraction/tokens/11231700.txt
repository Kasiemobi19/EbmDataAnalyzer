Effects

Abstract
Text
Few
trials
have
evaluated
the
effects
of
reduced
sodium
intake
in
older
individuals
and
no
trial
has
examined
the
effects
in
relevant
subgroups
such
as
African
Americans
The
effects
of
sodium
reduction
on
blood
pressure
(BP)
and
hypertension
control
were
evaluated
in
681
patients
with
hypertension
aged
60
to
80
years
randomly
assigned
to
a
reduced
sodium
intervention
or
control
group
Participants
(47%
women
23%
African
Americans)
had
systolic
BP
less
than
145
mm
Hg
and
diastolic
BP
less
than
85
mm
Hg
while
taking
1
antihypertensive
medication
Three
months
after
the
start
of
intervention
medication
was
withdrawn
The
primary
end
point
was
occurrence
of
an
average
systolic
BP
of
150
mm
Hg
or
more
an
average
diastolic
BP
of
90
mm
Hg
or
more
the
resumption
of
medication
or
a
cardiovascular
event
during
follow-up
(mean
278
months)
Compared
with
control
mean
urinary
sodium
excretion
was
40
mmol/d
less
in
the
reduced
sodium
intervention
group
(P<001)
significant
reductions
in
sodium
excretion
occurred
in
subgroups
defined
by
sex
race
age
and
obesity
Prior
to
medication
withdrawal
mean
reductions
in
systolic
and
diastolic
BPs
from
the
reduced
sodium
intervention
net
of
control
were
43
mm
Hg
(P<001)
and
20
mm
Hg
(P
=001)
During
follow-up
an
end
point
occurred
in
59%
of
reduced
sodium
and
73%
of
control
group
participants
(relative
hazard
ratio
=
068
P<001)
In
African
Americans
the
corresponding
relative
hazard
ratio
was
056
(P
=005)
results
were
similar
in
other
subgroups
In
dose-response
analyses
end
points
were
progressively
less
frequent
with
greater
sodium
reduction
(P
for
trend
=002)
A
reduced
sodium
intake
is
a
broadly
effective
nonpharmacologic
therapy
that
can
lower
BP
and
control
hypertension
in
older
individuals
