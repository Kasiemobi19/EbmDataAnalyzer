Failure
to
thrive
still
a
problem
of
definition
Abstract
Text
The
term
'failure
to
thrive'
(FTT)
is
widely
used
to
describe
inadequate
growth
in
early
childhood
However
no
consensus
exists
concerning
the
specific
anthropometrical
criteria
to
define
this
description
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
make
an
updated
assessment
concerning
the
use
of
FTT
definitions
and
describe
possible
trends
regarding
the
use
of
specific
criteria
A
cross-sectional
review
was
done
covering
English-language
articles
published
from
January
2003
until
June
2004
and
recent
textbooks
of
general
pediatrics
Most
of
the
reviewed
literature
broadly
defined
FTT
as
inadequate
growth
and
total
agreement
existed
to
define
FTT
based
solely
on
anthropometrical
parameters
Large
differences
however
were
seen
regarding
which
growth
parameters
to
use
and
whether
to
use
attained
values
or
velocities
Weight
was
the
most
predominant
choice
but
many
included
more
than
one
anthropometrical
parameter
Failure
to
thrive
in
children
is
currently
described
solely
based
on
anthropometrical
indicators
with
weight
gain
as
the
predominant
choice
of
indicator
and
cut
off
around
the
5th
percentile
Discussion
is
needed
as
to
whether
the
term
'failure
to
thrive'
is
still
a
useful
common
term
for
pediatric
undernutrition
of
different
types
