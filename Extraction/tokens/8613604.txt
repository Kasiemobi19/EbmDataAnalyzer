Title
Meta-analysis
of
intravenous
dipyridamole-thallium-201
imaging
(1985
to
1994)
and
dobutamine
echocardiography
(1991
to
1994)
for
risk
stratification
before
vascular
surgery
Abstract
Text
This
study
evaluated
the
prognostic
value
of
abnormal
test
results
with
pharmacologic
stress
with
regard
to
perioperative
and
long-term
outcomes
in
a
large
population
of
candidates
for
vascular
surgery
Although
numerous
studies
have
demonstrated
the
prognostic
value
of
dipyridamole-thallium-201
myocardial
perfusion
and
dobutamine
echocardiography
in
vascular
surgery
candidates
a
synopsis
of
predictive
estimates
is
difficult
because
of
individual
study
variability
in
pretest
clinical
risk
sample
size
and
study
design
A
systematic
review
of
published
reports
on
preoperative
pharmacologic
stress
risk
stratification
from
the
MEDLINE
data
base
(1985
to
1994)
identified
10
reports
on
dipyridamole-thallium-201
myocardial
perfusion
(1994
patients)
and
5
on
dobutamine
stress
echocardiography
(446
patients)
Random
effects
models
were
used
to
calculate
summary
odds
ratios
and
95%
confidence
intervals
Summary
odds
ratios
for
death
or
myocardial
infarction
and
secondary
cardiac
end
points
were
greater
for
dobutamine
echocardiographic
dyssynergy
(14-
to
27-fold)
than
for
dipyridamole-thallium-201
redistribution
(4-fold)
wider
confidence
intervals
were
noted
with
dobutamine
echocardiography
Pretest
coronary
disease
probability
was
correlated
with
the
positive
predictive
value
of
a
reversible
thallium-201
defect
(r=070)
increasing
sixfold
from
low
to
high
risk
patient
subsets
Cardiac
event
rates
were
low
in
patients
without
a
history
of
coronary
artery
disease
(1%
in
176
patients)
compared
with
patients
with
coronary
disease
and
a
normal
or
fixed-defect
pattern
(48%
in
83
patients)
and
one
or
more
thallium-201
redistribution
abnormality
(186%
in
97
patients
p=00001)
Meta-analysis
of
15
studies
demonstrated
that
the
prognostic
value
of
noninvasive
stress
imaging
abnormalities
for
perioperative
ischemic
events
is
comparable
between
available
techniques
but
that
the
accuracy
varies
with
coronary
artery
disease
prevalence
