Preconception
care
and
the
risk
of
congenital
anomalies
in
the
offspring
of
women
with
diabetes

a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Offspring
of
women
with
pregestational
diabetes
mellitus
are
at
increased
risk
for
congenital
malformations
largely
attributable
to
poor
periconceptional
glycaemic
control
We
assessed
the
effect
of
preconception
care
in
reducing
congenital
malformations
in
a
meta-analysis
of
published
studies
of
preconception
care
in
women
with
diabetes
mellitus
Articles
were
retrieved
from
Medline
(1970
to
June
2000)
and
Embase
(1980
to
June
2000)
and
data
abstracted
by
two
independent
reviewers
The
rates
and
relative
risks
(RR)
for
major
and
minor
congenital
malformations
were
pooled
from
all
eligible
studies
using
a
random
effects
model
as
were
early
first-trimester
glycosylated
haemoglobin
values
In
14
cohort
studies
major
congenital
malformations
were
assessed
among
1192
offspring
of
mothers
who
had
received
preconception
care
and
1459
offspring
of
women
who
had
not
The
pooled
rate
of
major
anomalies
was
lower
among
preconception
care
recipients
(21%)
than
non-recipients
(65%)
(RR
036
95%CI
022-059)
In
nine
studies
the
risk
for
major
and
minor
anomalies
was
also
lower
among
women
who
received
preconception
care
(RR
032
95%CI
017-059)
as
were
the
early
first-trimester
mean
glycosylated
haemoglobin
values
(pooled
mean
difference
23%
95%CI
21-24)
Women
who
received
preconception
care
were
on
average
18
years
older
than
non-recipients
and
fewer
smoked
(196%
vs
302%)
Only
one
study
described
the
routine
use
of
periconception
folic
acid
Out-patient
preconception
care
probably
reduces
the
risk
of
major
congenital
anomalies
among
the
offspring
of
women
with
pregestational
diabetes
mellitus
Because
many
women
with
diabetes
neither
plan
their
pregnancy
nor
achieve
adequate
glycaemic
control
before
conception
strategies
are
needed
to
improve
access
to
these
programs
and
to
maximize
those
interventions
associated
with
improved
pregnancy
outcome
such
as
smoking
cessation
and
folic
acid
use
