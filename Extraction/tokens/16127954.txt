Title
Cutaneous
warts
an
evidence-based
approach
to
therapy
Abstract
Text
Cutaneous
warts
are
a
common
presenting
complaint
in
children
and
adolescents
Common
plantar
or
flat
warts
are
cutaneous
manifestations
of
the
human
papillomavirus
The
treatment
of
warts
poses
a
therapeutic
challenge
for
physicians
No
single
therapy
has
been
proven
effective
at
achieving
complete
remission
in
every
patient
As
a
result
many
different
approaches
to
wart
therapy
exist
These
approaches
are
discussed
to
demonstrate
the
evidence
supporting
common
therapies
and
provide
a
guideline
for
physicians
Evidence
supports
the
at-home
use
of
topical
salicylic
acid
and
physician-administered
cryotherapy
Intralesional
immunotherapy
for
nongenital
cutaneous
warts
may
be
an
option
for
large
or
recalcitrant
warts
