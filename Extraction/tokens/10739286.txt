Abstract
Text
Serial
casting
to
stretch
the
plantar-flexors
has
been
advocated
for
idiopathic
toe-walkers
(ITW)
and
children
with
spastic
cerebral
palsy
(CP)
although
outcomes
have
not
been
well
studied
Neuromuscular
function
and
gait
were
examined
in
eight
children
with
CP
(mean
age
71
years)
and
eight
ITW
(mean
age
75
years)
casted
for
3
to
6
weeks
Baseline
comparisons
indicated
that
children
with
CP
produced
lower
isometric
plantar-flexor
torques
(p<002)
concomitant
with
marked
co-contraction
(p<0001)
greater
ankle
mobility
(p<002)
and
higher
reflex
excitability
(p<0001)
than
ITW
After
casting
both
groups
increased
dorsiflexion
range
(p<0001)
decreased
resistance
to
passive
stretch
(p<0005)
and
produced
maximal
plantar-flexor
torques
in
dorsiflexed
positions
(p<0001)
Reflex
excitability
was
reduced
in
CP
(p<005)
Immediately
postcasting
no
children
toe-walked
but
two
with
CP
resumed
a
digitigrade
pattern
6
weeks
later
Gait
velocity
and
stride
length
did
not
change
(p>005)
Serial
casting
yielded
positive
outcomes
that
may
be
longer
lasting
in
ITW
