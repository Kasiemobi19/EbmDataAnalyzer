Heart
rate
recovery

treadmill
exercise
score
as
predictors
of
mortality
in
patients

exercise
ECG
Abstract
Text
Both
attenuated
heart
rate
recovery
following
exercise
and
the
Duke
treadmill
exercise
score
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
independent
predictors
of
mortality
but
their
prognostic
value
relative
to
each
other
has
not
been
studied
To
assess
the
associations
among
abnormal
heart
rate
recovery
treadmill
exercise
score
and
death
in
patients
referred
specifically
for
exercise
electrocardiography
Prospective
cohort
study
conducted
in
an
academic
medical
center
between
September
1990
and
December
1997
with
a
median
follow-up
of
52
years
A
total
of
9454
consecutive
patients
(mean

age

[11]
years
78%

who
underwent
symptom-limited
exercise
electrocardiographic
testing
Exclusion
criteria
included
age

30
years
history
of
heart
failure
or
valvular
disease
pacemaker
implantation
and
uninterpretable
electrocardiograms
All-cause
mortality
as
predicted
by
abnormal
heart
rate
recovery
defined
as
failure
of
heart
rate
to
decrease
by
more
than
12/min
during
the
first
minute
after
peak
exercise
and
by
treadmill
exercise
score
defined
as
(exercise
time)
-
(5
x
maximum
ST-segment
deviation)
-
(4
x
treadmill
angina
index)
Three

deaths
occurred
in
the
cohort
Abnormal
heart
rate
recovery
and
intermediate-
or
high-risk
treadmill
exercise
score
were
present
in
20%
(n
=
1852)
and
21%
(n
=
1996)
of
patients
respectively
In
univariate
analyses
death
was

After
adjusting
for
age

standard

risk
factors
medication
use
and
other
potential
confounders
abnormal
heart
rate
recovery
remained
predictive
of
death

There
was
no
interaction
between
these
2
predictors
In
this
cohort
of
patients
referred
specifically
for
exercise
electrocardiography
both
abnormal
heart
rate
recovery
and
treadmill
exercise
score
were
independent
predictors
of
mortality
Heart
rate
recovery
appears
to
provide
additional
prognostic
information
to
the
established
treadmill
exercise
score
and
should
be
considered
for
routine
incorporation
into
exercise
test
interpretation
