Accuracy
of
five
different
diagnostic
techniques
in
mild-to-moderate
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
clinical
diagnosis
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(PID)
compared
with
the
diagnosis
of
PID
made
by
laparoscopy
endometrial
biopsy
transvaginal
ultrasound
and
cervical
and
endometrial
cultures
Study
design
A
diagnostic
performance
test
study
was
carried
out
by
cross-sectional
analysis
in
61
women
A
group
presenting
PID
(n
=
31)
was
compared
with
a
group
(n
=
30)
presenting
another
cause
for
non-specific
lower
abdominal
pain
(NSLAP)
Diagnosis
provided
by
an
evaluated
method
was
compared
with
a
standard
diagnosis
(by
surgical
findings
histopathology
and
microbiology)
The
pathologist
was
unaware
of
the
visual
findings
and
presumptive
diagnoses
given
by
other
methods
All
clinical
and
laboratory
PID
criteria
showed
low
discrimination
capacity
Adnexal
tenderness
showed
the
greatest
sensitivity
Clinical
diagnosis
had
87%
sensitivity
while
laparoscopy
had
81%
sensitivity
and
100%
specificity
transvaginal
ultrasound
had
30%
sensitivity
and
67%
specificity
and
endometrial
culture
had
83%
sensitivity
and
26%
specificity
Clinical
criteria
represent
the
best
diagnostic
method
for
discriminating
PID
Laparoscopy
showed
the
best
specificity
and
is
thus
useful
in
those
cases
having
an
atypical
clinical
course
for
discarding
abdominal
pain
when
caused
by
another
factor
The
other
diagnostic
methods
might
have
limited
use
