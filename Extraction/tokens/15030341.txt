Abstract
Text
Topical
corticosteroids
are
the
usual
treatment
for
atopic
dermatitis
(AD)
in
children
but
can
have
side-effects
This
study
compared
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
003%
tacrolimus
ointment
applied
once
or
twice
daily
over
a
3-week
period
with
the
twice
daily
application
of
1%
hydrocortisone
acetate
(HA)
ointment
in
children
with
moderate
to
severe
AD
Patients
applied
ointment
daily
to
all
affected
body
surface
areas
The
primary
study
endpoint
was
the
percentage
change
in
the
modified
Eczema
Area
and
Severity
Index
(mEASI)
between
baseline
and
treatment
end
Six
hundred
and
twenty-four
patients
aged
2-15
years
applied
003%
tacrolimus
ointment
once
daily
(n
=
207)
twice
daily
(n
=
210)
or
1%
HA
twice
daily
(n
=
207)
By
the
end
of
treatment
application
of
003%
tacrolimus
ointment
both
once
or
twice
daily
resulted
in
significantly
greater
median
percentage
decreases
in
mEASI
(667%
and
767%
respectively)
compared
with
1%
HA
(476%
P
<
0001)
Furthermore
the
median
percentage
decrease
in
mEASI
was
significantly
greater
for
patients
applying
003%
tacrolimus
twice
daily
compared
with
once
daily
(P
=
0007)
Patients
with
severe
AD
benefited
especially
from
twice
daily
application
of
003%
tacrolimus
ointment
compared
with
once
daily
application
(P
=
0001)
Transient
mild
to
moderate
skin
burning
occurred
significantly
more
often
in
the
003%
tacrolimus
groups
(P
=
0028)
but
resolved
in
most
cases
within
3-4
days
Laboratory
parameters
showed
no
clinically
relevant
changes
003%
tacrolimus
ointment
applied
once
or
twice
daily
is
significantly
more
efficacious
than
1%
HA
in
treating
moderate-severe
AD
in
children
Twice
daily
application
of
003%
tacrolimus
ointment
results
in
the
greatest
improvement
in
mEASI
and
is
especially
effective
in
patients
with
severe
baseline
disease
