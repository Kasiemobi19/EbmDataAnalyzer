Title
Donepezil
for
mild
cognitive
impairment
Abstract
Text
Problems
with
memory
which
do
not
meet
the
diagnostic
criteria
for
dementia
usually
called
mild
cognitive
impairment
(MCI)
can
be
the
first
sign
of
an
impending
dementia
particularly
Alzheimer's
disease
(AD)
There
is
no
consensus
on
a
definition
or
diagnostic
criteria
for
MCI
and
MCI
remains
a
vague
term
and
those
so
described
are
a
heterogeneous
population
consisting
of
people
who
may
rapidly
progress
to
dementia
but
also
of
people
with
stable
cognitive
deficits
and
some
who
may
actually
improve
Treatment
in
the
very
earliest
stages
of
AD
may
delay
progression
to
AD
Donepezil
(Aricept
E2020)
a
cholinesterase
inhibitor
has
been
shown
to
benefit
all
severities
of
AD
including
mild
and
it
would
be
reasonable
to
investigate
its
efficacy
for
those
with
MCI
To
assess
the
effects
of
donepezil
in
people
with
mild
cognitive
impairment
but
no
diagnosis
of
dementia
The
trials
were
identified
from
a
search
of
the
Specialized
Register
of
the
Cochrane
Dementia
and
Cognitive
Improvement
Group
on
6
January
2006
This
register
contains
records
from
major
health
care
databases
like
CENTRAL
MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
and
PsycINFO
and
many
ongoing
trial
databases
and
is
updated
regularly
All
double
blind
randomized
trials
in
which
treatment
with
donepezil
was
compared
with
placebo
for
patients
with
mild
cognitive
impairment
Data
were
extracted
from
the
published
reports
of
the
included
studies
pooled
where
appropriate
and
the
treatment
effects
or
the
risks
and
benefits
estimated
The
two
included
studies
with
a
total
of
782
patients
all
with
a
MMSE
greater
than
23
points
identified
similar
patients
for
inclusion
but
were
quite
different
with
respect
to
design
and
objective
Pooling
results
in
a
meta-analysis
was
not
possible
In
the
first
study
the
13-item
ADAS-Cog
showed
benefit
associated
with
10

donepezil
compared
with
placebo
at
24
weeks
(MD

but
four
other
measures
of
cognitive
function
did
not
The

the
end
of

weeks
withdrawals
due
to
an
adverse

and
numbers
experiencing
an
adverse
event
showed
a
significant
difference
between
the
donepezil
group
and
the
placebo
group
in
favour
of
placebo
(43/133
donepezil
23/137

to

donepezil
100/137
placebo
OR
252
95%

134
to
476
p=0004)
Various
adverse
effects
were
recorded
and
several
types
of
event
diarrhoea
nausea
vomiting
leg
cramps
and
abnormal
dreams
were
reported
more
frequently
in
the
donepezil
group
compared
with
the
placebo
In
the
second
study
there
was
a
significant
difference
between
the
number
of
patients
diagnosed
with
AD
or
another
dementia
between
the
donepezil
group
and
the
placebo
group
in
favour
of
donepezil
after
one
year
of
treatment
(16/253
donepezil
38/259
placebo)
(OR
039
95%
CI
021
to
072
p=0003)
but
no
difference
after
3
years
of
treatment
(63/253
donepezil
73/259
placebo)
(OR
084
95%
CI
057
to
125
p=04)
There
are
two
included
studies
One
study
demonstrated
a
modest
treatment
effect
in
cognitive
function
as
assessed
by
ADAS-Cog13
but
not
for
other
outcomes
assessing
different
domains
of
cognitive
function
Donepezil
was
associated
with
significantly
more
adverse
effects
compared
with
placebo
mostly
gastrointestinal
From
the
second
study
there
is
no
evidence
that
donepezil
delays
the
onset
of
AD
There
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
use
of
donepezil
for
patients
with
MCI
The
putative
benefits
are
minor
short
lived
and
associated
with
significant
side
effects
