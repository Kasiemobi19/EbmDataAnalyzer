Title
Toxic
effects
of
isoniazid
in
tuberculosis
chemoprophylaxis
Role
of
biochemical
monitoring
in
1000
patients
Abstract
Text
One
thousand
patients
receiving
isoniazid
chemoprophylaxis
were
prospectively
followed
up
to
assess
the
value
of
liver
function
monitoring
plus
monthly
clinical
evaluation
Two
hundred
twenty-two
(222%)
of
the
patients
had
at
least
one
elevated
SGOT
level
during
the
course
of
treatment
and
47
asymptomatic
persons
had
isoniazid
therapy
discontinued
because
of
consistent
elevations
greater
than
five
times
normal
Another
17
had
symptoms
in
association
with
elevated
SGOT
levels
and
therapy
was
stopped
in
these
patients
as
well
No
patient
became
seriously
ill
and
there
were
no
deaths
Biochemical
monitoring
should
be
done
routinely
in
patients
receiving
isoniazid
chemoprophylaxis
to
avoid
the
development
of
irreversible
hepatic
reactions
