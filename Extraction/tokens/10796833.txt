Progestogens
versus
oestrogens
and
progestogens
for
irregular
uterine
bleeding
associated
with
anovulation
Abstract
Text
Dysfunctional
uterine
bleeding
(DUB)
is
"excessively
heavy
prolonged
or
frequent
bleeding
of
uterine
origin
which
is
not
due
to
pregnancy
or
to
recognizable
pelvic
or
systemic
disease"
Anovulation
may
be
inferred
from
a
number
of
observations
but
in
the
normal
clinical
situation
anovulation
is
often
assumed
when
a
woman
presents
with
heavy
prolonged
or
frequent
bleeding
particularly
in
those
at
the
extremes
of
reproductive
life
and
in
women
known
to
have
the
polycystic
ovarian
syndrome
Menstrual
bleeding
that
is
irregular
or
excessive
is
usually
poorly
tolerated
by
the
majority
of
women
Changes
in
the
length
of
the
menstrual
cycle
generally
imply
disturbances
of
the
hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian
(HPO)
axis
In
anovulatory
DUB
with
acyclic
(irregular)
oestrogen
production
there
will
be
no
progesterone
withdrawal
from
oestrogen
primed
endometrium
and
so
cycles
are
irregular
Prolonged
oestrogen
stimulation
may
cause
a
build
up
of
endometrium
with
erratic
bleeding
as
it
breaks
down
and
is
expelled
This
is
the
rationale
for
using
cyclical
progestogens
during
the
second
half
of
the
menstrual
cycle
in
order
to
provoke
a
regular
withdrawal
bleed
Continuous
progestogen
is
intended
to
induce
endometrial
atrophy
and
hence
to
prevent
oestrogen-stimulated
endometrial
proliferation
Progestogens
and
oestrogens
and
progestogens
in
combination
are
already
widely
used
in
the
management
of
irregular
or
excessive
bleeding
due
to
DUB
but
the
regime
dose
and
type
of
progestogen
used
varies
widely
with
little
consensus
about
the
optimum
treatment
approach
To
determine
the
effectiveness
and
acceptability
of
progestogens
alone
and
oestrogens
and
progestogens
in
combination
in
the
management
of
irregular
bleeding
associated
with
anovulation
The
search
strategy
of
the
Menstrual
Disorders
Group
was
used
to
identify
all
randomised
trials
of
progestogens
alone
or
in
combination
with
oestrogens
in
the
management
of
irregular
menstrual
bleeding
associated
with
anovulation
In
addition
a
search
of
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
was
undertaken
All
randomised
controlled
trials
of
progestogens
(via
any
route)
alone
or
in
combination
with
oestrogens
in
the
treatment
of
irregular
bleeding
associated
with
anovulation
Study
quality
assessment
and
data
extraction
were
carried
out
independently
by
two
reviewers
Both
reviewers
were
experts
in
the
content
matter
No
randomised
trials
were
identified
which
compared
progestogens
with
oestrogens
and
progestogens
in
the
management
of
irregular
bleeding
associated
with
anovulation
Only
one
small
non-randomised
study
compared
two
progestogen
regimes
in
the
management
of
heavy
and
irregular
bleeding
in
subjects
with
confirmed
anovulation
One
randomised
study
compared
the
effects
of
two
progestogens
on
endometrial
histology
in
subjects
with
a
variety
of
menstrual
symptoms
half
of
whom
had
cystic
glandular
hyperplasia
No
studies
were
found
which
compared
progestogens
with
oestrogens
and
progestogens
in
combination
or
with
placebo
in
the
management
of
irregular
bleeding
associated
with
anovulation
There
is
a
paucity
of
randomised
studies
relating
to
the
use
of
progestogens
and
of
oestrogens
and
progestogens
in
combination
in
the
treatment
of
irregular
bleeding
associated
with
anovulation
Further
research
is
needed
to
establish
the
role
of
these
treatments
in
the
management
of
this
common
gynaecological
problem
