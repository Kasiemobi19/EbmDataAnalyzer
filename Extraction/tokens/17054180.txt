Title
Formulas
containing
hydrolysed
protein
for
prevention
of
allergy
and
food
intolerance
in
infants
Abstract
Text
Allergies
and
food
reactions
are
common
and
may
be
associated
with
foods
including
adapted
cow's
milk
formula
Formulas
containing
hydrolysed
proteins
have
been
used
to
treat
infants
with
allergy
or
food
intolerance
However
it
is
unclear
whether
hydrolysed
formula
can
be
advocated
for
prevention
of
allergy
and
food
intolerance
in
infants
without
evidence
of
allergy
or
food
intolerance
To
determine
the
effect
of
feeding
hydrolysed
formulas
on
allergy
and
food
intolerance
in
infants
and
children
compared
to
adapted
cow's
milk
or
human
breast
milk
If
hydrolysed
formulas
are
effective
to
determine
what
type
of
hydrolysed
formula
is
most
effective
including
extensively
and
partially
hydrolysed
formulas
To
determine
which
infants
benefit
including
infants
at
low
or
high
risk
of
allergy
and
infants
receiving
early
short
term
or
prolonged
formula
feeding
The
standard
search
strategy
of
the
Cochrane
Neonatal
Review
Group
was
used
The
review
was
updated
with

Randomised

of

Primary

Meta-analysis
was
conducted
using

Two

No

Two

Ten

Meta-analysis

No

examined
the

There
is
evidence
that
preterm

fed
a
hydrolysed
preterm

have
significantly
reduced

not
in

Studies

report
no

Subgroup

Methodological
concerns
were
the

as
for

Analysis
of

no

Infants
fed
extensively

had

Comparing

There
is
no
evidence
to
support
feeding
with
a
hydrolysed
formula
for
the
prevention
of
allergy
compared
to
exclusive
breast
feeding
In
high
risk
infants
who
are
unable
to
be
completely
breast
fed
there
is
limited
evidence
that
prolonged
feeding
with
a
hydrolysed
formula
compared
to
a
cow's
milk
formula
reduces
infant
and
childhood
allergy
and
infant
CMA
In
view
of
methodological
concerns
and
inconsistency
of
findings
further
large
well
designed
trials
comparing
formulas
containing
partially
hydrolysed
whey
or
extensively
hydrolysed
casein
to
cow's
milk
formulas
are
needed
