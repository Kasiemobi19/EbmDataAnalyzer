Title
Metabolic
and
cardiovascular
effects
of
carvedilol
and
atenolol
in
non-insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
and
hypertension
A
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Diabetic
patients
are
considered
less
suitable
than
nondiabetic
patients
for
beta-blocker
therapy
because
of
the
risk
for
worsened
glucose
and
lipid
metabolism
and
more
severe
hypoglycemic
attacks
To
compare
the
metabolic
and
cardiovascular
effects
of
carvedilol
with
those
of
atenolol
in
diabetic
patients
with
hypertension
Randomized
double-blind
24-week
trial
University
hospital
clinic
45
patients
with
non-insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
and
hypertension
After
a
4-
to
6-week
run-in
period
during
which
placebo
was
given
in
a
single-blind
manner
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
carvedilol
or
atenolol
An
oral
glucose
tolerance
test
assessment
of
insulin
sensitivity
and
hormonal
responses
to
insulin
hypoglycemia
and
assessment
of
lipid
levels
blood
pressure
left
ventricular
mass
and
lipid
peroxidation
Changes
in
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
and
left
ventricular
mass
index
were
similar
with
carvedilol
and
atenolol
(P
>
02)
Fasting
plasma
glucose
and
insulin
levels
decreased
with
carvedilol
and
increased
with
atenolol
Responses
to
carvedilol
were
greater
than
those
to
atenolol
as
follows
increase
in
total
glucose
disposal
954
mumol/kg

(CI
-075

increase
in
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
level
013
mmol/L
(CI
009
to
017
mmol/L
P
<
0001)
and
decrease
in
lipid
peroxidation
025
mumol/L
(CI
-034
to
-016
mumol/L)
By
improving
glucose
and
lipid
metabolism
and
reducing
lipid
peroxidation
carvedilol
may
offer
advantages
in
patients
with
diabetes
and
hypertension
