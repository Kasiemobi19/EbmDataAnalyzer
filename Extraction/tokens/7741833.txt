Efficacy

in
dyslipoproteinemic
veterans
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
controlled-release
niacin
in
patients
with
hyperlipoproteinemia
A
retrospective
cohort
study
A
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Center
A
consecutive
sample
of
969
predominantly
elderly
male
veterans
treated
for
dyslipoproteinemia
with
controlled-release
niacin
between
October
1988
and
October
1991
Primary
outcomes
were
lipid
levels
and
lipoprotein
cholesterol
response
alternations
in
levels
of
hepatic
enzymes
and
blood
chemistry
test
results
and
characterization
of
niacin-induced
hepatotoxicity
abstracted
from
the
patient's
medical
laboratory
and
pharmacy
records
93%
(896
of
969)
of
the
cohort
was
evaluable
Patients
(age
617
years
[94
years]
mean
[SD])
were
treated
for
1
to
36
months
(130
months
[97
months])
with
an
average
maintenance
dose
of
167
g/d
(08
g/d)
Niacin
was
discontinued
in
485%
(435
of
896)
of
the
patients
primarily
because
of
adverse
effects
Poor
glycemic
control
led
to
discontinuation
in
406%
(43
of
106)
of
the
patients
with
diabetes
mellitus
The
lipoprotein
response
was
dose-related
and
favorable
(levels
of
total
cholesterol
-191%
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
-240%
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
+57%
and
triglycerides
-325%)
Statistically
but
not
clinically
meaningful
dose-related
increases
were
seen
in
levels
of
liver
enzymes
and
serum
glucose
(aspartate
aminotransferase
+29%
alanine
aminotransferase
+23%
alkaline
phosphatase
+25%
and
glucose
+7%
P
=
00001)
Twenty
of
896
(22%)
and
42
of
896
(47%)
patients
met
biochemical
criteria
for
probable
and
for
possible
or
probable
niacin-induced
hepatotoxicity
respectively
Predisposing
factors
included
high
dose
alcohol
use
preexisting
liver
disease
and
concurrent
oral
sulfonylurea
therapy
Controlled-release
niacin
is
effective
in
treating
dyslipoproteinemia
in
selected
middle-aged
and
elderly
veterans
but
approximately
one
half
of
patients
discontinued
the
drug
because
of
adverse
effects
or
other
causes
including
noncompliance
Niacin
should
be
avoided
in
patients
with
hepatic
dysfunction
or
a
history
of
liver
disease
patients
with
diabetes
mellitus
and
patients
who
abuse
alcohol
Because
controlled-release
niacin
seems
to
be
more
potent
than
crystalline
niacin
product
substitution
without
dose
adjustment
should
be
avoided
