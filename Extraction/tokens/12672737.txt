Title
Statin-associated
myopathy
Abstract
Text
Statins
(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
reductase
inhibitors)
are
associated
with
skeletal
muscle
complaints
including
clinically
important
myositis
and
rhabdomyolysis
mild
serum
creatine
kinase
(CK)
elevations
myalgia
with
and
without
elevated
CK
levels
muscle
weakness
muscle
cramps
and
persistent
myalgia
and
CK
elevations
after
statin
withdrawal
We
performed
a
literature
review
to
provide
a
clinical
summary
of
statin-associated
myopathy
and
discuss
possible
mediating
mechanisms
We
also
update
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
reports
on
statin-associated
rhabdomyolysis
Articles
on
statin
myopathy
were
identified
via
a
PubMed
search
through
November
2002
and
articles
on
statin
clinical
trials
case
series
and
review
articles
were
identified
via
a
PubMed
search
through
January
2003
Adverse
event
reports
of
statin-associated
rhabdomyolysis
were
also
collected
from
the
FDA
MEDWATCH
database
The
literature
review
found
that
reports
of
muscle
problems
during
statin
clinical
trials
are
extremely
rare
The
FDA
MEDWATCH
Reporting
System
lists
3339
cases
of
statin-associated
rhabdomyolysis
reported
between
January
1
1990
and
March
31
2002
Cerivastatin
was
the
most
commonly
implicated
statin
Few
data
are
available
regarding
the
frequency
of
less-serious
events
such
as
muscle
pain
and
weakness
which
may
affect
1%
to
5%
of
patients
The
risk
of
rhabdomyolysis
and
other
adverse
effects
with
statin
use
can
be
exacerbated
by
several
factors
including
compromised
hepatic
and
renal
function
hypothyroidism
diabetes
and
concomitant
medications
Medications
such
as
the
fibrate
gemfibrozil
alter
statin
metabolism
and
increase
statin
plasma
concentration
How
statins
injure
skeletal
muscle
is
not
clear
although
recent
evidence
suggests
that
statins
reduce
the
production
of
small
regulatory
proteins
that
are
important
for
myocyte
maintenance
