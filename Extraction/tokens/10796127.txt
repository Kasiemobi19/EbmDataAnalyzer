Title
Human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
for
recurrent
miscarriage
Abstract
Text
There
may
be
an
association
between
recurrent
miscarriage
and
abnormal
hormone
function
in
the
follicular
phase
Human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
may
play
a
role
in
preventing
miscarriages
The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
administration
during
early
pregnancy
on
the
risk
of
miscarriage
in
women
with
a
history
of
recurrent
miscarriage
The
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group
trials
register
was
searched
Date
of
last
search
9
January
1998
Randomised
trials
of
human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
compared
with
placebo
or
no
treatment
in
women
who
have
had
two
or
more
miscarriages
Eligibility
and
trial
quality
were
assessed
by
one
reviewer
Four
trials
involving
180
women
were
included
The
trials
were
of
variable
quality
Human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
was
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
miscarriage
for
women
with
a
history
of
recurrent
miscarriage
(odds
ratio
026
95%
confidence
interval
014
to
052)
This
result
should
be
interpreted
cautiously
because
the
apparent
effect
is
greatly
influenced
by
the
two
methodologically
weaker
studies
There
is
not
enough
evidence
to
evaluate
the
use
of
human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
during
pregnancy
in
order
to
prevent
miscarriage
in
women
with
a
history
of
unexplained
recurrent
spontaneous
miscarriage
