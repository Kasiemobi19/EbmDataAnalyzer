Obstetric
outcome
in
women
who
present
with
a
reduction
in
fetal
movements
in
the
third
trimester
of
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
A
complaint
of
decreased
fetal
movements
is
a
common
indication
for
the
assessment
of
fetal
well
being
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
review
the
outcome
of
a
group
of
women
whose
primary
indication
for
referral
was
decreased
fetal
movements
Over
a
20
month
period
435
patients
were
seen
in
the
fetal
assessment
unit
of
an
inner
London
teaching
hospital
following
a
primary
complaint
of
reduced
fetal
movements
Investigations
included
the
fetal
abdominal
circumference
(AC)
amniotic
fluid
volume
(AFV)
the
umbilical
artery
pulsatility
index
(UAPI)
derived
from
Doppler
ultrasound
waveforms
and
a
computerised
analysis
of
fetal
heart
rate
(FHR)
recordings
or
cardiotocograph
(CTG)
Outcome
measures
were
gestational
age
at
delivery
Apgar
score
<
7
at
5
minutes
admission
to
the
Special
Care
Baby
Unit
(SCBU)
the
need
for
delivery
by
an
emergency
cesarean
section
for
fetal
compromise
(CSFC)
and
any
perinatal
deaths
A
comparison
of
actual
versus
expected
outcome
for
women
with
decreased
fetal
movement
revealed
the
following
relative
risks
with
the
95%
confidence
intervals
(CI)
in
brackets
low
5
minute
Apgar
score
003
vs
005
expected
(CI
=
001
005)
SCBU
admission
006
vs
007
(004
008)
and
preterm
delivery
008
vs
011
(005
010)
Cesarean
sections
for
fetal
compromise
007
vs
0053
(0050-0096)
The
addition
of
FHR
monitoring
to
standard
ultrasound
assessment
of
well
being
did
not
appear
to
confer
any
added
benefit
There
were
no
fetal
deaths
The
outcome
for
pregnancies
where
the
mother
presents
with
decreased
fetal
movements
in
the
third
trimester
is
comparable
with
the
outcome
for
the
general
population
