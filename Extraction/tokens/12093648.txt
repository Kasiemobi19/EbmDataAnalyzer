Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
platelet
counts
complete
blood
counts
and
Westergren
sedimentation
rates
(WESR)
of
patients
with
a
biopsy
positive
for
giant
cell
arteritis
(GCA)
with
those
of
patients
with
negative
biopsies
Retrospective
case-control
series
The
medical
records
of
91
consecutive
patients
who
underwent
temporal
artery
biopsy
for
possible
GCA
over
an
8-year
period
were
reviewed
Values
obtained
for
the
complete
blood
counts
including
platelet
counts
WESR
and
biopsy
results
of
91
consecutive
patients
undergoing
temporal
artery
biopsy
were
analyzed
The
mean
platelet
count
of
47
patients
with
positive
temporal
artery
biopsies
(433
x
10(3)/microl)
was
significantly
higher
than
that
of
44
patients
with
negative
temporal
artery
biopsies
(277
x
10(3)/microl)
P
<
00001
There
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
in
the
mean
WESR
between
the
biopsy-positive
(82
mm/hour)
and
biopsy-negative
(70
mm/hour)
groups
P
=
012
The
sensitivity
of
an
elevated
WESR
for
biopsy-positive
patients
was
greater
(79%
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
64%-89%)
than
that
of
an
elevated
platelet
count
(57%
95%
CI
42%-72%)
However
the
specificity
(91%
[95%
CI
78%-97%]
versus
27%
[95%
CI
15%-43%])
positive
predictive
value
(87%
[95%
CI
70%-96%]
versus
54%
[95%
CI
41%-66%])
and
negative
predictive
value
(67%
[95%
CI
53%-78%]
versus
55%
[95%
CI
32%-76%])
favored
an
elevated
platelet
count
compared
with
WESR
or
to
the
combination
of
platelets
and
WESR
as
a
better
test
for
diagnosing
GCA
in
the
91
patients
studied
The
area
under
the
receiver
operating
characteristic
function
for
platelets
(072)
was
greater
than
that
for
WESR
(059)
or
the
combination
of
platelets
and
WESR
(065)
In
patients
suspected
of
having
GCA
an
elevated
platelet
count
greater
than
400
x
10(3)/microl
is
a
useful
marker
of
a
positive
temporal
artery
biopsy
