Abstract
Text
This
is
the
final
report
on
mortality
amongst
men
in
the
WHO
cooperative
trial
of
the
prevention
of
ischaemic
heart
disease
(IHD)
by
clofibrate
and
it
takes
the
follow-up
a
further
4
years
to
the
end
of
1982
Mean
observation
was
132
years
53
in
the
trial
and
79
afterwards
1788
deaths
were
recorded
in
208
000
man-years
In
the
877
new
deaths
reported
here
there
was
an
excess
of
9
deaths
in
the
high
cholesterol
control
group
compared
with
the
clofibrate-treated
group
In
the
whole
period
there
were
70
(11%)
more
deaths
in
the
clofibrate-treated
group
Excess
mortality
in
the
clofibrate-treated
group
was
much
greater
during
the
"treatment
period"
(there
was
an
excess
of
47%
during
treatment
compared
with
5%
after
treatment
had
ended)
and
was
due
to
a
wide
variety
of
causes
other
than
IHD
Thus
the
excess
mortality
in
the
clofibrate-treated
group
has
not
continued
after
the
end
of
treatment
The
substantial
excess
previously
reported
remains
unexplained
