Title
Preparticipation
evaluation
an
evidence-based
review
Abstract
Text
To
review
available
evidence
establishing
the
validity
of
the
preparticipation
evaluation
(PPE)
as
a
method
for
screening
health
risk
prior
to
participation
in
exercise
and
sport
Specific
emphasis
was
placed
on
reviewing
original
research
evaluating
methods
to
screen
participants
for
risk
of
sudden
cardiovascular
death
Literature
on
the
current
state
of
the
PPE
as
a
screening
tool
for
athletic
participation
was
examined
Electronic
databases
were
searched
for
articles
relating
to
mass
screening
for
sports
participation
and
sudden
cardiac
death
in
athletes
published
up
to
January
2004
Databases
searched
included

Additional
references
from
the

of

articles
were
also
reviewed
All
study
designs
were
retrieved
but
only
those
studying
athletes
and/or
student-athletes
under
age
36
years
were
reviewed
Of
the
original
research
retrieved
the
majority
of
the
articles
sought
to
establish
incidence
or
prevalence
of
cardiovascular
causes
of
sudden
death
in
athletes
or
the
validity
of
various
screening
tools
Original
research
articles
seeking
to
establish
the
current
use
of
the
PPE
in
all
its
various
forms
were
also
reviewed
All
of
the
articles
selected
for
review
consisted
of
type
II
population-based
data
The
initial
literature
search
identified
639
papers
Of
these
310
articles
that
met
the
selection
criteria
were
reviewed
and
25
articles
were
identified
as
original
research
directly
relating
to
the
PPE
All
of
these
contained
type
II
evidence-population-based
clinical
studies
The
majority
of
the
literature
on
the
PPE
consists
of
type
III
evidence-case-based
opinion
papers
and
position
papers
from
respected
authors
and
sports
medicine
societies
and
reports
of
expert
committees
This
literature
was
also
reviewed
but
only
original
research
relevant
to
the
PPE
is
reported
in
this
article
The
majority
of
these
studies
examined
cardiovascular
diseases
and
screening
procedures
The
5
studies
that
assessed
the
format
or
effectiveness
of
the
PPE
concluded
that
it
was
inadequate
The
format
of
the
PPE
is
not
standardized
and
does
not
consistently
address
the
American
Heart
Association
recommendations
for
cardiovascular
screening
history
and
physical
exams
A
variety
of
health
care
professionals
some
without
proper
training
administer
the
PPE
The
12
original
studies
that
looked
at
specific
cardiovascular
screening
techniques
were
divided
on
the
effectiveness
of
history
physical
examination
electrocardiogram
and
echocardiography
for
detecting
cardiovascular
risks
for
sudden
death
in
athletes
A
PPE
is
required
by
most
sport
organizations
in
America
but
research
as
to
its
effectiveness
is
very
limited
PPEs
have
been
mandatory
in
Italy
for
many
years
and
we
can
draw
on
some
the
data
recorded
over
this
time
Otherwise
very
few
studies
in
America
or
elsewhere
have
been
performed
on
the
PPE
process
The
research
available
indicates
that
the
PPE
is
not
implemented
adequately
or
uniformly
An
opportunity
exists
to
create
a
standardized
validated
PPE
that
meets
medical
standards
for
quality
and
provides
sensitive
specific
screening
of
potential
participants
in
sport
and
exercise
