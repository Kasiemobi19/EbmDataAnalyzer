Abstract
Text
A
randomised
controlled
trial
was
conducted
to
determine
if
physicians'
advice
to
promote
physical
activity
to
patients
was
more
effective
if
the
advice
was
tailored
to
the
management
of
hypertension
compared
with
more
general
health
promotion
advice
Participants
included
inactive
40-
to
70-year-old
patients
visiting
the
physicians'
during
study
recruitment
period
Physicians
provided
verbal
physical
activity
advice
and
written
materials
both
tailored
to
either
general
health
promotion
messages
or
specifically
as
a
means
for
treating
or
managing
hypertension
Seventy-five
physicians
and
98%
(767/780)
of
screened
eligible
patients
participated
in
the
study
Differences
between
intervention
and
control
groups
self-reported
physical
activity
were
assessed
over
6
months
Follow-up
response
rates
were
92
and
84%
at
the
2-
and
6-month
assessments
There
were
no
consistent
significant
differences
between
groups
at
the
2-
or
6-month
assessments
Thus
neither
intervention
strategy
resulted
in
significant
changes
in
patients
self-reported
physical
activity
regardless
of
the
whether
the
advice
was
tailored
to
hypertension
management
or
general
health
promotion
advice
