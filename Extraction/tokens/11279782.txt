Title
Glucosamine
therapy
for
treating
osteoarthritis
Abstract
Text
Osteoarthritis
(OA)
is
the
most
common
form
of
arthritis
and
it
is
often
associated
with
significant
disability
and
an
impaired
quality
of
life
To
review
all
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
evaluating
the
effectiveness
and
toxicity
of
glucosamine
in
osteoarthritis
(OA)
We
searched
MEDLINE
Embase
and
Current
Contents
up
to
November
1999
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
We
also
wrote
letters
to
content
experts
and
hand
searched
reference
lists
of
identified
RCTs
and
pertinent
review
articles
Relevant
studies
met
the
following
criteria
1)
RCTs
evaluating
the
effectiveness
and
safety
of
glucosamine
in
OA
2)
Both
placebo
based
and
comparative
studies
were
eligible
3)
Both
single
blinded
and
double-blinded
studies
were
eligible
Data
abstraction
was
performed
independently
by
two
investigators
and
the
results
were
compared
for
degree
of
agreement
Gotzsche's
method
and
a
validated
tool
(Jadad
1995)
were
used
to
score
the
quality
of
the
RCTs
Continuous
outcome
measures
were
pooled
using
standardized
mean
differences
Dichotomous
outcome
measures
were
pooled
using
Peto
Odds
Ratios
Collectively
the
16
identified
RCTs
provided
evidence
that
glucosamine
is
both
effective
and
safe
in
OA
In
the
13
RCTs
in
which
glucosamine
was
compared
to
placebo
glucosamine
was
found
to
be
superior
in
all
RCTs
except
one
In
the
four
RCTs
in
which
glucosamine
was
compared
to
an
NSAID
glucosamine
was
superior
in
two
and
equivalent
in
two
Further
research
is
necessary
to
confirm
the
long
term
effectiveness
and
toxicity
of
glucosamine
therapy
in
OA
Most
of
the
trials
reviewed
only
evaluated
the
Rotta
preparation
of
glucosamine
sulfate
It
is
not
known
whether
different
glucosamine
preparations
prepared
by
different
manufacturers
are
equally
effective
in
the
therapy
of
OA
