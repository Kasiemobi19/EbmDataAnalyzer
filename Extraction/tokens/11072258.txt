An
international
evaluation
of
the
cancer-preventive
potential
of
sunscreens
Abstract
Text
The
IARC
convened
a
working
group
of
experts
in
Lyon
France
on
10-18
April
2000
to
evaluate
the
cancer-preventive
activity
of
sunscreens
and
to
compile
the
fifth
volume
of
the
IARC
Handbooks
of
Cancer
Prevention
The
working
group
concluded
that
the
topical
use
of
sunscreens
reduces
the
risk
of
sunburn
in
humans
and
that
sunscreens
probably
prevent
squamous-cell
carcinoma
of
the
skin
when
used
mainly
during
unintentional
sun
exposure
No
conclusion
can
be
drawn
about
the
cancer-preventive
activity
of
topical
use
of
sunscreens
against
basal-cell
carcinoma
and
cutaneous
melanoma
Use
of
sunscreens
can
extend
the
duration
of
intentional
sun
exposure
such
as
sunbathing
Such
an
extension
may
increase
the
risk
for
cutaneous
melanoma
The
working
group
warned
against
relying
solely
on
sunscreens
for
protection
from
UV
radiation
