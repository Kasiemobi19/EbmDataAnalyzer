Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effect
of
lovastatin
therapy
on
health-related
quality
of
life
in
older
persons
A
prospective
randomized
double
blind
clinical
trial
Four
university
medical
center
research
clinics
There
were
431
men
and
women
primarily
65
years
of
age
or
older
with
low
density
lipoprotein
levels
greater
than
159
mg/dL
and
less
than
221
mg/dL
Exclusion
criteria
included
a
Mini-Mental
state
score
less
than
24
or
presence
of
recent
cardiovascular
events
or
other
serious
chronic
disease
likely
to
shorten
survival
All
participants
were
administered
the
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
step
one
diet
and
were
then
randomized
to
placebo
20
mg
lovastatin
or
40
mg
lovastatin
Areas
of
health-related
quality
of
life
assessed
in
the
Cholesterol
Reduction
in
Seniors
Program
(CRISP)
included
(1)
physical
functioning
(2)
sleep
behavior
(3)
social
support
(4)
depression
(5)
cognitive
function
and
(6)
health
perception
Three
global
change
questions
asked
the
patients
to
judge
change
in
general
health
since
starting
the
study
diet
or
the
study
medication
and
change
in
ability
to
function
or
care
for
self
Although
some
patients
were
followed
for
a
total
of
12
months
all
participants
were
followed
for
6
months
and
6-month
data
have
been
used
for
the
primary
analysis
in
this
paper
Patients
treated
with
20
mg
of
lovastatin
had
a
17%
and
24%
reduction
in
total
cholesterol
and
LDL-cholesterol
respectively
Patients
treated
with
the
40-mg
lovastatin
dose
achieved
reductions
of
20%
for
total
cholesterol
and
28%
for
LDL-cholesterol
Complaints
of
possible
adverse
events
were
remarkably
similar
in
the
two
active
treatment
groups
and
the
placebo
group
At
6
months
of
follow-up
there
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
found
in
mean
change
scores
from
baseline
between
treatment
groups
on
the
health-related
quality
of
life
measures
(physical
functioning
sleep
social
support
depression
cognitive
function
scales
health
perception)
or
global
questions
This
study
demonstrates
that
lovastatin
was
extremely
well
tolerated
in
an
older
cohort
both
with
regard
to
symptoms
and
to
health-related
quality
of
life
