Incidence
of
deep-vein
thrombosis
in
patients
with
fractures
of
the
lower
extremity
distal
to
the
hip
Abstract
Text
Our
purpose
was
to
determine
the
incidence
of
deep-vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
in
patients
who
have
had
early
operative
fixation
of
fractures
of
the
lower
extremity
distal
to
the
hip
There
is
a
high
incidence
of
distal
thrombosis
in
patients
who
have
undergone
early
operative
fixation
of
lower-extremity
fractures
The
incidence
of
DVT
is
higher
with
proximal
extremity
fractures
than
with
distal
extremity
fractures
Most
clots
are
occult
and
do
not
progress
clinically
Given
the
high
incidence
of
DVT
with
femoral
and
tibial
plateau
fractures
older
age
and
longer
operating
times
anticoagulation
prophylaxis
may
be
indicated
Ours
was
a
prospective
incidence
study
All
patients
who
had
had
early
operative
fixation
of
lower-extremity
fractures
were
eligible
(n
=
176)
Seventy-four
were
excluded
based
on
specific
criteria
The
remaining
102
patients
underwent
lower-extremity
venography
an
average
of
9
days
after
operative
fixation
of
their
fractures
(range
3-22
days)
Eight
patients
had
bilateral
lower-extremity
fractures
The
patients
were
followed
clinically
for
6
weeks
to
identify
complications
related
to
venous
disease
The
overall
incidence
of
clinically
occult
DVT
was
28%
Of
the
represented
fractures
40%
were
of
the
femoral
shaft
(eight
of
20)
43%
of
the
tibial
plateau
(12
of
28)
22%
of
the
tibial
shaft
(12
of
54)
and
125%
of
the
tibial
plafond
(one
of
eight)
Four
of
the
thrombi
were
proximal
to
the
popliteal
fossa
Four
of
the
patients
had
clinical
evidence
of
pulmonary
embolism
while
in
the
hospital
One
of
them
had
objective
confirmation
on
further
testing
No
patient
had
clinical
evidence
of
pulmonary
emboli
as
an
outpatient
by
follow-up
criteria
The
incidence
of
DVT
has
not
been
determined
for
patients
with
early
stabilization
of
lower-extremity
fractures
This
study
suggests
a
higher
DVT
incidence
in
more
proximal
fractures
but
little
risk
of
embolization
Thrombus
formation
proximal
to
the
popliteal
fossa
is
rare
Older
age
longer
operating
times
and
longer
times
before
fracture
fixation
all
correlate
with
an
increased
incidence
of
DVT
