Early
screw
fixation
versus
casting
in
the
treatment
of
acute
Jones
fractures
Abstract
Text
There
is
considerable
variability
in
the
literature
concerning
the
optimal
treatment
of
acute
Jones
fractures
Early
surgical
fixation
of
acute
Jones
fractures
will
result
in
shorter
times
to
union
and
return
to
athletics
compared
with
cast
treatment
Randomized
controlled
clinical
trial
Level
of
evidence
1

Eighteen
patients
were
randomized
to
cast
treatment
and
19
patients
were
randomized
to
screw
fixation
Success
of
treatment
and
the
times
to
union
and
return
to
sports
were
calculated
for
each
patient
Mean
follow-up
was
253
months
(range
15-42
months)
Eight
of
18
(44%)
in
the
cast
group
were
considered
treatment
failures
5
nonunions
1
delayed
union
and
2
refractures
One
of
19
patients
in
the
surgery
group
was
considered
a
treatment
failure
For
the
surgery
group
the
median
times
to
union
and
return
to
sports
were
75
and
80
weeks
respectively
For
the
cast
group
the
median
times
were
145
and
150
weeks
respectively
The
Mann-Whitney
test
showed
a
statistically
significant
difference
between
the
groups
in
both
parameters
with
P
<
001
There
is
a
high
incidence
(44%)
of
failure
after
cast
treatment
of
acute
Jones
fractures
Early
screw
fixation
results
in
quicker
times
to
union
and
return
to
sports
compared
with
cast
treatment
