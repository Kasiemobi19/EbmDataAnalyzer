Lowering
low

Abstract
Text
In
this
double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
study
normally
cycling
women
(n
=
86)
with
elevated
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C)
levels
were
studied
over
six
menstrual
cycles
At
the
end
of
the
screening
phase
participants
received
placebo
for
the
second
menstrual
cycle
and
subsequently
were
randomized
to
receive
either
placebo
or
simvastatin
(40
mg/d)
for
the
next
four
cycles
The
second
and
sixth
menstrual
cycles
were
considered
baseline
and
treatment
cycles
respectively
Participants
kept
a
menstrual
diary
throughout
the
study
and
provided
daily
first-void
urine
samples
during
cycles
2
and
6
Urine
samples
were
assayed
for
LH
and
pregnanediol
glucuronide
(PdG)
The
primary
end
point
was
change
in
luteal
phase
duration
as
defined
by
the
day
of
the
urinary
LH
peak
to
the
day
preceding
the
onset
of
menstruation
Treatment
with
simvastatin
(40
mg/d)
effectively
lowered
LDL-C
by
343%
(P
<
0001)
Simvastatin
was
generally
well
tolerated
and
no
meaningful
difference
in
adverse
event
profile
was
observed
between
treatment
groups
Compared
with
the
placebo
group
simvastatin
did
not
have
clinically
relevant
effects
on
luteal
phase
duration
peak
PdG
concentration
or
integrated
luteal
phase
PdG
concentration
The
results
of
this
study
demonstrate
that
treatment
of
healthy
premenopausal
women
for
approximately
4
months
with
simvastatin
(40
mg/d)
lowers
LDL-C
without
adversely
affecting
reproductive
gonadal
function
Simvastatin
should
not
be
used
during
pregnancy
or
by
nursing
mothers
