Title
[Heparinoids
versus
nitroglycerin
in
the
treatment
of
superficial
phlebitis]
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
beneficial
effects
of
transdermal
nitroglycerine
(TNG)
in
the
treatment
of
superficial
phlebitis
caused
by
endovenous
catheters
and
to
compare
them
with
the
effects
from
the
application
of
heparinoid
substances
The
study
performed
was
prospective
randomized
during
a
six-day
period
One
hundred
patients
(73
male
and
27
female)
aged
28-89
years
(mean
673)
participated
in
the
study
all
presented
phlebitis
diagnosed
by
the
presence
of
pain
erythema
edema
and
fibrous
cord
in
the
area
around
the
catheter
Among
50
subjects
two
cm
of
NTG
gel
were
administered
to
the
affected
zone
once
a
day
and
for
the
other
50
subjects
heparinoid
substances
were
applied
three
times
a
day
The
value
parameters
were
time
for
the
disappearance
of
pain
and
time
for
reducing
erythema
edema
and
fibrous
cord
in
half
(all
measured
in
hours)
We
found
significant
differences
between
the
two
treatments
with
TNG
yielding
greater
improvement
in
terms
of
disappearance
of
pain
(TNG
502
+/-
397
heparinoids
720
+/-
399)
time
for
reducing
erythema
in
half
(TNG
280
+/-
242
heparinoids
546
+/-
345)
and
time
for
reducing
fibrous
cord
in
half
(TNG
583
+/-
384
heparinoids
845
+/-
415)
Edema
was
reduce
before
with
TNG
however
this
difference
was
not
significant
(TNG
312
+/-
203
heparinoids
330
+/-
257)
We
conclude
that
transcutaneous
TNG
should
be
applied
systematically
in
patients
with
superficial
phlebitis
given
that
it
is
more
effective
than
the
usual
treatment
with
heparinoid
substances
