Improvement
in
quality-of-life
measures
and
stimulation
of
weight
gain
after
treatment
with
megestrol
acetate
oral
suspension
in
geriatric
cachexia
results
of
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
Abstract
Text
Weight
loss
among
older
patients
is
a
severe
problem
associated
with
an
increased
incidence
of
infections
decubiti
and
death
Megestrol
acetate
(MA)
causes
weight
gain
in
cachectic
cancer
and
AIDS
patients
but
its
effects
in
older
cachectic
patients
are
unknown
To
compare
the
effects
of
MA
oral
suspension
(OS)
800
mg/day
versus
placebo
on
weight
in
geriatric
nursing
home
patients
with
weight
loss
or
low
body
weight

Nursing
home
patients
with
weight
loss
of
>
or
=5%
of
usual
body
weight
over
the
past
3
months
or
body
weight
20%
below
their
ideal
body
weight
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
placebo
or
MA
800
mg/day
for
12
weeks
and
were
then
followed
for
13
weeks
off
treatment
Primary
outcome
was
measured
by
weight
and
appetite
change
Secondary
outcome
measures
included
sense
of
well-being
enjoyment
of
life
change
in
depression
scale
laboratory
nutrition
parameters
energy
intake
counts
body
composition
and
adverse
events
At
12
weeks
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
weight
gain
between
treatment
groups
whereas
MA-treated
patients
reported
significantly
greater
improvement
in
appetite
enjoyment
of
life
and
well-being
Body
composition
was
not
statistically
different
between
the
two
groups
At
Week
25
(3
months
after
treatment)
619%
of
MA-treated
patients
had
gained
>
or
=182
kg
(4
lbs)
compared
to
217%
of
placebo
patients
In
geriatric
patients
with
weight
loss
or
low
body
weight
MA
improves
appetite
and
well-being
after
12
weeks
of
treatment
During
the
3
months
of
MA
treatment
there
was
no
statistically
significant
weight
gain
(>
or
=4
lbs)
Three
months
after
treatment
weight
gain
(>
or
=4
lbs)
was
significantly
increased
in
MA-treated
patients
