Long-term

of
patients

intermediate-risk
exercise
electrocardiograms

do
not

myocardial

Abstract
Text
The
appropriate
management
of
patients
with
intermediate-risk
Duke
treadmill
scores
is
not
established
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
long-term
risk
of
subsequent
cardiovascular
events
in
patients
with
an
intermediate-risk
treadmill
score
who
do
not
have
myocardial
perfusion
defects
on
radionuclide
imaging
The
existing
databases
of
the
nuclear
cardiology
laboratories
of
4
academic
institutions
were
searched
retrospectively
A
total
of
4649
patients
were
identified
who
had
intermediate-risk
Duke
treadmill
scores
(-10
to
4)
normal
or
near-normal
exercise
single
photon-emission
computed
tomographic
myocardial
perfusion
images
using
either
thallium-201
or
technetium-99m
sestamibi
and
no
previous
coronary
revascularization
Follow-up
was
95%
complete
Cardiovascular
survival
was
998%
at
1
year
990%
at
5
years
and
985%
at
7
years
Cardiac
survival
free
of
myocardial
infarction
was
similarly
high
at
966%
at
7
years
Cardiac
survival
free
of
myocardial
infarction
or
revascularization
was
871%
at
7
years
Near-normal
scans
and
cardiac
enlargement
were
independent
predictors
of
time
to
cardiac
death
Seven-year
cardiac
survival
was
still
high
at
970%
in
the
357
patients
with
near-normal
scans
and
normal
cardiac
size
and
somewhat
lower
at
890%
in
the
167
patients
with
cardiac
enlargement
Patients
with
an
intermediate-risk
treadmill
score
but
with
normal
or
near-normal
exercise
myocardial
perfusion
images
and
normal
cardiac
sizes
are
at
low
risk
for
subsequent
cardiac
death
and
can
be
safely
managed
medically
until
their
symptoms
warrant
revascularization
The
appropriate
management
of
patients
with
cardiac
enlargement
will
remain
a
matter
of
clinical
judgment
