High-dose
nedocromil
sodium
as
an
addition
to
inhaled
corticosteroids
in
the
treatment
of
asthma
Abstract
Text
In
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
nedocromil
sodium
in
a
dose
of
8
mg
four
times
daily
or
matching
placebo
was
added
to
the
treatment
of
29
asthmatic
patients
All
patients
were
taking
inhaled
corticosteroids
in
a
dose
of
up
to
1000
micrograms
daily
The
trial
agents
were
given
for
6
weeks
after
a
2-week
run-in
period
Twenty-four
patients
completed
the
study
three
withdrew
because
of
adverse
effects
two
on
placebo
Daytime
asthma
symptoms
were
significantly
reduced
on
nedocromil
compared
to
placebo
(-046
vs
+009
P
=
003)
Night-time
asthma
and
morning
tightness
were
not
changed
significantly
Bronchodilator
use
in
the
night
and
day
were
lower
on
nedocromil
but
the
differences
were
not
significant
Morning
peak
flow
rates
were
higher
on
nedocromil
(+222
vs
+008
P
=
006)
and
physicians
opinions
of
overall
effectiveness
favoured
nedocromil
(U
=
350
P
=
004)
These
results
confirm
that
nedocromil
sodium
may
be
a
useful
addition
in
asthma
to
low
to
medium
doses
of
inhaled
corticosteroids
The
effects
of
32
mg
nedocromil
daily
were
comparable
to
previous
reports
with
lower
doses
