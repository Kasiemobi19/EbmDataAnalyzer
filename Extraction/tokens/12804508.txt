Title
Acetaminophen
for
osteoarthritis
Abstract
Text
Osteoarthritis
(OA)
is
the
most
common
form
of
arthritis
Published
guidelines
and
expert
opinion
are
divided
over
the
relative
role
of
acetaminophen
(also
called
paracetamol
or
Tylenol)
and
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
as
first-line
pharmacologic
therapy
The
comparative
safety
of
acetaminophen
and
NSAIDs
is
important
to
consider
as
NSAIDs
have
the
potential
for
serious
gastrointestinal
renal
and
cardiovascular
toxicities
and
acetaminophen
in
high
dosages
(greater
than
or
equal
to
2
grams
per
day)
may
also
have
the
potential
for
serious
upper
gastrointestinal
toxicity
To
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
acetaminophen
versus
placebo
and
versus
NSAIDs
(ibuprofen
arthrotec
celecoxibnaproxen
rofecoxib)
for
treating
OA
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
(Issue

2002)
MEDLINE
(up
to
July
2002)
and
Current
Contents
(up
to
March
2002)
Reference
lists
of
identified
RCTs
and
pertinent
review
articles
were
also
hand
searched
Published
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
evaluating
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
acetaminophen
alone
in
OA
were
considered
for
inclusion
Pain
physical
function
and
global
assessment
outcomes
were
reported
Results
for
continuous
outcome
measures
were
expressed
as
standardized
mean
differences
Dichotomous
outcome
measures
were
pooled
using
relative
risk
and
the
number
needed
to
treat
was
calculated
Six
RCTs
and
1689
participants
were
included
in
the
review
One
study
compared
acetaminophen
to
placebo
and
five
compared
acetaminophen
to
NSAIDs
In
the
placebo-controlled
RCT
acetaminophen
was
shown
to
be
clearly
superior
to
placebo
with
a
similar
safety
profile
The
number
needed
to
treat
to
achieve
an
improvement
in
pain
was
three
In
the
comparator-controlled
RCTs
acetaminophen
was
less
effective
overall
than
NSAIDs
in
terms
of
pain
reduction
and
global
assessments
but
both
drugs
had
similar
efficacy
in
terms
of
improvements
in
functional
status
No
significant
difference
was
found
between
the
safety
of
acetaminophen
and
NSAIDs
although
patients
taking
NSAIDS
were
more
likely
to
withdraw
due
to
GI
events
The
evidence
to
date
suggests
that
NSAIDs
are
superior
to
acetaminophen
for
improving
knee
and
hip
pain
in
people
with
OA
but
have
not
been
shown
to
be
superior
in
improving
function
The
size
of
the
treatment
effect
was
modest
and
the
mean
trial
duration
was
only
six
weeks
therefore
additional
considerations
need
to
be
factored
in
when
making
the
decision
between
using
acetaminophen
or
NSAIDs
In
OA
subjects
with
moderate-to-severe
levels
of
pain
NSAIDs
appear
to
be
more
effective
than
acetaminophen
