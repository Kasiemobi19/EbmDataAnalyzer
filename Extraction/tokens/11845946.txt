Efficacy
and
tolerance
of
adapalene
cream
01%
compared
with
its
cream

for
the
treatment
of
acne

Abstract
Text
Adapalene
gel
01%
is
approved
for
use
in
the
treatment
of
acne
vulgaris
A
new
cream
formulation
adapalene
cream
01%
has
been
developed
Our
objective
was
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
adapalene
cream
01%
in
comparison
with
its
cream
vehicle
applied
once
daily
for
12
weeks
to
patients
with
facial
acne
vulgaris
We
used
a
12-week
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
vehicle-controlled
comparative
phase
3
study
of
adapalene
cream
01%
and
cream
vehicle
The
study
enrolled
237
patients
(125
males
and
112
females)
aged
12
through
30
years
with
mild-to-moderate
acne
vulgaris
Adapalene
cream
01%
demonstrated
superior
efficacy
compared
with
its
cream
vehicle
Significantly
lower
numbers
of
total
inflammatory
and
noninflammatory
lesion
counts
were
observed
at
the
end
of
the
study
period
in
patients
using
adapalene
cream
01%
as
opposed
to
those
using
cream
vehicle
(P<05
compared
with
baseline
for
all
3
parameters)
Adapalene
cream
01%
caused
more
cutaneous
side
effects
than
the
cream
vehicle
but
these
were
tolerated
in
most
patients
In
summary
the
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
adapalene
cream
01%
demonstrates
superior
efficacy
over
cream
vehicle
for
the
treatment
of
acne
vulgaris
Adapalene
cream
01%
also
has
excellent
tolerability
and
is
associated
with
a
low
incidence
of
cutaneous
adverse
events
