Ulcer
formation
with
low-dose
enteric-coated
aspirin
and
the
effect
of
COX-2
selective
inhibition
a
double-blind
trial
Abstract
Text
We
assessed
the
risk
of
ulcers
with
low-dose
aspirin
and
the
interaction
of
low-dose
aspirin
with
a
COX-2
selective
inhibitor
in
a
double-blind
trial
that
compared
placebo
low-dose
aspirin
rofecoxib
+
low-dose
aspirin
and
ibuprofen
Osteoarthritis
patients
>
or
=50
years
of
age
without
ulcers
or
erosive
esophagitis
at
baseline
endoscopy
were
assigned
randomly
to
placebo
enteric-coated
aspirin
81
mg/day
rofecoxib
25
mg
combined
with
aspirin
81
mg/day
or
ibuprofen
800
mg
3
times
a
day
Repeat
endoscopies
were
performed
at
6
and
12
weeks
The
12-week
cumulative
incidence
of
ulcers
was
placebo
(N
=
381)
58%
aspirin
(N
=
387)
73%
rofecoxib
combined
with
aspirin
(N
=
377)
161%
and
ibuprofen
(N
=
374)
171%
(P
<
0001
for
rofecoxib
combined
with
aspirin
and
for
ibuprofen
vs
each
of
placebo
and
aspirin)
Over
12
weeks
mean
increases
in
the
number
of
erosions
were
placebo
017
aspirin
085
(P
=
0002
vs
placebo)
rofecoxib
combined
with
aspirin
167
and
ibuprofen
191
(both
P
<
0001
vs
aspirin
and
placebo)
Low-dose
aspirin
alone
did
not
significantly
increase
ulcer
incidence
Addition
of
a
cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2)
selective
inhibitor
to
low-dose
aspirin
increased
ulcer
incidence
to
a
rate
not
significantly
less
than
a
nonselective
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
(NSAID)
alone
Determining
the
relative
impact
of
COX-2
selective
inhibitors
and
nonselective
NSAIDs
on
gastrointestinal
mucosal
injury
in
low-dose
aspirin
users
will
require
further
study
