Title
Alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
for
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
Abstract
Text
Alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
such
as
acarbose
or
miglitol
have
the
potential
to
improve
glycemic
control
in
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
The
true
value
of
these
agents
especially
in
relation
to
diabetes
related
mortality
and
morbidity
has
never
been
investigated
in
a
systematic
literature
review
and
meta-analysis
To
assess
the
effects
of
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
s
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
We
searched
The
Cochrane
Library
MEDLINE
EMBASE
Current
Contents
LILACS
databases
of
ongoing
trials
reference
lists
of
reviews
on
the
topic
of
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
and
we
contacted
experts
and
manufacturers
for
additional
trials

Randomised
controlled
trials
of
at
least
12
weeks
duration
comparing
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitor
monotherapy
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
with
any
other
intervention
and
that
included
at
least
one
of
the
following
outcomes
mortality
morbidity
quality
of
life
glycemic
control
lipids
insulin
levels
body
weight
adverse
events
Two
reviewers
read
all
abstracts
assessed
quality
and
extracted
data
independently
Discrepancies
were
resolved
by
consensus
or
by
the
judgement
of
a
third
reviewer
A
statistician
checked
all
extracted
data
entrance
in
the
database
We
attempted
to
contact
all
authors
for
data
clarification
We
included
41
trials
(8130
participants)
30
investigated
acarbose
seven
miglitol
one
trial
voglibose
and
three
trials
compared
different
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
Study
duration
was
24
weeks
in
most
cases
and
only
two
studies
lasted
amply
longer
than
one
year
We
found
only
few
data
on
mortality
morbidity
and
quality
of
life
Acarbose
had
a
clear
effect
on
glycemic
control
compared
to
placebo
glycated
haemoglobin
-08%
(95%
confidence
interval
-09
to
-07)
fasting
blood
glucose
-11
mmol/L
(95%
confidence
interval
-14
to
-09)
post-load
blood
glucose
-23
mmol/L
(95%
confidence
interval
-27
to
-19)
The
effect
on
glycated
haemoglobin
by
acarbose
was
not
dose-dependent
We
found
a
decreasing
effect
on
post-load
insulin
and
no
clinically
relevant
effects
on
lipids
or
body
weight
Adverse
effects
were
mostly
of
gastro-intestinal
origin
and
dose
dependent
Compared
to
sulphonylurea
acarbose
decreased
fasting
and
post-load
insulin
levels
by
-248
pmol/L
(95%
confidence
interval
-433
to
-63)
and
-1332
pmol/L
(95%
confidence
interval
-1845
to
-818)
respectively
and
acarbose
caused
more
adverse
effects
It
remains
unclear
whether
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
influence
mortality
or
morbidity
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
Conversely
they
have
a
significant
effect
on
glycemic
control
and
insulin
levels
but
no
statistically
significant
effect
on
lipids
and
body
weight
These
effects
are
less
sure
when
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
are
used
for
a
longer
duration
Acarbose
dosages
higher
than
50
mg
TID
offer
no
additional
effect
on
glycated
hemoglobin
but
more
adverse
effects
instead
Compared
to
sulphonylurea
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
lower
fasting
and
post-load
insulin
levels
and
have
an
inferior
profile
regarding
glycemic
control
and
adverse
effects
