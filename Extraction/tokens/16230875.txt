Abstract
Text
The
authors
used
the
meta-analytic
approach
to
examine
the
effects
of
aerobic
exercise
on
lipids
and
lipoproteins
in
adults
50
years
of
age
and
older
Twenty-eight
outcomes
representing
1427
subjects
(806
exercise
621
control)
were
available
for
pooling
Random-effects
modeling
yielded
statistically
significant
improvements
of
11%
56%
25%
and
71%
respectively
for
total
cholesterol
(mean
+/-
SEM
in

[CI]

high-density

ratio
of
total
cholesterol
to
high-density

(-08+/-02

-04
p<0001)
but
not
triglycerides
(-70+/-36
95%
CI
-140
to
01
p=006)
After
conducting
sensitivity
analyses
only
the
improvements
in
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
and
the
ratio
of
total
cholesterol
to
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
remained
statistically
significant
(p<005
for
both)
It
was
concluded
that
aerobic
exercise
increases
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
and
decreases
the
ratio
of
total
cholesterol
to
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
in
older
adults
