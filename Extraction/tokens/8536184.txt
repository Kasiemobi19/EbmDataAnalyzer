to
thrive

the
risk
of
child
abuse
a
prospective

survey
Abstract
Text
To
identify
the
relative
importance
of
failure
to
thrive
during
infancy
as
a
risk
factor
for
later
abuse
or
neglect
Whole
population
birth
cohort
(1
January
to
31
December
1986)
studied
prospectively
over
a
four
year
period
An
inner
city
health
district
in
London
England
2609
births
of
whom
47
were
identified
as
having
non-organic
failure
to
thrive
by
first
birthday
Registration
on
Child
Protection
Register
or
subject
to
investigation
of
suspected
abuse
or
neglect
without
registration
25%
(64)
of
birth
cohort
had
been
placed
on
the
Child
Protection
Register
during
the
period
1986-1990
and
a
further
12%
(32)
had
been
a
cause
for
concern
The
relative
risk
attributable
to
non-organic
failure
to
thrive
was
43
(95%
CI
165
to
1194)
and
exceeded
other
measured
risk
factors
including
birth
weight
<
2500

(95%

101
to
382)

to

ordinal
position

or

153
(95%
CI
072
to
323)
A
multiple
logistic
regression
confirmed
the
independent
contribution
of
non-organic
failure
to
thrive
to
subsequent
poor
parenting
warranting
professional
intervention
Early
postnatal
non-organic
failure
to
thrive
is
a
risk
factor
for
later
serious
parenting
deficiencies
but
previous
research
has
overstated
its
importance
Within
the
community
studied
the
nature
of
subsequent
risk
was
(non-nutritional)
neglect
rather
than
non-accidental
injury
More
than
eight
out
of
10
cases
do
not
give
further
cause
for
concern
