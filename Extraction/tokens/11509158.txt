Screening
for
microalbuminuria
to
prevent
nephropathy
in
patients
with
diabetes
a
systematic
review
of
the
evidence
Abstract
Text
Our
goal
was
to
evaluate
whether
screening
patients
with
diabetes
for
microalbuminuria
(MA)
is
effective
according
to
the
criteria
developed
by
Frame
and
Carlson
and
those
of
the
US
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
We
searched
the
MEDLINE
database
(1966-present)
and
bibliographies
of
relevant
articles
We
evaluated
the
impact
of
MA
screening
using
published
criteria
for
periodic
health
screening
tests
The
effect
of
the
correlation
between
repeated
tests
on
the
accuracy
of
a
currently
recommended
testing
strategy
was
analyzed
Quantitative
tests
have
reported
sensitivities
from
56%
to
100%
and
specificities
from
81%
to
98%
Semiquantitative
tests
for
MA
have
reported
sensitivities
from
51%
to
100%
and
specificities
from
21%
to
100%
First
morning
morning
or
random
urine
sampling
appear
feasible
Assuming
an
individual
test
sensitivity
of
90%
a
specificity
of
90%
and
a
10%
prevalence
of
MA
the
correlation
between
tests
would
have
to
be
lower
than
01
to
achieve
a
positive
predictive
value
for
repeated
testing
of
75%
Screening
for
MA
meets
only
4
of
6
Frame
and
Carlson
criteria
for
evaluating
screening
tests
The
recommended
strategies
to
overcome
diagnostic
uncertainty
by
using
repeated
testing
are
based
on
expert
opinion
are
difficult
to
follow
in
primary
care
settings
do
not
improve
diagnostic
accuracy
sufficiently
and
have
not
been
tested
in
a
controlled
trial
Although
not
advocated
by
the
American
Diabetes
Association
semiquantitative
MA
screening
tests
using
random
urine
sampling
have
acceptable
accuracy
but
may
not
be
reliable
in
all
settings
