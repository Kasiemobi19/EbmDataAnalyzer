Title
The
importance
of
the
cremasteric
reflex
in
acute
scrotal
swelling
in
children
Abstract
Text
The
correlation
between
the
presence
of
the
ipsilateral
cremasteric
reflex
and
the
absence
of
testicular
torsion
was
100
per
cent
in
a
7-year
evaluation
of
245
boys
with
acute
scrotal
swelling
The
presence
of
the
cremasteric
reflex
was
the
most
valuable
clinical
finding
in
ruling
out
testicular
torsion
and
the
absence
of
this
reflex
increased
the
suspicion
of
testis
torsion
