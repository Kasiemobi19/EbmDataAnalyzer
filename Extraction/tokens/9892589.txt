Abstract
Text
Inflammatory
reactions
in
coronary
plaques
play
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
acute
atherothrombotic
events
inflammation
elsewhere
is
also
associated
with
both
atherogenesis
generally
and
its
thrombotic
complications
Recent
studies
indicate
that
systemic
markers
of
inflammation
can
identify
subjects
at
high
risk
of
coronary
events
We
used
a
sensitive
immunoradiometric
assay
to
examine
the
association
of
serum
C-reactive
protein
(CRP)
with
the
incidence
of
first
major
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
event
in
936
men
45
to
64
years
of
age
The
subjects
who
were
sampled
at
random
from
the
general
population
participated
in
the
first
MONICA
Augsburg
survey
(1984
to
1985)
and
were
followed
for
8
years
There
was
a
positive
and
statistically
significant
unadjusted
relationship
which
was
linear
on
the
log-hazards
scale
between
CRP
values
and
the
incidence
of
CHD
events
(n=53)
The
hazard
rate
ratio
(HRR)
of
CHD
events
associated
with
a
1-SD
increase
in
log-CRP
level
was
167
(95%
CI
129
to
2
17)
After
adjustment
for
age
the
HRR
was
160
(95%
CI
123
to
2
08)
Adjusting
further
for
smoking
behavior
the
only
variable
selected
from
a
variety
of
potential
confounders
by
a
forward
stepping
process
with
a
5%
change
in
the
relative
risk
of
CRP
as
the
selection
criterion
yielded
an
HRR
of
150
(95%
CI
114
to
197)
These
results
confirm
the
prognostic
relevance
of
CRP
a
sensitive
systemic
marker
of
inflammation
to
the
risk
of
CHD
in
a
large
randomly
selected
cohort
of
initially
healthy
middle-aged
men
They
suggest
that
low-grade
inflammation
is
involved
in
pathogenesis
of
atherosclerosis
especially
its
thrombo-occlusive
complications
