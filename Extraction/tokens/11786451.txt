Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effects
of
antiplatelet
therapy
among
patients
at
high
risk
of
occlusive
vascular
events
Collaborative
meta-analyses
(systematic
overviews)
Randomised
trials
of
an
antiplatelet
regimen
versus
control
or
of
one
antiplatelet
regimen
versus
another
in
high
risk
patients
(with
acute
or
previous
vascular
disease
or
some
other
predisposing
condition)
from
which
results
were
available
before
September
1997
Trials
had
to
use
a
method
of
randomisation
that
precluded
prior
knowledge
of
the
next
treatment
to
be
allocated
and
comparisons
had
to
be
unconfounded-that
is
have
study
groups
that
differed
only
in
terms
of
antiplatelet
regimen
287
studies
involving
135
000
patients
in
comparisons
of
antiplatelet
therapy
versus
control
and
77
000
in
comparisons
of
different
antiplatelet
regimens
"Serious
vascular
event"
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
non-fatal
stroke
or
vascular
death
Overall
among
these
high
risk
patients
allocation
to
antiplatelet
therapy
reduced
the
combined
outcome
of
any
serious
vascular
event
by
about
one
quarter
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
was
reduced
by
one
third
non-fatal
stroke
by
one
quarter
and
vascular
mortality
by
one
sixth
(with
no
apparent
adverse
effect
on
other
deaths)
Absolute
reductions
in
the
risk
of
having
a
serious
vascular
event
were
36
(SE
5)
per
1000
treated
for
two
years
among
patients
with
previous
myocardial
infarction
38
(5)
per
1000
patients
treated
for
one
month
among
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
36
(6)
per
1000
treated
for
two
years
among
those
with
previous
stroke
or
transient
ischaemic
attack
9
(3)
per
1000
treated
for
three
weeks
among
those
with
acute
stroke
and
22
(3)
per
1000
treated
for
two
years
among
other
high
risk
patients
(with
separately
significant
results
for
those
with
stable
angina
(P=00005)
peripheral
arterial
disease
(P=0004)
and
atrial
fibrillation
(P=001))
In
each
of
these
high
risk
categories
the
absolute
benefits
substantially
outweighed
the
absolute
risks
of
major
extracranial
bleeding
Aspirin
was
the
most
widely
studied
antiplatelet
drug
with
doses
of
75-150
mg
daily
at
least
as
effective
as
higher
daily
doses
The
effects
of
doses
lower
than
75
mg
daily
were
less
certain
Clopidogrel
reduced
serious
vascular
events
by
10%
(4%)
compared
with
aspirin
which
was
similar
to
the
12%
(7%)
reduction
observed
with
its
analogue
ticlopidine
Addition
of
dipyridamole
to
aspirin
produced
no
significant
further
reduction
in
vascular
events
compared
with
aspirin
alone
Among
patients
at
high
risk
of
immediate
coronary
occlusion
short
term
addition
of
an
intravenous
glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa
antagonist
to
aspirin
prevented
a
further
20
(4)
vascular
events
per
1000
(P<00001)
but
caused
23
major
(but
rarely
fatal)
extracranial
bleeds
per
1000
Aspirin
(or
another
oral
antiplatelet
drug)
is
protective
in
most
types
of
patient
at
increased
risk
of
occlusive
vascular
events
including
those
with
an
acute
myocardial
infarction
or
ischaemic
stroke
unstable
or
stable
angina
previous
myocardial
infarction
stroke
or
cerebral
ischaemia
peripheral
arterial
disease
or
atrial
fibrillation
Low
dose
aspirin
(75-150
mg
daily)
is
an
effective
antiplatelet
regimen
for
long
term
use
but
in
acute
settings
an
initial
loading
dose
of
at
least
150
mg
aspirin
may
be
required
Adding
a
second
antiplatelet
drug
to
aspirin
may
produce
additional
benefits
in
some
clinical
circumstances
but
more
research
into
this
strategy
is
needed
