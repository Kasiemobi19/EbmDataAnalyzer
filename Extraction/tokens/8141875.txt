Title
Use
of
antibiotics
in
preventing
recurrent
acute
otitis
media
and
in
treating
otitis
media
with
effusion
A
meta-analytic
attempt
to
resolve
the
brouhaha
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
efficacy
of
antibiotics
for
prophylaxis
of
recurrent
otitis
media
and
treatment
of
otitis
media
with
effusion
(OME)
in
children

Thirty-three
studies
initially
identified
were
reviewed
by
three
blinded
reviewers
assessing
study
quality
and
suitability
for
inclusion
Twenty-seven
met
inclusion
criteria
for
the
meta-analyses
We
abstracted
quantitative
data
and
calculated
rate
differences
(RDs)
using
tympanometry
as
the
preferred
outcome
measure
Nine
studies
of
antibiotic
prophylaxis
of
recurrent
otitis
media
with
958
subjects
had
an
RD
of
011
(95%
confidence
interval
[Cl]
003
to
019)
favoring
antibiotic
treatment
Twelve
studies
of
short-term
patient
outcomes
of
OME
with
1697
subjects
had
an
RD
favoring
antibiotics
of
016
(95%
Cl
003
to
029)
while
eight
studies
using
the
ear
as
the
outcome
measure
with
2052
ears
studied
had
an
RD
of
025
(95%
Cl
010
to
040)
No
significant
difference
was
shown
between
placebo
and
antibiotics
(RD
006
95%
Cl
-003
to
014)
in
the
eight
studies
of
longer-term
outcome
of
OME
Subgroup
analyses
by
antibiotic
grouping
duration
of
treatment
and
duration
of
disease
did
not
show
significant
differences
Antibiotics
appear
to
have
beneficial
but
limited
effect
on
recurrent
otitis
media
and
short-term
resolution
of
OME
Longer-term
benefit
for
OME
has
not
been
shown
The
findings
are
limited
by
the
failure
of
most
studies
to
consider
potential
confounders
and
by
inability
to
identify
groups
of
patients
most
likely
to
benefit
