A
feasibility
study
of
screening
for
endometrial
carcinoma
in
postmenopausal
women
by
ultrasonography
Abstract
Text
Abnormal
endometrial
thickness
assessed
by
ultrasonography
has
been
reported
as
a
reliable
indicator
for
early
asymptomatic
endometrial
carcinoma
We
evaluated
the
feasibility
and
the
performance
of
screening
by
ultrasonography
in
a
consecutive
series
of
postmenopausal
volunteers
A
total
of
2025
women
were
screened
and
117
(58%)
showed
abnormal
endometrial
thickness
Ninety-eight
subjects
consented
to
be
assessed
by
outpatient
endometrial
biopsy
which
was
not
possible
in
32
for
cervical
stenosis
Three
cancers
were
detected
among
66
assessed
subjects
34
not-assessed
subjects
were
controlled
by
repeat
sonography
(no
change)
and
17
were
lost
to
follow-up
No
other
cancer
was
recorded
by
the
local
Cancer
Registry
among
screened
subjects
The
prevalence/incidence
ratio
was
2651
and
the
cost
per
screen-detected
cancer
was
18571000

Screening
by
endometrial
sonography
is
feasible
on
a
practical
basis
but
its
efficacy
needs
to
be
proven
by
prospective
controlled
studies
which
would
enroll
large
populations
to
ensure
sufficient
statistical
power
considering
the
low
incidence
and
the
low
lethality
of
the
disease
Studies
of
screening
for
other
carcinomas
may
be
considered
of
higher
priority
