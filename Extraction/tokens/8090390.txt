Title
Evaluation
of
the
endocervical
Cytobrush
and
Cervex-Brush
in
pregnant
women
Abstract
Text
To
compare
in
pregnant
women
the
endocervical
cell
yield
of
the
Cytobrush
Cell
Collector
and
the
Cervex-Brush
Cell
Sampler
with
the
standard
cotton
swab
and
to
determine
the
incidence
of
serious
adverse
events
associated
with
the
collection
techniques
In
a
randomized
controlled
clinical
trial
352
pregnant
women
undergoing
initial
obstetric
evaluation
were
randomly
assigned
to
either
the
cotton
swab
and
modified
Ayers
spatula
Cytobrush
and
modified
Ayers
spatula
or
Cervex-Brush
The
cytopathology
laboratory
blinded
to
the
Papanicolaou
smear
method
screened
the
smears
using
the
Bethesda
System
guidelines
Statistical
analyses
were
performed
using
the
Pearson
chi
2
and
analysis
of
variance
tests
There
was
an
increased
detection
of
endocervical
cells
in
pregnant
patients
with
both
the
Cytobrush
and
modified
Ayers
spatula
(907%)
and
the
Cervex-Brush
(833%)
methods
compared
with
the
cotton
swab
and
modified
Ayers
spatula
(708%)
(P
=
0001
and
P
=
0233
respectively)
There
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
the
Cytobrush-spatula
and
Cervex-Brush
groups
(P
=
0956)
Although
there
were
more
bloody
Papanicolaou
smears
in
the
study
groups
this
was
neither
clinically
nor
statistically
significant
because
all
the
samples
were
interpretable
and
repeat
samples
due
to
bloody
specimens
were
not
required
There
were
no
serious
adverse
events
associated
with
the
study
group
methods
Performance
of
Papanicolaou
smears
using
the
Cytobrush
and
modified
Ayers
spatula
and
with
the
Cervex-Brush
improved
Papanicolaou
smear
adequacy
as
compared
with
the
cotton
swab
and
modified
Ayers
spatula
Despite
an
increased
incidence
of
spotting
following
collection
these
techniques
were
not
associated
with
an
increase
in
serious
adverse
events
Based
on
the
cost
per
item
and
a
clinically
significant
increase
in
endocervical
cell
yield
we
recommend
the
Cytobrush
and
modified
Ayers
spatula
for
cytologic
screening
in
pregnant
women
