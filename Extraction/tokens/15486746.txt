Thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
outcome
after
conservative
or
surgical
management
Abstract
Text
Few
data
exist
on
the
actual
recurrence
rates
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
We
wished
to
determine
the
incidence
of
recurrence
intervals
to
recurrence
and
factors
predicting
recurrence
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
after
conservative
or
surgical
management
Two
hundred
and
thirty-one
consecutive
patients
with
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
treated
from
1990
to
2002
were
identified
Recurrence
was
defined
as
complete
resolution
of
the
index
lesion
with
subsequent
return
of
a
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoid
and
did
not
include
patients
with
chronic
symptoms
Data
were
gathered
retrospectively
Multiple
potential
risk
factors
were
reviewed
The
index
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoid
was
managed
conservatively
in
515
percent
of
cases
and
surgically
in
485
percent
There
were
no
differences
between
groups
in
gender
age
or
race
and
445
percent
of
all
patients
had
a
prior
history
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoid
A
prior
history
was
less
common
in
the
conservative
group
than
in
the
surgical
group
(381
percent
vs
513
percent
P
<
005)
The
frequency
of
pain
or
bleeding
as
the
primary
complaint
was
higher
in
the
surgical
group
(
P
<
0001
and
P
<
0002)
In
addition
the
surgical
group
was
more
likely
to
report
all
three
symptoms
of
pain
bleeding
and
a
lump
(
P
<
0005)
Mean
follow-up
was
76
months
with
the
range
extending
to
7
years
Time
to
symptom
resolution
averaged
24
days
in
the
conservative
group
vs
39
days
in
the
surgical
group
(
P
<
00001)
The
overall
incidence
to
recurrence
was
156
percent-806
percent
in
the
conservative
group
vs
194
percent
in
the
surgical
group
The
rate
of
recurrence
in
the
conservative
group
was
254
percent
(4/29
14
percent
were
excised)
whereas
only
63
percent
of
the
surgical
patients
had
recurrence
(
P
<
00001)
Mean
time
to
recurrence
was
71
months
in
the
conservative
group
vs
25
months
in
the
surgical
group
(
P
<
00001)
Survival
analysis
for
time
to
recurrence
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoid
indicated
that
time
to
recurrence
was
significantly
longer
for
the
surgical
group
(
P
<
00001)
Logistic
regression
analysis
of
multiple
factors
(including
diverticular
disease
constipation
straining
benign
prostatic
hypertrophy
diarrhea
skin
tags
history
of
travel
anoreceptive
sex
anal
fissures
internal
hemorrhoids
and
obesity)
was
performed
to
determine
the
outcome
of
each
group
None
of
these
variables
were
significant
predictors
of
recurrence
Patients
whose
initial
presentation
was
pain
or
bleeding
with
or
without
a
lump
were
more
like
to
be
treated
surgically
Surgically
treated
patients
had
a
lower
frequency
of
recurrence
and
a
longer
time
interval
to
recurrence
than
conservatively
treated
patients
None
of
the
variables
analyzed
were
significant
predictors
of
a
particular
treatment
except
for
a
prior
history
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
which
may
represent
patient
choice
Although
most
patients
treated
conservatively
will
experience
resolution
of
their
symptoms
excision
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
results
in
more
rapid
symptom
resolution
lower
incidence
of
recurrence
and
longer
remission
intervals
