Abstract
Text
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
such
as
captopril
reduce
mortality
and
cardiovascular
morbidity
among
patients
with
myocardial
infarction
complicated
by
left
ventricular
systolic
dysfunction
heart
failure
or
both
In
a
double-blind
trial
we
compared
the
effect
of
the
angiotensin-receptor
blocker
valsartan
the
ACE
inhibitor
captopril
and
the
combination
of
the
two
on
mortality
in
this
population
of
patients
Patients
receiving
conventional
therapy
were
randomly
assigned
05
to
10
days
after
acute
myocardial
infarction
to
additional
therapy
with
valsartan
(4909
patients)
valsartan
plus
captopril
(4885
patients)
or
captopril
(4909
patients)
The
primary
end
point
was
death
from
any
cause
During
a
median
follow-up
of
247
months
979
patients
in
the
valsartan
group
died
as
did
941
patients
in
the
valsartan-and-captopril
group
and
958
patients
in
the
captopril
group
(hazard

the

the
captopril

The
upper
limit
of
the
one-sided
975
percent
confidence
interval
for
the
comparison
of
the
valsartan
group
with
the
captopril
group
was
within
the
prespecified
margin
for
noninferiority
with
regard
to
mortality
(P=0004)
and
with
regard
to
the
composite
end
point
of
fatal
and
nonfatal
cardiovascular
events
(P<0001)
The
valsartan-and-captopril
group
had
the
most
drug-related
adverse
events
With
monotherapy
hypotension
and
renal
dysfunction
were
more
common
in
the
valsartan
group
and
cough
rash
and
taste
disturbance
were
more
common
in
the
captopril
group
Valsartan
is
as
effective
as
captopril
in
patients
who
are
at
high
risk
for
cardiovascular
events
after
myocardial
infarction
Combining
valsartan
with
captopril
increased
the
rate
of
adverse
events
without
improving
survival
