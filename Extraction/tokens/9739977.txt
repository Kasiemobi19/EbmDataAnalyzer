Exercise
echocardiography
or
exercise
SPECT
imaging
A
meta-analysis
of
diagnostic
test
performance
Abstract
Text
Cardiac
imaging
has
advanced
rapidly
providing
clinicians
with
several
choices
for
evaluating
patients
with
suspected
coronary
artery
disease
but
few
studies
compare
modalities
directly
To
review
the
contemporary
literature
and
to
compare
the
diagnostic
performance
of
exercise
echocardiography
(ECHO)
and
exercise
single-photon
emission
computed
tomography
(SPECT)
imaging
in
the
diagnosis
of
coronary
artery
disease
Studies
published
between
January
1990
and
October
1997
identified
from
MEDLINE
search
bibliographies
of
reviews
and
original
articles
and
suggestions
from
experts
in
each
area
Articles
were
included
if
they
discussed
exercise
ECHO
and/or
exercise
SPECT
imaging
with
thallous
chloride
TI
201
(thallium)
or
technetium
Tc
99m
sestamibi
for
detection
and/or
evaluation
of
coronary
artery
disease
if
data
on
coronary
angiography
were
presented
as
the
reference
test
and
if
the
absolute
numbers
of
true-positive
false-negative
true-negative
and
false-positive
observations
were
available
or
derivable
from
the
data
presented
Studies
performed
exclusively
in
patients
after
myocardial
infarction
after
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
after
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
or
with
recent
unstable
coronary
syndromes
were
excluded
Clinical
variables
technical
factors
and
test
performance
were
independently
extracted
by
2
reviewers
on
a
standardized
spreadsheet
Discrepancies
were
resolved
by
consensus
Forty-four
articles
met
inclusion
criteria
In
pooled
data
weighted
by
the
sample
size
of
each
study
exercise
ECHO
had
a
sensitivity
of
85%
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
83%-87%)
with
a
specificity
of
77%
(95%
CI
74%-80%)
Exercise
SPECT
yielded
a
similar
sensitivity
of
87%
(95%
CI
86%-88%)
but
a
lower
specificity
of
64%
(95%
CI
60%-68%)
In
a
summary
receiver
operating
characteristic
model
comparing
exercise
ECHO
performance
to
exercise
SPECT
exercise
ECHO
was
associated
with
significantly
better
discriminatory
power
(parameter
estimate
118
95%
CI
071-165)
when
adjusted
for
age
publication
year
and
a
setting
including
known
coronary
artery
disease
for
SPECT
studies
In
models
comparing
the
discriminatory
abilities
of
exercise
ECHO
and
exercise
SPECT
vs
exercise
testing
without
imaging
both
ECHO
and
SPECT
performed
significantly
better
than
exercise
testing
The
incremental
improvement
in
performance
was
greater
for
ECHO
(343
95%
CI
274-411)
than
for
SPECT
(149
95%
CI
091-208)
Exercise
ECHO
and
exercise
SPECT
have
similar
sensitivities
for
the
detection
of
coronary
artery
disease
but
exercise
ECHO
has
better
specificity
and
therefore
higher
overall
discriminatory
capabilities
as
used
in
contemporary
practice
