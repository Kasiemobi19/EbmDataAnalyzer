Solitary
pulmonary
nodule
diagnosis
on
CT
results
of
an
observer
study
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
performance
of
observers
with
different
levels
of
experience
in
distinguishing
between
benign
and
malignant
solitary
pulmonary
nodules
(SPN)
on
CT
and
to
determine
the
effects
on
interpretation
of
three
different
conditions
image
data
alone
the
addition
of
clinical
data
and
the
addition
of
output
from
a
computer-aided
diagnosis
(CAD)
system
28
thin-section
CT
datasets
of
SPNs
with
proven
diagnoses
(15
malignant
and
13
benign)
were
used
to
measure
observer
performance
Readers
were
categorized
according
to
their
experience
and
read
the
cases
in
random
order
For
each
case
readers
were
asked
to
assign
a
level
of
confidence
on
a
scale
from
00-10
(00
benign
10
malignant)
for
the
diagnosis
of
the
nodule
Each
reader
scored
the
cases
based
on
review
of
image
data
alone
(phase
1)
then
with
limited
clinical
data
(phase
2)
and
finally
with
CAD
output
(phase
3)
To
assess
performance
multiple
reader
multiple
case
(MRMC)
receiver
operating
characteristic
(ROC)
analysis
was
used

2
thoracic
radiologists
1
thoracic
radiology
fellow
2
nonthoracic
radiologists
and
3
radiology
residents
read
the
cases
The
average
area
under
the
ROC
curve
for
all
readers
(A(z))
at
each
stage
was
068
075
and
081
for
image
data
alone
with
clinical
data
and
with
CAD
output
respectively
The
difference
in
performance
between
phases
(2
and
3)
and
(1
and
3)
was
significantly
different
(P
=
0018
and
P
=
0020)
However
the
difference
between
phases
(1
and
2)
was
not
significantly
different
(P
=
0155)
Diagnostic
performance
increased
significantly
with
the
addition
of
CAD
output
With
further
validation
CAD
output
may
play
a
significant
role
in
SPN
management
