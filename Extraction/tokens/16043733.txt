Title
Efficacy
of
inhaled
insulin
in
patients
with
type

diabetes
not
controlled
with
diet
and

a
12-week
randomized

trial
Abstract
Text
Effective
type
2
diabetes
management
requires
prompt
intervention
if
glycemic
control
is
not
achieved
by
nonpharmacological
means
This
study
investigates
whether
inhaled
insulin
(INH
Exubera)
can
achieve
target
glycemic
control
in
patients
failing
on
diet
and
exercise
Patients
with
suboptimal
control
on
diet
and
exercise
(HbA(1c)
[A1C]
8-11%)
were
randomized
to
3
months'
treatment
with
either
INH
before
meals
(n
=
76)
or
rosiglitazone
4
mg
twice
a
day
(n
=
69)
in
conjunction
with
a
diet
and
exercise
regimen
The
primary
end
point
was
percentage
of
patients
achieving
A1C
<80%
The
INH
and
rosiglitazone
groups
had
comparable
baseline
A1C
values
(95
vs
94%
respectively)
Significantly
more
patients
achieved
A1C
<80%
(83
vs
58%
adjusted
odds
ratio
714
[95%
CI
248-2058]
P
=
00003)
A1C
<70%
(44
vs
18%
443
[194-1012])
and
A1C
<
or
=
65%
(28
vs
75%
534
[183-1557])
with
INH
A1C
decrease
was
greater
with
INH
(-23%
vs
-14%
adjusted
treatment
group
difference
-089%
[95%
CI
-123
to
-055])
with
final
mean
A1C
values
of
72
and
80%
for
INH
and
rosiglitazone
respectively
Hypoglycemia
(episodes
per
subject-month)
was
higher
with
INH
(07
vs
005
risk
ratio
1472
[95%
CI
751-2883])
with
no
severe
hypoglycemic
episodes
Pulmonary
function
changes
were
small
and
comparable
between
groups
INH
could
be
an
effective
therapy
for
people
with
type
2
diabetes
early
in
the
course
of
their
disease
