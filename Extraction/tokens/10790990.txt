Treatment

Abstract
Text
To
determine
(a)
the
long-term
and
short-term
effectiveness
and
safety
of
pharmacological
and
nonpharmacological
interventions
for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
in
children
and
adults
and
(b)
whether
combined
interventions
are
more
effective
than
individual
interventions
MEDLINE
(from
1966)
CINAHL
(from
1982)
HEALTHStar
(from
1975)
PsycINFO
(from
1984)
EMBASE
(from
1984)
and
the
Cochrane
Library
searches
were
completed
in
November
1997
Reference
lists
of
eligible
studies
and
files
of
members
of
the
research
team
and
partner
organizations
were
also
searched
Studies
were
selected
if
they
focused
on
the
treatment
of
ADHD
in
humans
and
were
published
in
any
language
as
a
full
report
in
peer-reviewed
journals
Studies
including
conditions
other
than
ADHD
were
reported
if
separate
subgroup
analyses
for
patients
with
ADHD
were
provided
Two
reviewers
independently
extracted
data
for
41
variables
on
general
characteristics
along
with
detailed
information
on
interventions
outcomes
and
tests
Differences
were
resolved
by
consensus
or
by
a
third
researcher
Studies
were
not
combined
quantitatively
because
the
quality
of
reporting
was
low
and
heterogeneity
existed
across
outcome
measures
and
tests
Seventy-eight
studies
(77
randomized
controlled
trials)
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Twenty-three
studies
compared
drugs
and
showed
few
if
any
differences
among
methylphenidate
(MPH)
dextroamphetamine
(DEX)
and
pemoline
studies
comparing
stimulants
with
tricyclic
antidepressants
(2)
were
inconclusive
Six
studies
compared
drugs
with
nondrug
interventions
and
showed
consistently
that
stimulants
particularly
MPH
may
be
more
effective
than
nonpharmacological
interventions
Twenty
studies
compared
combination
therapies
with
a
stimulant
or
a
nondrug
intervention
alone
no
additional
beneficial
effects
for
combination
therapies
were
shown
Nine
studies
compared
tricyclic
antidepressants
with
placebo
and
showed
that
desipramine
may
be
more
effective
than
placebo
no
consistent
effect
was
shown
for
imipramine
Fourteen
studies
(13
in
school
children
and
1
in
adults)
evaluated
long-term
therapy
(>
or
=
12
weeks)
and
showed
a
trend
to
general
improvement
regardless
of
treatment
but
the
length
of
followup
was
inadequate
MPH
may
reduce
behavioral
disturbance
in
children
with
ADHD
while
it
is
taken
Academic
performance
does
not
appear
to
be
improved
with
stimulants
Twelve
studies
evaluated
treatment
in
adults
with
ADHD
For
MPH
vs
placebo
the
results
were
contradictory
Antidepressants
may
be
effective
in
adults
but
no
beneficial
effect
was
seen
with
pemoline
nicotine
or
phenylalanine
compared
with
placebo
Thirty-two
reports
(29
studies)
evaluated
adverse
effects
of
drug
therapy
many
of
the
side
effects
associated
with
stimulant
use
appear
to
be
relatively
mild
and
of
short
duration
and
to
respond
to
dosing
or
timing
adjustments
Data
are
inadequate
on
the
long-term
effects
and
severity
of
adverse
effects
of
most
interventions
This
report
describes
rigorous
systematic
reviews
on
the
treatment
of
ADHD
ready
for
incorporation
into
evidence-based
clinical
practice
guidelines
or
performance
measures
The
report
also
provides
a
detailed
description
of
the
many
limitations
of
the
evidence
available
and
provides
recommendations
to
fill
existing
knowledge
gaps
Studies
on
ADHD
have
low
reporting
quality
methodological
flaws
and
heterogeneity
across
outcome
measures
and
tests
A
detailed
description
is
included
of
the
many
limitations
of
the
available
evidence
plus
recommendations
to
fill
existing
knowledge
gaps
Fulfilling
such
knowledge
gaps
will
not
be
easy
and
will
require
genuine
collaboration
among
decisionmakers
