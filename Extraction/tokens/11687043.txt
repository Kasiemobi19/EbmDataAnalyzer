Title
Statins
for
the
reduction
of
risk
of
Alzheimer's
disease
Abstract
Text

Two
recent
clinical
reports
describe
an
association
between
statin
therapy
and
a
reduction
in
the
occurrence
of
Alzheimer's
disease
by
as
much
as
70
%
One
report
is
a
cross-sectional
analysis
of
discharges
among
three
hospitals
and
the
other
is
a
nested
case
control
study
drawn
from
ambulatory
patients
of
general
practitioners
in
the
UK
Because
neither
study
is
a
randomized
trial
the
association
noted
between
statin
therapy
and
a
reduced
incidence
of
Alzheimer's
disease
may
have
occurred
because
other
factors
unaccounted
for
in
the
studies
may
be
present
(so
called
bias)
and
be
responsible
for
the
observed
association
However
there
is
an
expanding
body
of
biological
and
epidemiological
data
that
makes
it
plausible
that
statin
therapy
may
retard
or
prevent
the
pathogenesis
and
clinical
expression
of
Alzheimer's
disease
This
review
was
initiated
in
order
to
find
other
clinical
evidence
that
might
support
or
refute
the
hypothesized
benefit
of
statin
therapy

The
purpose
is
to
review
the
evidence
that
treatment
with
statins
reduces
the
risk
of
Alzheimer's
disease

The
following
data
bases
were
searched

In
order
to
be
selected
trials
needed
to
be
randomized
doubled
blinded
and
of
sufficient
duration(
probably
years
rather
than
weeks
or
months)
to
ascertain
the
preventive
potential
of
statin
therapy

Data
were
to
be
extracted
independently
by
two
reviewers
and
pooled
where
appropriate
and
possible
The
pooled
odds
ratios
(95%
CI)
or
the
average
differences
were
to
be
estimated

There
were
no
randomized
trials
found
in
the
search

There
is
no
good
evidence
to
recommend
statins
for
reducing
the
risk
of
Alzheimer's
disease
There
is
however
a
growing
body
of
biological
epidemiological
and
limited
but
non-randomized
clinical
evidence
that
lowering
serum
cholesterol
may
retard
the
pathogenesis
of
Alzheimer's
disease
Mounting
the
clinical
studies
to
determine
the
potential
benefit
of
statin
therapy
should
be
a
high
priority
for
future
research
agendas
