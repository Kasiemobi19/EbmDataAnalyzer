Abstract
Text
The
procedure
for
prolapse
and
hemorrhoids
(stapled
hemorrhoidopexy)
has
been
introduced
as
an
alternative
to
conventional
hemorrhoidectomy
This
is
a
systematic
review
on
stapled
hemorrhoidopexy
of
all
randomized
controlled
trials
that
have
been
published
until
August
2006
All
published
randomized
controlled
trials
comparing
stapled
hemorrhoidopexy
to
conventional
hemorrhoidectomy
were
identified
from
Ovid
MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
and
all

Reviews
(Cochrane

of

and

between
January
1991
and
August
2006
Meta-analysis
was
performed
by
using
the
Forest
plot
review
if
feasible
A
total
of
25
randomized
controlled
trials
with
1918
procedures
were
reviewed
The
follow-up
duration
was
from
1
to
62
months
Stapled
hemorrhoidopexy
was
associated
with
less
operating
time
(weighted
mean
difference
-1135
minutes
P
=
0006)
earlier
return
of
bowel
function
(weighted
mean
difference
-991
hours
P
<
000001)
and
shorter
hospital
stay
(weighted
mean
difference
-107
days
P
=
00004)
There
was
less
pain
after
stapled
hemorrhoidopexy
as
evidenced
by
lower
pain
scores
at
rest
and
on
defecation
and
376
percent
reduction
in
analgesic
requirement
The
stapled
hemorrhoidopexy
allowed
a
faster
functional
recovery
with
shorter
time
off
work
(weighted
mean
difference
-845
days
P
<
000001)
earlier
return
to
normal
activities
(weighted
mean
difference
-1585
days
P
=
003)
and
better
wound
healing
(odds
ratio
01
P
=
00006)
The
patients'
satisfaction
was
significantly
higher
with
stapled
hemorrhoidopexy
than
conventional
hemorrhoidectomy
(odds
ratio
233
P
=
0003)
Although
there
was
increase
in
the
recurrence
of
hemorrhoids
at
one
year
or
more
after
stapled
procedure
(57
vs
1
percent
odds
ratio
348
P
=
002)
the
overall
incidence
of
recurrent
hemorrhoidal
symptoms--early
(fewer
than
6
months
stapled
vs
conventional
248
vs
317
percent
P
=
008)
or
late
(1
year
or
more)
recurrence
rate
(stapled
vs
conventional
253
vs
187
percent
P
=
007)--was
similar
The
overall
complication
rate
did
not
differ
significantly
from
that
of
conventional
procedure
(stapled
vs
conventional
202
vs
252
percent
P
=
006)
Compared
with
conventional
surgery
stapled
hemorrhoidopexy
has
less
postoperative
bleeding
(odds
ratio
052
P
=
0001)
wound
complication
(odds
ratio
005
P
=
0005)
constipation
(odds
ratio
045
P
=
002)
and
pruritus
(odds
ratio
019
P
=
002)
The
overall
need
of
surgical
(odds
ratio
127
P
=
04)
and
nonsurgical
(odds
ratio
107
P
=
082)
reintervention
after
the
two
procedures
was
similar
The
Procedure
for
Prolapse
and
Hemorrhoid
(stapled
hemorrhoidopexy)
is
safe
with
many
short-term
benefits
The
long-term
results
are
similar
to
conventional
procedure
