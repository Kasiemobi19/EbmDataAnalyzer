Text
To
evaluate
the
incidence
and
risk
factors
for
clinically
important
upper
gastrointestinal
bleeding
in
critically
ill
patients
requiring
mechanical
ventilation
In
duplicate
blinded
adjudicators
determined
the
presence
of
clinically
important
gastrointestinal
bleeding
using
a
priori
criteria
evaluating
relevant
clinical
laboratory
and
diagnostic
data
Cox
proportional
hazards
regression
analyses
were
used
to
examine
baseline
and
time-dependent
risk
factors
for
bleeding
Sixteen
university-affiliated
intensive
care
units
(ICUs)
in
Canada
A
total
of
1077
critically
ill
ICU
patients
ventilated
for
at
least
48
hrs
Patients
were
randomized
to
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
with
intravenous
ranitidine
or
nasogastric
sucralfate
otherwise
management
was
at
the
discretion
of
the
ICU
team
Demographic
data
included
patient
characteristics
Acute
Physiology
and
Chronic
Health
Evaluation
II
score
and
multiple
organ
dysfunction
(MOD)
score
Each
day
in
the
ICU
physiologic
measurements
including
MOD
score
feeding
and
other
treatment
variables
were
recorded
The
significant
risk
factors
for
upper
gastrointestinal
bleeding
in
the
univariable
analyses
were
low
platelet
count
maximum
serum
creatinine
maximum
MOD
score
maximum
pulmonary
component
of
the
MOD
score
maximum
hepatic
component
of
the
MOD
score
maximum
renal
component
of
the
MOD
score
enteral
nutrition
and
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
with
ranitidine
The
only
independent
predictors
of
bleeding
in
the
multivariable
analysis
were
maximum
serum
creatinine
(relative
risk
=
116
[95%
confidence
interval
=
102-132])
enteral
nutrition
(relative
risk
=
030
[95%
confidence
interval
=
013-067])
and
ranitidine
administration
(relative
risk
=
039
[95%
confidence
interval
=
017-083])
In
critically
ill
ventilated
patients
renal
failure
was
independently
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
clinically
important
gastrointestinal
bleeding
whereas
enteral
nutrition
and
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
with
ranitidine
conferred
significantly
lower
bleeding
rates
