Practice
Parameters
for
the
Assessment
and
Treatment
of
Children
and
Adolescents
with
Depressive
Disorders
Depressive
disorders
in
children
and
adolescents
are
marked
by
core
symptoms
similar
to
those
seen
in
adults
although
symptom
expression
varies
greatly
with
developmental
stage
These
disorders
are
common
chronic
and
recurrent
and
they
are
associated
with
comorbid
psychiatric
conditions
and
poor
outcome
that
can
be
alleviated
by
early
identification
and
treatment
Opinions
differ
regarding
treatment
planning
and
duration
of
treatment
required
Development
of
a
treatment
relationship
with
the
patient
and
family
is
crucial
for
a
successful
outcome
Psychotherapy
is
an
appropriate
treatment
for
all
children
and
adolescents
with
depressive
disorders
Antidepressants
may
prove
useful
in
some
cases
and
are
especially
recommended
for
patients
with
psychosis
bipolar
depression
and
severe
depression
Continuation
treatment
is
necessary
in
all
patients
after
the
acute
phase
long-term
maintenance
is
required
in
some
Early
detection
and
intervention
is
effective
in
ameliorating
the
poor
psychosocial
outcome
