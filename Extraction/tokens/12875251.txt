Abstract
Text
Reducing
transmission
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)
in
the
United
States
requires
new
strategies
including
emphasis
on
prevention
of
transmission
by
HIV-infected
persons
Through
ongoing
attention
to
prevention
risky
sexual
and
needle-sharing
behaviors
among
persons
with
HIV
infection
can
be
reduced
and
transmission
of
HIV
infection
prevented
Medical
care
providers
can
substantially
affect
HIV
transmission
by
screening
their
HIV-infected
patients
for
risk
behaviors
communicating
prevention
messages
discussing
sexual
and
drug-use
behavior
positively
reinforcing
changes
to
safer
behavior
referring
patients
for
services
such
as
substance
abuse
treatment
facilitating
partner
notification
counseling
and
testing
and
identifying
and
treating
other
sexually
transmitted
diseases
(STDs)
To
help
incorporate
HIV
prevention
into
the
medical
care
of
HIV-infected
persons
CDC
the
Health
Resources
and
Services
Administration
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
and
the
HIV
Medicine
Association
of
the
Infectious
Diseases
Society
of
America
developed
these
recommendations
The
recommendations
are
general
and
apply
to
incorporating
HIV
prevention
into
the
medical
care
of
all
HIV-infected
adolescents
and
adults
regardless
of
age
sex
or
race/ethnicity
They
are
intended
for
all
persons
who
provide
medical
care
to
HIV-infected
persons
(eg
physicians
nurse
practitioners
nurses
physician
assistants)
they
might
also
be
useful
to
those
who
deliver
prevention
messages
(eg
case
managers
social
workers
health
educators)
The
recommendations
were
developed
by
using
an
evidence-based
approach
For
each
recommendation
the
strength
of
the
recommendation
the
quality
of
available
evidence
supporting
the
recommendation
and
the
outcome
for
which
the
recommendation
is
rated
are
provided
The
recommendations
are
categorized
into
three
major
components
screening
for
HIV
transmission
risk
behaviors
and
STDs
providing
brief
behavioral
risk-reduction
interventions
in
the
office
setting
and
referring
selected
patients
for
additional
prevention
interventions
and
other
related
services
and
facilitating
notification
and
counseling
of
sex
and
needle-sharing
partners
of
infected
persons
