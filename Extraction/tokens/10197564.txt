Abstract
Text
Plasma
lipid
and
lipoprotein
responses
have
been
variable
in
dietary
intervention
studies
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
the
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program's
Step
I
and
Step
II
dietary
interventions
on
major
cardiovascular
disease
risk
factors
using
meta-analysis
MEDLINE
was
used
to
select
37
dietary
intervention
studies
in
free-living
subjects
published
from
1981
to
1997
Step
I
and
Step
II
dietary
interventions
significantly
decreased
plasma
lipids
and
lipoproteins
Plasma
total
cholesterol
(TC)
LDL
cholesterol
triacylglycerol
and
TCHDL
cholesterol
decreased
by
063
mmol/L
(10%)
049
mmol/L
(12%)
017
mmol/L
(8%)
and
050
(10%)
respectively
in
Step
I
intervention
studies
and
by
081
mmol/L
(13%)
065
mmol/L
(16%)
019
mmol/L
(8%)
and
034
(7%)
respectively
in
Step
II
intervention
studies
(P
<
001
for
all)
HDL
cholesterol
decreased
by
7%
(P
=
005)
in
response
to
Step
II
but
not
to
Step
I
dietary
interventions
Positive
correlations
between
changes
in
dietary
total
and
saturated
fatty
acids
and
changes
in
TC
and
LDL
and
HDL
cholesterol
were
observed
(r
=
059
061
and
046
respectively
P
<
0001)
Multiple
regression
analyses
showed
that
for
every
1%
decrease
in
energy
consumed
as
dietary
saturated
fatty
acid
TC
decreased
by
0056
mmol/L
and
LDL
cholesterol
by
005
mmol/L
Moreover
for
every
1-kg
decrease
in
body
weight
triacylglycerol
decreased
by
0011
mmol/L
and
HDL
cholesterol
increased
by
0011
mmol/L
Exercise
resulted
in
greater
decreases
in
TC
LDL
cholesterol
and
triacylglycerol
and
prevented
the
decrease
in
HDL
cholesterol
associated
with
low-fat
diets
Step
I
and
Step
II
dietary
interventions
have
multiple
beneficial
effects
on
important
cardiovascular
disease
risk
factors
