Abstract
Text
Recognition
that
psychological
and
behavioral
factors
play
an
important
role
in
insomnia
has
led
to
increased
interest
in
therapies
targeting
these
factors
A
review
paper
published
in
1999
summarized
the
evidence
regarding
the
efficacy
of
psychological
and
behavioral
treatments
for
persistent
insomnia
The
present
review
provides
an
update
of
the
evidence
published
since
the
original
paper
As
with
the
original
paper
this
review
was
conducted
by
a
task
force
commissioned
by
the
American
Academy
of
Sleep
Medicine
in
order
to
update
its
practice
parameters
on
psychological
and
behavioral
therapies
for
insomnia
A
systematic
review
was
conducted
on
37
treatment
studies
(N
=
2246
subjects/patients)
published
between
1998
and
2004
inclusively
and
identified
through
Psyclnfo
and
Medline
searches
Each
study
was
systematically
reviewed
with
a
standard
coding
sheet
and
the
following
information
was
extracted
Study
design
sample
(number
of
participants
age
gender)
diagnosis
type
of
treatments
and
controls
primary
and
secondary
outcome
measures
and
main
findings
Criteria
for
inclusion
of
a
study
were
as
follows
(a)
the
main
sleep
diagnosis
was
insomnia
(primary
or
comorbid)
(b)
at
least
1
treatment
condition
was
psychological
or
behavioral
in
content
(c)
the
study
design
was
a
randomized
controlled
trial
a
nonrandomized
group
design
a
clinical
case
series
or
a
single
subject
experimental
design
with
a
minimum
of
10
subjects
and
(d)
the
study
included
at
least
1
of
the
following
as
dependent
variables
sleep
onset
latency
number
and/or
duration
of
awakenings
total
sleep
time
sleep
efficiency
or
sleep
quality
Psychological
and
behavioral
therapies
produced
reliable
changes
in
several
sleep
parameters
of
individuals
with
either
primary
insomnia
or
insomnia
associated
with
medical
and
psychiatric
disorders
Nine
studies
documented
the
benefits
of
insomnia
treatment
in
older
adults
or
for
facilitating
discontinuation
of
medication
among
chronic
hypnotic
users
Sleep
improvements
achieved
with
treatment
were
well
sustained
over
time
however
with
the
exception
of
reduced
psychological
symptoms/
distress
there
was
limited
evidence
that
improved
sleep
led
to
clinically
meaningful
changes
in
other
indices
of
morbidity
(eg
daytime
fatigue)
Five
treatments
met
criteria
for
empirically-supported
psychological
treatments
for
insomnia
Stimulus
control
therapy
relaxation
paradoxical
intention
sleep
restriction
and
cognitive-behavior
therapy
These
updated
findings
provide
additional
evidence
in
support
of
the
original
review's
conclusions
as
to
the
efficacy
and
generalizability
of
psychological
and
behavioral
therapies
for
persistent
insomnia
Nonetheless
further
research
is
needed
to
develop
therapies
that
would
optimize
outcomes
and
reduce
morbidity
as
would
studies
of
treatment
mechanisms
mediators
and
moderators
of
outcomes
Effectiveness
studies
are
also
needed
to
validate
those
therapies
when
implemented
in
clinical
settings
(primary
care)
by
non-sleep
specialists
There
is
also
a
need
to
disseminate
more
effectively
the
available
evidence
in
support
of
psychological
and
behavioral
interventions
to
health-care
practitioners
working
on
the
front
line
