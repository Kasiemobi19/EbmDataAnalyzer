Randomised
trial
of
alpha-tocopherol
and
beta-carotene
supplements
on
incidence
of
major
coronary
events
in
men
with
previous
myocardial
infarction
Abstract
Text
Epidemiological
data
suggest
that
the
intake
of
antioxidants
such
as
alpha-tocopherol
(vitamin
E)
and
beta-carotene
has
an
inverse
correlation
with
the
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
The
results
from
clinical
trials
of
antioxidant
supplementation
in
people
with
known
coronary
heart
disease
are
inconclusive
We
studied
the
frequency
of
major
coronary
events
in
1862
men
enrolled
in
the
alpha-tocopherol
beta-carotene
Cancer
Prevention
Study
(smokers
aged
between
50
and
69
years)
who
had
a
previous
myocardial
infarction
In
this
randomised
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
men
had
received
dietary
supplements
of
alpha-tocopherol
(50
mg/day)
beta-carotene
(20
mg/day)
both
or
placebo
The
median
follow-up
was
53
years
The
endpoint
of
this
substudy
was
the
first
major
coronary
event
after
randomisation
Analyses
were
by
intention
to
treat
424
major
coronary
events
(non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
and
fatal
coronary
heart
disease)
occurred
during
follow-up
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
number
of
major
coronary
events
between
any
supplementation
group
and
the
placebo
group
(alpha-tocopherol
94/466
beta-carotene
113/461
alpha-tocopherol
and
beta-carotene
123/497
placebo
94/438
[log-rank
test
p
=
025])
There
were
significantly
more
deaths
from
fatal
coronary
heart
disease
in
the
beta-carotene
(74/461
multivariate-adjusted
relative
risk
175
[95%
CI
116-264]
p
=
0007)
and
combined
alpha-tocopherol
and
beta-carotene
groups
(67/497
relative
risk
158
[105-240]
p
=
003)
than
in
the
placebo
group
(39/438)
but
there
was
no
significant
increase
in
the
alpha-tocopherol
supplementation
group
(54/466
relative
risk
133
[086-205]
p
=
020)
The
proportion
of
major
coronary
events
in
men
with
a
previous
myocardial
infarction
who
smoke
was
not
decreased
with
either
alpha-tocopherol
or
beta-carotene
supplements
In
fact
the
risk
of
fatal
coronary
heart
disease
increased
in
the
groups
that
received
either
beta-carotene
or
the
combination
of
alpha-tocopherol
and
beta-carotene
there
was
a
non-significant
trend
of
increased
deaths
in
the
alpha-tocopherol
group
We
do
not
recommend
the
use
of
alpha-tocopherol
or
beta-carotene
supplements
in
this
group
of
patients
