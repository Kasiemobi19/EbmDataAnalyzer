The
efficacy
of
traction
for
back
and
neck
pain
a
systematic
blinded
review
of
randomized
clinical
trial
methods
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
conduct
a
systematic
analysis
of
the
literature
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
traction
for
patients
with
neck
or
back
pain
For
this
purpose
randomized
clinical
trials
comparing
traction
with
other
treatments
were
selected
A
computer-aided
search
of
the
literature
was
conducted
for
relevant
articles
followed
by
blinded
assessment
of
the
methods
of
the
studies
The
main
outcome
measures
were
(1)
scoring
for
quality
of
the
designated
conduct
of
studies
(based
on
a
methodological
checklist
with
four
main
categories
study
population
interventions
measurement
of
effect
and
data
presentation)
and
the
main
conclusions
of
author(s)
with
regard
to
traction
and
(2)
calculation
of
confidence
intervals
and
power
of
the
studies
Only
three
studies
scored
more
than
50
points
(maximum
score
=
100
points)
suggesting
that
most
of
the
selected
studies
were
of
poor
quality
None
of
these
three
studies
showed
favorable
results
for
traction
Only
four
studies
of
which
one
scored
more
than
50
points
had
an
acceptable
power
(1-
beta
>
80%)
The
available
reports
of
studies
on
the
efficacy
of
traction
for
back
and
neck
pain
do
not
allow
clear
conclusions
due
to
the
methodological
flaws
in
their
design
and
conduct
Most
studies
lacked
power
(1-beta)
due
to
small
sample
sizes
To
date
no
conclusions
can
be
drawn
about
whether
a
specific
traction
modality
for
back
or
neck
pain
is
effective
or
more
efficacious
than
other
treatments
There
are
no
clear
indications
however
that
traction
is
an
ineffective
therapy
for
back
and
neck
pain
Further
trials
are
needed
in
which
much
more
attention
should
be
paid
to
proper
design
and
conduct
as
well
as
to
clear
descriptions
of
crucial
methodological
features
and
results
