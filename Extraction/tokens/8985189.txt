Abstract
Text
Vaccination
of
health
care
workers
(HCWs)
is
recommended
as
a
strategy
for
preventing
influenza
in
elderly
patients
in
long-term
care
However
there
have
been
no
controlled
studies
to
show
whether
this
approach
is
effective
During
the
winter
of
1994-1995
1059
patients
in
12
geriatric
medical
long-term-care
sites
randomized
for
vaccination
of
HCWs
were
studied
In
hospitals
where
HCWs
were
offered
vaccination
653
(61%)
of
1078
were
vaccinated
Vaccination
of
HCWs
was
associated
with
reductions
in
total
patient
mortality
from
17%
to
10%
(odds
ratio
[OR]
056
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
040-080)
and
in
influenza-like
illness
(OR
057
95%
CI
034-094)
Vaccination
of
patients
was
not
associated
with
significant
effects
on
mortality
(OR
115
95%
CI
081-164)
Results
of
this
study
support
recommendations
for
vaccination
against
influenza
of
HCWs
in
long-term
geriatric
care
Vaccination
of
frail
elderly
long-term-care
patients
may
not
give
clinically
worthwhile
benefits
