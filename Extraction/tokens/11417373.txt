Nocturnal
leg
cramps
Clinically
mysterious
and
painful--but
manageable
Abstract
Text
Nocturnal
leg
cramps
are
common
occurrences
among
older
generally
healthy
adults
Although
there
are
many
known
causes--endocrinologic
neurologic
and
vascular
disorders
treatment
with
certain
drugs
and
occupational
factors--a
significant
portion
of
cases
are
idiopathic
History
physical
exam
and
laboratory
testing
can
provide
clues
for
distinguishing
between
cramps
with
identifiable
causes
and
idiopathic
cases
For
nonidiopathic
cases
management
consists
of
treating
the
underlying
cause
whenever
possible
A
nonpharmacologic
approach
(massaging
and
stretching)
is
the
recommended
first-line
treatment
for
idiopathic
cases
Quinine
sulfate
also
appears
to
offer
safe
and
effective
symptom
management
of
idiopathic
cases
although
its
efficacy
has
not
been
definitively
established
in
clinical
trials
