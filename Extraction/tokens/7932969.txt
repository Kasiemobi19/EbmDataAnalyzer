Title
Comparison
of
transvaginal
sonography
with
endometrial
biopsy
in
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
compare
TVS
with
endometrial
biopsy
as
a
screening
technique
in
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
Asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
were
recruited
by
newspaper
advertisement
Each
study
patient
was
subjected
to
pelvic
examination
and
TVS
followed
by
endometrial
biopsy
Patients
with
suspected
endometrial
abnormalities
by
TVS
(normal
by
endometrial
biopsy)
were
evaluated
further
with
hysteroscopy
with
biopsy
or
D&C
or
both
Eight
patients
were
identified
as
having
abnormalities
by
TVS
only
one
of
whom
had
abnormalities
by
initial
endometrial
biopsy
Two
patients
were
identified
as
having
abnormalities
by
endometrial
biopsy
and
normal
by
TVS
Further
evaluation
of
the
seven
patients
identified
as
having
abnormalities
by
TVS
(normal
by
endometrial
biopsy)
documented
all
seven
patients
as
having
abnormalities
The
total
yield
of
abnormalities
with
TVS
was
16%
(eight
of
50
patients)
The
total
yield
of
abnormalities
with
endometrial
biopsy
was
6%
(three
of
50
patients)
The
sensitivity
of
TVS
in
identifying
endometrial
abnormalities
was
80%
(eight
of
10)
while
endometrial
biopsy
was
only
30%
(three
of
10)
TVS
was
more
sensitive
in
detecting
endometrial
abnormalities
including
endometrial
hyperplasia
than
was
endometrial
biopsy
The
use
of
endometrial
biopsy
as
a
screening
technique
in
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
patients
is
questioned
