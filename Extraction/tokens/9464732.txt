Title
Timing
of
intrapartum
ampicillin
and
prevention
of
vertical
transmission
of
group
B
streptococcus
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
relationship
between
the
time
elapsed
from
the
administration
of
ampicillin
prophylaxis
to
delivery
and
its
efficacy
in
interrupting
intrapartum
transmission
of
group
B
streptococcus
During
the
12-month
study
period
all
women
who
came
to
the
Virgen
de
las
Nieves
Hospital
(Granada
Spain)
for
delivery
were
screened
for
group
B
streptococcus
vaginal
carriage
by
a
pigment-detection
culture-based
procedure
Colonized
women
were
treated
with
ampicillin
(2
g
intravenously)
and
the
interval
between
ampicillin
administration
and
delivery
was
recorded
Newborns
from
colonized
mothers
also
were
screened
to
detect
group
B
streptococcus
colonization
During
the
study
period
4525
women
were
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
delivery
and
screened
for
group
B
streptococcus
vaginal
colonization
Group
B
streptococcus
was
detected
in
543
women
(12%)
of
whom
454
gave
birth
vaginally
to
454
liveborn
infants
Intrapartum
ampicillin
was
given
to
201
of
these
454
women
(44%)
and
10%
of
the
newborns
from
mothers
who
received
intrapartum
ampicillin
prophylaxis
were
colonized
by
group
B
streptococcus
The
relationship
between
timing
of
ampicillin
administration
and
rate
of
neonatal
group
B
streptococcal
transmission
was
as
follows
less
than
1
hour
before
delivery
46%
1-2
hours
29%
2-4
hours
29%
and
more
than
4
hours
12%
Among
the
253
mothers
who
received
no
intrapartum
prophylaxis
colonization
was
found
in
120
of
their
newborns
(47%)
When
the
time
between
the
start
of
ampicillin
prophylaxis
and
delivery
is
at
least
2
hours
vertical
transmission
of
group
B
streptococcus
is
minimized
