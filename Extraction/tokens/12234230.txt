Ultrasound-guided
extracorporeal
shock
wave
therapy
for
plantar
fasciitis
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Extracorporeal
shock
wave
therapy
(ESWT)
is
increasingly
used
for
plantar
fasciitis
but
limited
evidence
supports
its
use
To
determine
whether
ultrasound-guided
ESWT
reduces
pain
and
improves
function
in
patients
with
plantar
fasciitis
Double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
trial
conducted
between
April
1999
and
June
2001
Participants
were
recruited
from
the
community-based
referring
physicians
(primary
care
physicians
rheumatologists
orthopedic
surgeons
and
sports
physicians)
of
a
radiology
group
in
Melbourne
Australia
We
screened
178
patients
and
enrolled
166
160
completed
the
15-week
protocol
Entry
criteria
included
age
at
least
18
years
with
plantar
fasciitis
defined
as
heel
pain
maximal
over
the
plantar
aspect
of
the
foot
of
at
least
6
weeks'
duration
and
an
ultrasound-confirmed
lesion
defined
as
thickening
of
the
origin
of
the
plantar
fascia
of
at
least
4
mm
hypoechogenicity
and
alterations
in
the
normal
fibrillary
pattern
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
ultrasound-guided
ESWT
given
weekly
for
3
weeks
to
a
total
dose
of
at
least
1000
mJ/mm(2)
(n
=
81)
or
identical
placebo
to
a
total
dose
of
60
mJ/mm(2)
(n
=
85)
Overall
morning
and
activity
pain
measured
on
a
visual
analog
scale
Maryland
Foot
Score
walking
ability
Short-Form-36
Health
Survey
(SF-36)
score
and
Problem
Elicitation
Technique
score
measured
at
6
and
12
weeks
after
treatment
completion
At
6
and
12
weeks
there
were
significant
improvements
in
overall
pain
in
both
the
active
group
and
placebo
group
(mean
[SD]
improvement
181
[306]
and
198
[337]
at
6
weeks
[P
=74
for
between-group
difference]
and
263
[348]
and
257
[349]
at
12
weeks
[P
=99]
respectively)
Similar
improvements
in
both
groups
were
also
observed
for
morning
and
activity
pain
walking
ability
Maryland
Foot
Score
Problem
Elicitation
Technique
and
SF-36
There
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
in
the
degree
of
improvement
between
treatment
groups
for
any
measured
outcomes
We
found
no
evidence
to
support
a
beneficial
effect
on
pain
function
and
quality
of
life
of
ultrasound-guided
ESWT
over
placebo
in
patients
with
ultrasound-proven
plantar
fasciitis
6
and
12
weeks
following
treatment
