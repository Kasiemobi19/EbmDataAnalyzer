Title
Ultrasonography
versus
clinical
examination
in
evaluation
of
testicular
tumors
Abstract
Text
The
diagnostic
results
of
clinical
examination
and
gray-scale
ultrasonography
for
scrotal
pathology
were
compared
in
411
patients
Sensitivity
and
specificity
of
the
clinical
diagnosis
of
a
testis
tumor
improved
significantly
with
the
use
of
ultrasonography
Criteria
for
the
ultrasonographic
diagnosis
of
a
testicular
tumor
were
evaluated
We
had
no
false-negative
ultrasonographic
diagnoses
and
they
have
rarely
been
reported
in
the
literature
With
ultrasonography
the
number
of
false-positive
clinical
diagnoses
was
reduced
from
11
to
5
