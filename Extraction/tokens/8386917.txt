Double
blind
placebo
controlled
study
of
nedocromil
sodium
in
asthma
Abstract
Text
After
a
two
week
baseline
209
asthmatic
children
(mean
age
10
years
range
6-17)
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
4
mg
nedocromil
sodium
(n
=
110)
or
placebo
(n
=
99)
four
times
daily
for
12
weeks
in
addition
to
their
current
treatment
The
children
completed
daily
diary
cards
and
visited
the
clinic
at
four
week
intervals
Statistically
significant
differences
in
favour
of
nedocromil
sodium
were
seen
for
clinician
assessment
of
asthma
severity
and
diary
card
symptom
scores
pulmonary
function
and
inhaled
beta
2
bronchodilator
use
Total
symptom
score
decreased
by
50%
from
baseline
in
the
nedocromil
sodium
group
and
by
9%
in
the
placebo
group
during
the
final
four
weeks
Nedocromil
sodium
was
considered
very
or
moderately
effective
by
78%
of
children/parents
(placebo
59%)
and
73%
of
clinicians
(placebo
50%)
Nausea
headache
and
sleepiness
and
dyspnoea
led
to
withdrawal
of
one
child
from
nedocromil
sodium
and
placebo
treatments
respectively
Reports
of
sore
throat
and
headache
were
marginally
greater
with
the
nedocromil
sodium
treatment
It
is
concluded
that
nedocromil
sodium
was
both
effective
and
safe
in
the
treatment
of
asthma
in
children
