Suicidal
behaviour
in
youths
with
depression
treated
with
new-generation
antidepressants
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Concern
exists
that
antidepressants
can
cause
suicidality
in
youths
with
depression
To
determine
the
pooled
risk
of
self-harm
and
suicidal
behaviour
from
randomised
trials
of
newer
antidepressants
A
meta-analysis
was
carried
out
to
calculate
odds
ratios
for
the
combined
data
Self-harm
or
suicide-related
events
occurred
in
71
of
1487
(48%)
of
depressed
youths
treated
with
antidepressants
v
38
of
1254
(30%)
of
those
given
placebo
(fixed
effects
odds
ratio
170
95%
CI
113-254
P=001)
There
was
a
trend
for
individual
suicidal
thoughts
attempts
and
self-harm
to
occur
more
often
in
youths
taking
antidepressants
than
in
those
given
placebo
but
none
of
these
differences
was
statistically
significant
Antidepressants
may
cause
a
small
short-term
risk
of
self-harm
or
suicidal
events
in
children
and
adolescents
with
major
depressive
disorder
