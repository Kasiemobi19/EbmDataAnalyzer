The
timing
of
prophylactic
administration
of
antibiotics
and
the
risk
of
surgical-wound
infection
Abstract
Text
Randomized
controlled
trials
have
shown
that
prophylactic
antibiotics
are
effective
in
preventing
surgical-wound
infections
However
it
is
uncertain
how
the
timing
of
antibiotic
administration
affects
the
risk
of
surgical-wound
infection
in
actual
clinical
practice
We
prospectively
monitored
the
timing
of
antibiotic
prophylaxis
and
studied
the
occurrence
of
surgical-wound
infections
in
2847
patients
undergoing
elective
clean
or
"clean-contaminated"
surgical
procedures
at
a
large
community
hospital
The
administration
of
antibiotics
2
to
24
hours
before
the
surgical
incision
was
defined
as
early
that
during
the
2
hours
before
the
incision
as
preoperative
that
during
the
3
hours
after
the
incision
as
perioperative
and
that
more
than
3
but
less
than
24
hours
after
the
incision
as
postoperative
Of
the
1708
patients
who
received
the
prophylactic
antibiotics
preoperatively
10
(06
percent)
subsequently
had
surgical-wound
infections
Of
the
282
patients
who
received
the
antibiotics
perioperatively
4
(14
percent)
had
such
infections
(P
=
012
relative
risk
as
compared
with
the
preoperatively
treated
group
24
95
percent
confidence
interval
09
to
79)
Of
488
patients
who
received
the
antibiotics
postoperatively
16
(33
percent)
had
wound
infections
(P
less
than
00001
relative
risk
58
95
percent
confidence
interval
26
to
123)
Finally
of
369
patients
who
had
antibiotics
administered
early
14
(38
percent)
had
wound
infections
(P
less
than
00001
relative
risk
67
95
percent
confidence
interval
29
to
147)
Stepwise
logistic-regression
analysis
confirmed
that
the
administration
of
antibiotics
in
the
preoperative
period
was
associated
with
the
lowest
risk
of
surgical-wound
infection
We
conclude
that
in
surgical
practice
there
is
considerable
variation
in
the
timing
of
prophylactic
administration
of
antibiotics
and
that
administration
in
the
two
hours
before
surgery
reduces
the
risk
of
wound
infection
