Title
Effect
of
glucosamine
hydrochloride
in
the
treatment
of
pain
of
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
Abstract
Text
Glucosamine
products
have
been
used
extensively
for
the
management
of
pain
in
osteoarthritis
(OA)
We
investigated
the
efficacy
of
the
hydrochloride
salt
of
glucosamine
on
pain
and
disability
in
knee
OA
At
Week
-2
subjects
were
examined
randomized
and
instructed
to
take
only
prescribed
acetaminophen
for
pain
At
Week
0
patients
were
examined
prescribed
acetaminophen
and
either
placebo
or
glucosamine
hydrochloride
(glucosamine)
At
Week
4
the
prescriptions
for
acetaminophen
and
placebo
or
glucosamine
were
renewed
At
Weeks
4
and
8
patients
returned
diaries
and
unused
medications
and
were
examined
The
WOMAC
questionnaire
was
administered
at
Weeks
-2
0
and
8
After
completing
the
randomized
8
week
trial
subjects
were
offered
known
glucosamine
hydrochloride
capsules
in
an
8
week
open
label
trial
with
followup
telephone
survey
after
the
8
week
open
label
trial
The
primary
endpoint
(statistically
significant
difference
in
WOMAC
pain
score
between
Week
0
and
Week
8)
was
not
met
However
positive
trends
were
noted
for
the
glucosamine
group
in
23
of
24
WOMAC
questions
A
significant
difference
was
noted
from
Week
5
through
Week
8
in
the
knee
examination
(p
=
0026)
and
in
the
response
to
a
daily
diary
pain
question
(p
=
0018)
However
responding
to
the
question
"Are
you
better
than
at
the
start
of
the
trial"
40%
of
placebo
and
only
49%
of
glucosamine
subjects
answered
in
the
affirmative
(p
=
058)
At
the
end
of
the
randomized
trial
34%
of
placebo
and
47%
of
glucosamine
subjects
believed
that
they
had
been
given
glucosamine
After
the
end
of
the
8
week
open
label
trial
77%
of
the
subjects
were
still
taking
glucosamine
although
now
obliged
to
pay
for
commercially
available
products
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
pain
reduction
between
the
glucosamine
hydrochloride
and
placebo
groups
as
measured
by
WOMAC
However
the
secondary
endpoints
of
cumulative
pain
reduction
as
measured
by
daily
diary
and
knee
examination
were
favorable
suggesting
that
glucosamine
hydrochloride
benefits
some
patients
with
knee
OA
