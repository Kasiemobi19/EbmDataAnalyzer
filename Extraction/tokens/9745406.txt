Prevalence

polycystic
ovary
syndrome
in
unselected
black
and

women
of
the
southeastern
United
States
a
prospective
study
Abstract
Text
Estimates
of
the
prevalence
of
the
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS)
in
the
general
population
have
ranged
from
2-20%
The
vast
majority
of
these
reports
have
studied
White
populations
in
Europe
used
limited
definitions
of
the
disorder
and/or
used
bias
populations
such
as
those
seeking
medical
care
To
estimate
the
prevalence
of
this
disorder
in
the
United
States
and
address
these
limitations
we
prospectively
determined
the
prevalence
of
PCOS
in
a
reproductive-aged
population
of
369
consecutive
women
(174
White
and
195
Black
aged
18-45
yr)
examined
at
the
time
of
their
preemployment
physical
Body
measures
were
obtained
and
body
hair
was
quantified
by
a
modified
Ferriman-Gallwey
(F-G)
method
All
exams
were
initially
performed
by
2
trained
nurses
and
any
subject
with
an
F-G
score
above
3
was
reexamined
by
a
physician
the
same
for
all
patients
Of
the
369
women
277
(751%)
also
agreed
to
complete
a
questionnaire
and
have
additional
blood
drawn
Subjects
were
studied
regardless
of
current
estrogen/progestin
hormonal
use
(285%)
PCOS
was
defined
as
1)
oligoovulation
2)
clinical
hyperandrogenism
(ie
hirsutism)
and/or
hyperandrogenemia
and
3)
exclusion
of
other
related
disorders
such
as
hyperprolactinemia
thyroid
abnormalities
and
non-classic
adrenal
hyperplasia
Hirsutism
was
defined
by
a
F-G
score
of
6
or
more
and
hyperandrogenemia
was
defined
as
a
total
or
free
testosterone
androstenedione
and/or
dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate
level
above
the
95th
percentile
of
control
values
[ie
all
eumenorrheic
women
in
the
study
who
had
no
hirsutism
(F-G
<
or
=
5)
or
acne
and
were
receiving
no
hormonal
therapy
n
=
98]
Considering
all
369
women
studied
White
and
Black
women
had
similar
mean
ages
(294
+/-
71
and
311
+/-
78
yr
respectively)
although
White
women
had
a
lesser
body
mass
than
Black
women
(249
+/-
61
vs
292
+/-
81
kg/m2
respectively
P
<
0001)
Of
these
76%
46%
and
19%
demonstrated
a
F-G
score
of
6
or
more
8
or
10
respectively
and
there
was
no
significant
racial
difference
with
hirsutism
prevalences
of
80%
28%
and
16%
in
Whites
and
71%
61%
and
21%
in
Blacks
respectively
Of
the
277
women
consenting
to
a
history
and
hormonal
evaluation
40%
had
PCOS
as
defined
47%
(6
of
129)
of
Whites
and
34%
(5
of
148)
of
Blacks
In
conclusion
in
our
consecutive
population
of
unselected
women
the
prevalence
of
hirsutism
varied
from
2-8%
depending
on
the
chosen
cut-off
F-G
score
with
no
significant
difference
between
White
and
Black
women
Using
an
F-G
score
of
6
or
more
as
indicative
of
hirsutism
34%
of
Blacks
and
47%
of
Whites
had
PCOS
as
defined
These
data
suggest
that
PCOS
may
be
one
of
most
common
reproductive
endocrinological
disorders
of
women
