Title
Potassium
restoration
in
hypertensive
patients
made
hypokalemic
by
hydrochlorothiazide
Abstract
Text
Among
447
hypertensive
patients
most
with
a
history
of
diuretic-induced
hypokalemia
252
developed
diuretic-induced
hypokalemia
while
receiving
hydrochlorothiazide
50
mg/d
In
a
randomized
study
we
evaluated
the
efficacy
of
three
drug
regimens
in
restoring
potassium
levels
while
maintaining
blood
pressure
control
hydrochlorothiazide
(50
mg/d)
plus
potassium
supplement
(20
mmol/d)
hydrochlorothiazide
(50
mg/d)
plus
potassium
supplement
(40
mmol/d)
or
hydrochlorothiazide
(50
mg/d)
with
triamterene
(75
mg/d)
in
one
combination
tablet
In
all
groups
mean
serum
levels
of
potassium
rose
within
1
week
and
showed
no
further
change
thereafter
However
the
hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene
and
hydrochlorothiazide
plus
40
mmol
of
potassium
regimens
were
significantly
more
effective
in
restoring
serum
potassium
levels
than
was
the
hydrochlorothiazide
plus
20
mmol
of
potassium
regimen
A
significant
increase
in
magnesium
levels
was
observed
only
in
the
group
treated
with
the
hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene
combination
Each
regimen
provided
continued
control
of
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
