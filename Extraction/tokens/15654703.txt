Title
Screening
for
correctable
visual
acuity
deficits
in
school-age
children
and
adolescents
Abstract
Text
Although
the
benefits
of
vision
screening
seem
intuitive
the
value
of
such
programmes
in
junior
and
senior
schools
has
been
questioned
In
addition
to
this
there
exists
a
lack
of
clarity
regarding
the
optimum
age
and
frequency
at
which
to
carry
out
screening
The
objective
of
this
review
is
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
vision
screening
programmes
carried
out
in
schools
in
reducing
the
prevalence
of
undetected
correctable
visual
acuity
deficits
due
to
refractive
error
in
school-age
children
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
-
CENTRAL
(which
contains
the
Cochrane
Eyes
and
Vision
Trials
Register)
on
The
Cochrane
Library
(Issue
3
2004)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
August
2004)
and
EMBASE
(1980
to
August
2004)
No
language
or
date
restrictions
were
placed
on
these
searches
To
date
it
has
not
been
possible
to
carry
out
any
manual
searches
but
it
is
hoped
to
include
these
in
a
future
update
We
planned
to
include
randomised
controlled
trials
including
randomised
cluster
controlled
trials
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
study
abstracts
identified
by
the
electronic
searches
No
trials
were
identified
that
met
the
inclusion
criteria
As
no
trials
were
identified
no
formal
analysis
was
performed
A
narrative
synthesis
of
other
retrieved
studies
was
undertaken
in
order
to
explain
current
practice
At
present
there
are
no
robust
trials
available
that
allow
the
benefits
of
school
vision
screening
to
be
measured
The
disadvantage
of
attending
school
with
a
visual
acuity
deficit
also
needs
to
be
quantified
The
impact
of
a
screening
programme
will
depend
on
the
geographical
and
socio-economic
setting
in
which
it
is
conducted
There
is
therefore
clearly
a
need
for
well
planned
randomised
controlled
trials
in
various
settings
to
be
undertaken
so
that
the
potential
benefits
and
harms
of
vision
screening
can
be
measured
