of
low

in
general
practice
a
prospective
study
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
claim
that
90%
of
episodes
of
low
back
pain
that
present
to
general
practice
have
resolved
within
one
month
Prospective
study
of
all
adults
consulting
in
general
practice
because
of
low
back
pain
over
12
months
with
follow
up
at
1
week
3
months
and
12
months
after
consultation
Two
general
practices
in
south
Manchester
490
subjects
(203
men
287
women)
aged
18-75
years
Proportion
of
patients
who
have
ceased
to
consult
with
low
back
pain
after
3
months
proportion
of
patients
who
are
free
of
pain
and
back
related
disability
at
3
and
12
months
Annual
cumulative
consultation
rate
among
adults
in
the
practices
was
64%
Of
the
463
patients
who
consulted
with
a
new
episode
of
low
back
pain
275
(59%)
had
only
a
single
consultation
and
150
(32%)
had
repeat
consultations
confined
to
the
3
months
after
initial
consultation
However
of
those
interviewed
at
3
and
12
months
follow
up
only
39/188
(21%)
and
42/170
(25%)
respectively
had
completely
recovered
in
terms
of
pain
and
disability
The
results
are
consistent
with
the
interpretation
that
90%
of
patients
with
low
back
pain
in
primary
care
will
have
stopped
consulting
with
symptoms
within
three
months
However
most
will
still
be
experiencing
low
back
pain
and
related
disability
one
year
after
consultation
