Fulminant
hepatitis
associated

hepatitis
A
virus
superinfection
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
Abstract
Text
Hepatitis
A
virus
(HAV)
infection
rarely
causes
fulminant
hepatic
failure
in
people
with
no
underlying
liver
disease
There
are
limited
data
on
the
course
of
this
infection
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
and
chronic
hepatitis
C

We
prospectively
followed
from
June
1990
to
July
1997
595
adults
with
biochemical
and
histologic
evidence
of
chronic
hepatitis
B
(163
patients)
or
chronic
hepatitis
C
(432
patients)
who
were
seronegative
for
HAV
antibodies
All
were
tested
every
four
months
for
serum
IgM
and
IgG
antibodies
to
HAV
Twenty-seven
patients
acquired
HAV
superinfection
10
of
whom
had
chronic
hepatitis
B
and
17
of
whom
had
chronic
hepatitis
C
One
of
the
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
who
also
had
cirrhosis
had
marked
cholestasis
(peak
serum
bilirubin
level
28
mg
per
deciliter
[479
micromol
per
liter])
the
other
nine
had
uncomplicated
courses
of
hepatitis
A
Fulminant
hepatic
failure
developed
in
seven
of
the
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
all
but
one
of
whom
died
The
other
10
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
had
uncomplicated
courses
of
hepatitis
A

Although
most
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
who
acquired
HAV
infection
had
an
uncomplicated
course
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
had
a
substantial
risk
of
fulminant
hepatitis
and
death
associated
with
HAV
superinfection
Our
data
suggest
that
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
should
be
vaccinated
against
hepatitis
A
