Maximal
exercise
test
as
a
predictor
of
risk
for
mortality
from
coronary
heart
disease
in
asymptomatic
men
Abstract
Text
Exercise
testing
in
asymptomatic
persons
has
been
criticized
for
failing
to
accurately
predict
those
at
risk
for
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
Previous
studies
on
asymptomatic
subjects
however
may
not
have
been
large
enough
or
long
enough
to
provide
reliable
outcome
measures
This
study
examines
the
ability
of
a
maximal
exercise
test
to
predict
death
from
CHD
and
death
from
any
cause
in
a
population
of
asymptomatic
men
This
is
a
prospective
longitudinal
study
performed
between
1970
and
1989
with
an
average
follow-up
of
84
years
The
subjects
are
25927
healthy
men
20
to
82
years
of
age
at
baseline
(mean
429
years)
who
were
free
of
cardiovascular
disease
and
who
were
evaluated
in
a
preventive
medicine
clinic
The
main
outcome
measures
are
CHD
mortality
and
all-cause
mortality
During
follow-up
there
were
612
deaths
from
all
causes
and
158
deaths
from
CHD
The
sensitivity
of
an
abnormal
exercise
test
to
predict
coronary
death
was
61%
The
age-adjusted
relative
risk
of
an
abnormal
exercise
test
for
CHD
death
was
21
(69
to
633)
in
those
with
no
risk
factors
27
(107
to
688)
in
those
with
1
risk
factor
54
(215
to
1337)
in
those
with
2
risk
factors
and
80
(300
to
212
5)
in
those
with
>/=3
factors
A
maximal
exercise
test
performed
in
asymptomatic
men
free
of
cardiovascular
disease
does
appear
to
be
a
worthwhile
tool
in
predicting
future
risk
of
CHD
death
An
abnormal
exercise
test
is
a
more
powerful
predictor
of
risk
in
those
with
than
without
conventional
risk
factors
