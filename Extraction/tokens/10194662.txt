Heart

disease
management
a
critical
review
Abstract
Text
Despite
major
advances
in
the
pharmacotherapy
of
heart
failure
hospitalization
rates
remain
high
owing
in
large
part
to
a
multitude
of
psychosocial
behavioral
and
financial
factors
that
serve
as
barriers
to
effective
compliance
with
prescribed
treatment
To
deal
with
these
issues
many
centers
have
adopted
a
multidisciplinary
approach
to
heart
failure
disease
management
A
systematic
review
of
the
literature
was
conducted
using
the
Medline
database
supplemented
by
reference
lists
from
published
articles
From
1983
to
1998
16
studies
describing
multidisciplinary
heart
failure
disease
management
programs
were
published
in
the
English
language
literature
Of
these
10
were
nonrandomized
observational
studies
and
6
were
randomized
clinical
trials
All
studies
reported
significant
benefits
in
terms
of
reducing
hospital
utilization
and
several
studies
reported
improved
quality
of
life
functional
capacity
patient
satisfaction
and
compliance
with
diet
and
medications
In
all
studies
in
which
a
cost
analysis
was
performed
heart
failure
disease
management
programs
were
found
to
be
cost-effective
The
limitations
of
the
current
data
include
concerns
about
the
generalizability
of
published
findings
to
the
large
and
heterogenous
population
of
patients
with
heart
failure
in
the
community
the
feasibility
of
translating
specific
disease
management
programs
into
diverse
practice
environments
uncertainty
about
how
to
design
and
implement
a
maximally
cost-effective
heart
failure
disease
management
strategy
and
how
to
best
tailor
the
treatment
program
to
the
needs
of
each
individual
patient
The
impact
of
heart
failure
disease
management
programs
on
survival
is
also
unknown
Based
on
currently
available
data
heart
failure
disease
management
programs
appear
to
be
a
cost-effective
approach
to
reducing
morbidity
and
enhancing
quality
of
life
in
selected
patients
with
heart
failure
However
additional
study
is
needed
involving
larger
and
more
diverse
populations
to
define
the
optimal
approach
to
heart
failure
disease
management
