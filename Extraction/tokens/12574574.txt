Title
Withdrawal
of
statin
treatment
abrogates
stroke
protection
in
mice
Abstract
Text
Statins
(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
A
[HMG-CoA]
reductase
inhibitors)
reduce
stroke
damage
independent
of
lipid
lowering
by
upregulation
of
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
(eNOS)
Acute
withdrawal
of
statin
treatment
may
suppress
endothelial
NO
production
and
impair
vascular
function
To
test
this
hypothesis
we
treated
129/SV
mice
with
atorvastatin
(10
mg/kg)
for
14
days
and
then
withdrew
treatment
Treatment
with
atorvastatin
conferred
stroke
protection
by
40%
after
filamentous
occlusion
of
the
middle
cerebral
artery
followed
by
reperfusion
Withdrawal
of
statin
treatment
however
resulted
in
the
loss
of
stroke
protection
after
2
and
4
days
In
mouse
aortas
and
brain
vasculature
statins
upregulated
eNOS
message
23-
and
17-fold
respectively
as
measured
by
reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
Withdrawal
of
statins
resulted
in
5-
and
27-fold
downregulation
of
eNOS
in
aorta
and
brain
respectively
after
2
days
Statin
treatment
decreased
RhoA
GTPase
membrane
expression
to
48%
while
withdrawal
of
statins
resulted
in
4-fold
increase
of
RhoA
in
the
membrane
Moreover
platelet
factor
4
and
beta-thromboglobulin
in
plasma
were
significantly
downregulated
by
statin
treatment
but
withdrawal
of
statins
resulted
in
a
29-
and
31-fold
upregulation
after
2
days
respectively
Thrombus
formation
induced
by
ligature
of
the
inferior
vena
cava
was
significantly
reduced
by
statin
treatment
When
statin
treatment
was
withdrawn
however
protection
was
lost
between
2
and
4
days
Acute
termination
of
statin
treatment
results
in
a
rapid
loss
of
protection
in
mouse
models
of
cerebral
ischemia
and
thrombus
formation
independent
of
lipid
lowering
In
patients
with
acute
or
impending
stroke
withdrawal
of
statins
may
impair
outcome
