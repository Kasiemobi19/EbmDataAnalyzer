Cholesterol-lowering
therapy
in
women
and
elderly
patients
with
myocardial
infarction
or
angina
pectoris
findings
from
the
Scandinavian
Simvastatin
Survival
Study
(4S)
Abstract
Text
The
Scandinavian
Simvastatin
Survival
Study
(4S)
demonstrated
pronounced
reductions
in
mortality
and
major
coronary
events
in
a
cohort
of
patients
with
established
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
The
present
study
provides
a
detailed
post
hoc
assessment
of
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
simvastatin
therapy
in
the
following
subgroups
of
4S
patients
those
>
or
=
65
years
of
age
those
<
65
years
of
age
women
and
men
The
4S
cohort
of
4444
CHD
patients
included
827
women
and
1021
patients
>
or
=
65
years
of
age
Total
cholesterol
at
baseline
was
55
to
80
mmol/L
with
triglycerides
<
or
=
25
mmol/L
Patients
were
randomized
to
therapy
with
simvastatin
20
to
40
mg
daily
or
placebo
for
a
median
follow-up
period
of
54
years
End
points
consisted
of
all-cause
and
CHD
mortality
major
coronary
events
(primarily
CHD
death
and
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction)
other
acute
CHD
and
atherosclerotic
events
hospitalizations
for
CHD
and
cardiovascular
events
and
coronary
revascularization
procedures
Mean
changes
in
serum
lipids
were
similar
in
the
different
subgroups
In
patients
>
or
=
65
years
of
age
in
the
simvastatin
group
relative
risks
(95%
confidence
intervals)
for
clinical
events
were
as
follows
all-cause
mortality
066
(048
to
090)
CHD
mortality
057
(039
to
083)
major
coronary
events
066
(052
to
084)
any
atherosclerosis-related
event
067
(056
to
081)
and
revascularization
procedures
059
(041
to
084)
In
women
the
corresponding
figures
were
116
(068
to
199)
086
(042
to
174)
066
(048
to
091)
071
(056
to
091)
and
051
(030
to
086)
respectively
Cholesterol
lowering
with
simvastatin
produced
similar
reductions
in
relative
risk
for
major
coronary
events
in
women
compared
with
men
and
in
elderly
(>
or
=
65
years
of
age)
compared
with
younger
patients
There
were
too
few
female
deaths
to
assess
the
effects
on
mortality
in
women
Because
mortality
rates
increased
substantially
with
age
the
absolute
risk
reduction
for
both
all-cause
and
CHD
mortality
in
simvastatin-treated
subjects
was
approximately
twice
as
great
in
the
older
patients
