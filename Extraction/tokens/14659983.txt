clinicians
worldwide
share
concerns
that
many
youngsters
with

disorder
(ADHD)
and/or
disruptive
behaviour
disorders
(DBDs)
do
not
receive
appropriate
treatment
despite
availability
of
effective
therapies
At
the
request
of
Johnson
and
Johnson
(sponsor)
11
international
experts
in
child
and
adolescent
psychiatry
were
selected
by
Professor
Stan
Kutcher
(chair)
to
address
these
concerns
This

describes
the
experts'
consensus
conclusions
including
treatment
practice
suggestions
for
physicians
involved
in
the
early
treatment
of
youngsters
with
ADHD
(or
hyperkinetic
disorder
in
countries
preferring
this
classification)
and/or
DBDs
internationally
suggested
first-line
treatment
for
ADHD
without
comorbidity
is
psychostimulant
medication
aided
by
psychosocial
intervention
For
ADHD
with
comorbid
conduct
disorder
(CD)
psychosocial
intervention
combined
with
pharmacotherapy
is
suggested
For
primary
CD
suggested
first-line
treatment
is
psychosocial
intervention
with
pharmacotherapy
considered
as
an
'add-on'
when
aggression/impulsivity
is
marked
and
persistent
Pharmacotherapy
requires
careful
titration
full-day
coverage
is
the
suggested
goal
Regular
long-term
follow-up
is
recommended
