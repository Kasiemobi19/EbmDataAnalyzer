is
the
most
important
factor
for
prediction

Abstract
Text
Differentiation
between
Type
1
and
Type
2
diabetes
in
adults
is
difficult
at
diagnosis
In
this
study
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
autoantibodies
at
diagnosis
are
predictive
for
insulin
treatment
within
3
years
in
patients
initially
not
classified
as
Type
1
diabetes
In
a
nationwide
population-based
study
blood
samples
were
obtained
from
764
patients
all
diagnosed
with
diabetes
during
a
2-year
period
At
diagnosis
583
(76%)
were
classified
as
Type
1
110
(14%)
as
Type
2
and
71
(93%)
could
not
be
classified
Among
patients
not
classified
as
Type
1
diabetes
52
(47%)
of
Type
2
and
42
(59%)
of
unclassified
patients
were
positive
for
islet
cell
antibodies
(ICA)
glutamic
acid
decarboxylase
antibodies
(GADA)
or
tyrosine
phosphatase
antibodies
(IA-2A)
These
patients
(n=94)
had
lower
body
mass
index
(BMI)
(p<0001)
and
lower
C-peptide
(p<0001)
compared
to
the
autoantibody
negative
patients
(n=87)
Compared
to
clinically
classified
Type
1
diabetes
patients
positive
for
autoantibodies
(n=477)
they
have
higher
BMI
(p<0001)
higher
C-peptide
(p<0001)
and
the
same
levels
of
ICA
GADA
and
IA-2A
After
3
years
93%
of
autoantibody
positive
patients
initially
not
classified
as
Type
1
were
on
insulin
When
ICA
GADA
IA-2A
BMI
and
C-peptide
were
tested
in
a
multiple
logistic
regression
only
GADA
was
significant
for
insulin
treatment
within
3
years
(OR=188
95%
CI
18-191)
in
patients
treated
with
diet
or
oral
drugs
at
diagnosis
A
correct
classification
is
difficult
in
adult
diabetic
patients
The
presence
of
pancreatic
autoantibodies
especially
GADA
at
diagnosis
of
diabetes
are
highly
predictive
for
insulin
therapy
within
3
years
from
diagnosis
