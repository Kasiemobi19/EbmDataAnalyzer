Title
Drugs
for
treating
giardiasis
Abstract
Text
There
can
be
a
high
rate
of
recurrence
of
disease
after
initial
drug
treatment
for
giardiasis
These
drugs
also
have
a
range
of
adverse
effects
The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
drug
treatments
for
giardiasis
We
searched

Cochrane
Infectious
Diseases
Group

Randomised
and
quasi-randomised
trials
of
drug
therapy
for
giardiasis
compared
with
placebo
or
another
drug
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
trial
quality
and
extracted
data
Thirty-four
trials
were
included
Only
one
trial
was
without
serious
methodological
flaws
Compared
with
placebo
drug
treatment
was
associated
with
an
improved
cure
rate
(odds
ratio
115
95%
confidence
interval
23
to
58)
Metronidazole
treatment
longer
than
three
days
had
a
better
parasitological
cure
rate
than
other
long
treatment
courses
(odds
ratio
24
95%
confidence
interval
13
to
44)
but
there
was
significant
heterogeneity
between
the
trials
Single
dose
therapy
appeared
equally
effective
as
longer
treatment
courses
(odds
ratio
033
95%
confidence
interval
008
to
134)
Within
the
single
dose
regimens
tinidazole
had
a
comparable
parasitological
cure
rate
to
other
short
therapies
(odds
ratio
34
95%
confidence
interval
095
to
12)
but
had
a
higher
clinical
cure
rate
(odds
ratio
53
95%
27-107)
A
single
dose
of
tinidazole
appears
to
give
the
highest
clinical
cure
rate
for
giardiasis
with
relatively
few
adverse
effects
