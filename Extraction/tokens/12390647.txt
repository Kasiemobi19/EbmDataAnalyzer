Sodium
valproate
prophylaxis
in
childhood
migraine
Abstract
Text
Migraine
is
a
cause
of
recurrent
headache
in
childhood
The
efficacy
of
sodium
valproate
is
well
known
in
the
prophylactic
treatment
of
adult
migraine
but
there
are
few
studies
involving
the
drug's
effect
in
pediatric
migraine
To
determine
the
efficacy
of
sodium
valproate
in
the
prophylactic
treatment
of
childhood
migraine
Fifteen
children
with
migraine
according
to
International
Headache
Society
criteria
were
included
in
the
study
Headache
severity
was
measured
and
assessed
by
Algology
unit
by
a
using
visual
analog
scale
and
a
numerical
rating
scale
All
of
the
subjects
were
asked
to
keep
a
headache
diary
for
8
weeks
Three
subjects
who
had
no
headache
attacks
during
the
baseline
period
and
two
cases
who
were
lost
to
follow
up
were
excluded
Thus
sodium
valproate
was
initiated
in
10
subjects
(six
boys
four
girls)
500
mg/night
and
the
daily
dose
was
increased
up
to
1000
mg
according
to
blood
levels
Their
ages
ranged
from
9
to
17
(mean
age
136
+/-
32
years)
Therapy
continued
for
at
least
12
weeks
Headache
severity
as
measured
via
the
mean
visual
analog
score
was
68
+/-
18
at
baseline
and
was
07
+/-
12
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
period
(P
=
0000)
Mean
headache
attacks
per
month
were
6
+/-
42
at
baseline
and
were
08
+/-
19
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
period
(P
=
0002)
The
duration
of
headache
was
significantly
decreased
from
a
mean
of
55
+/-
39
hours
to
11
+/-
25
hours
with
treatment
(P
=
0001)
The
observed
side
effects
were
dizziness
drowsiness
and
increase
in
appetite
none
required
drug
withdrawal
In
two
cases
headache
attacks
recurred
after
the
cessation
of
valproate
and
therapy
was
restarted
Headache
control
lasted
for
six
months
following
cessation
of
the
drug
in
the
remainder
of
the
subjects
Sodium
valproate
appears
to
be
effective
and
safe
in
selected
patients
with
childhood
migraine
