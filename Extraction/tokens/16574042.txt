Mobilization
versus
immobilization
in
the
treatment
of
acute
proximal
deep
venous
thrombosis
a
prospective
randomized
open
multicentre
trial
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
prescribing
strict
bed
rest
for
acute
deep
venous
thrombosis
is
to
reduce
the
risk
of
pulmonary
embolism
and
pain
in
the
legs
as
well
as
swelling
This
study
was
performed
in
order
to
compare
outcome
of
mobilization
against
5
days
of
strict
bed
rest
in
patients
with
acute
proximal
deep
venous
thrombosis
(DVT)
103
in-patients
with
proximal
DVT
or
patients
admitted
to
the
hospital
because
of
proximal
DVT
were
recruited
to
a
randomized
study
All
patients
were
treated
in
hospital
and
given
a
lower
leg
and
thigh
compression
bandage
as
well
as
therapeutic
doses
of
the
low
molecular
weight
heparin
dalteparin-sodium
(Fragmin)
Seven
of
52
patients
(135%)
in
the
mobile
group
versus
14
of
50
patients
(280%)
in
the
immobile
group
suffered
at
least
one
of
the
outcomes
defined
under
the
combined
primary
endpoint
(clinically
relevant
pulmonary
embolisms
pulmonary
embolisms
detectable
by
scintigraphy
or
computer
tomography
progression
of
thrombosis
or
new
thrombosis
nosocomial
infections
and/or
serious
adverse
events)
(p
=
0088)
whereby
serious
adverse
events
occurred
once
in
the
mobile
group
and
three
times
in
the
immobile
group
New
pulmonary
embolisms
over
the
course
were
seen
in
10
of
50
patients
(20%)
with
a
perfusion
disorder
at
baseline
scintigraphy
while
such
was
ascertained
only
in
one
of
52
patients
(19%)
without
a
perfusion
disorder
at
baseline
scintigraphy
Leg
pain
was
reduced
from
541
(+/-304)
to
207
(+/-192)
in
the
mobilized
group
and
from
410
(+/-268)
to
140
(+/-111)
in
the
immobilized
patients
Leg
pain
was
assessed
using
the
visual
analogue
scale
(0
=
no
pain
100
=
maximum
pain)
More
immobilized
patients
complained
of
increasing
back
pain
(23%
versus
6%)
and
disturbed
micturition
(10%
versus
2%)
as
well
as
defecation
(13%
versus
6%)
on
day
5
More
patients
in
the
mobile
group
reported
increased
stress
from
the
thrombosis
and
its
treatment
(15%
versus
6%)
No
benefit
of
prescribing
bed
rest
in
patients
with
deep
venous
thrombosis
could
be
detected
in
this
study
Based
on
data
available
strict
bed
rest
for
at
least
5
days
is
not
justified
if
adequate
therapy
with
low
molecular
weight
heparin
and
adequate
compression
is
assured
It
remains
open
whether
patients
with
initial
signs
of
pulmonary
embolism
might
profit
from
a
brief
immobilization
