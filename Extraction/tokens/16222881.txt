Effectiveness
of
a

in
preventing

pneumococcal
infection

Abstract
Text
This
retrospective
cohort
study
evaluated
the
effectiveness
of
a
23-valent
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
in
reducing
hospital
admission
for
pneumonia
otitis
media
and
exacerbation
of
asthma
or
other
syndromes
due
to
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
in
9170
high-risk
individuals
Cohort
members
were
followed
from
1
January
1998
to
31
December
2002
With
regard
to
preventing
hospitalization
due
to
pneumonia
we
observed
a
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
1/10000
person-months
and
a
reduction
in
the
relative
risk
of
38%
in
the
vaccinated
cohort
compared
with
the
non-vaccinated
subjects
A
decrease
in
the
risk
of
hospital
admission
for
asthma
acute
otitis
media
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
and
other
respiratory
infections
was
also
observed
in
vaccinated
compared
with
non-vaccinated
subjects
The
specificity
of
these
findings
was
confirmed
by
the
lack
of
a
protective
effect
from
vaccination
for
those
outcomes
such
as
hospitalization
'for
all
causes'
and
'other
otorhinolaryngological
diagnoses'
that
were
not
directly
related
to
pneumococcal
disease
