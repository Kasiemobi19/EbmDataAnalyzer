Title
Anti-cholinergic
bronchodilators
versus
beta2-sympathomimetic
agents
for
acute
exacerbations
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
Abstract
Text
Inhaled
bronchodilators
form
the
mainstay
of
treatment
for
acute
exacerbations
of
COPD
Two
types
of
agent
are
used
routinely
either
singly
or
in
combination
anticholinergic
agents
and
beta2-sympathomimetic
agonists
To
assess
the
effect
of
anti-cholinergic
agents
on
lung
function
and
dyspnea
in
patients
with
acute
exacerbations
of
COPD
compared
with
placebo
or
short-acting
beta-2
agonists
A
comprehensive
search
of
the
literature
was
carried
out
on
MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
and
the
Cochrane
COPD
Trials
Register
using
the
terms
bronchodilator*
OR
ipratropium
OR
oxitropium
References
listed
in
each
included
trial
were
searched
for
additional
trial
reports
Studies
were
included
if
the
participants
were
adult
patients
with
a
known
diagnosis
of
COPD
and
had
symptoms
consistent
with
criteria
for
acute
exacerbation
of
COPD
All
randomized
controlled
trials
that
compared
inhaled
ipratropium
bromide
or
oxitropium
bromide
to
appropriate
controls
were
considered
Appropriate
control
treatments
included
placebo
other
bronchodilating
agents
or
combination
therapies
Studies
of
acute
asthma
or
ventilated
patients
were
excluded
All
trials
that
appeared
to
be
relevant
were
assessed
by
two
reviewers
who
independently
selected
trials
for
inclusion
Differences
were
resolved
by
consensus
Four
trials
compared
the
short-term
effects
of
ipratropium
bromide
vs
a
beta2-agonist
Short-term
changes
in
FEV1
(up
to
90
minutes)
showed
no
significant
difference
between
beta2-agonist
and
ipratropium
bromide
treated
patients
The
differences
were
similar
among
the
studies
and
when
combined
Weighted

There
was
no

in

adding

to
beta2-agonist

Long-term

and
beta2-agonist
treatment
combination
were
similar
WMD

(95%CI

Neither
of
two
studies
found
significant
changes
in
PaO2
either
short-
or
long-term
with
ipratropium
vs
beta-agonist
although
one
showed
an
increase
in
PaO2
in
subjects
receiving
ipratropium
bromide
at
60
minutes
Adverse
drug
reactions
included
dry
mouth
and
tremor
There
was
no
evidence
that
the
degree
of
bronchodilation
achieved
with
ipratropium
bromide
was
greater
than
that
using
a
short-acting
beta2-agonist
The
combination
of
a
beta2-agonist
and
ipratropium
did
not
appear
to
increase
the
effect
on
FEV1
more
than
either
used
alone
