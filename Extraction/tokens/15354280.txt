Title
Effect
of
tegaserod
in
chronic
constipation
a
randomized
double-blind
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Chronic
constipation
is
a
common
gastrointestinal
disorder
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
safety
and
tolerability
of
tegaserod
a
serotonin
subtype
4
receptor
partial
agonist
in
patients
with
chronic
constipation
This
was
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
After
a
2-week
baseline
patients
received
tegaserod
2
mg
twice
daily
(n
=
450)
tegaserod
6
mg
twice
daily
(n
=
451)
or
placebo
(n
=
447)
for
12
weeks
followed
by
a
4-week
withdrawal
period
Responders
were
those
patients
having
been
treated
for
at
least
7
days
with
an
increase
of
>
or
=1
complete
spontaneous
bowel
movement/week
vs
baseline
during
weeks
1-4
(primary
variable)
and
weeks
1-12
(secondary
variable)
Other
secondary
variables
included
patient
assessment
of
constipation
symptoms
(number
of
bowel
movements
stool
form
abdominal
bloating/distention
straining
and
abdominal
pain/discomfort)
and
global
assessment
of
constipation
and
bowel
habits
Responder
rates
for
complete
spontaneous
bowel
movement
during
weeks
1-4
were
significantly
greater
(
P
<
00001)
in
the
tegaserod
2
mg
twice
daily
(414%)
and
6
mg
twice
daily
groups
(432%)
vs
placebo
(251%)
This
effect
was
maintained
over
12
weeks
Statistically
significant
improvements
over
placebo
were
observed
across
the
majority
of
secondary
variables
for
both
tegaserod
doses
No
rebound
effect
was
observed
after
treatment
withdrawal
Tegaserod
was
well
tolerated
headache
and
nasopharyngitis
the
most
frequent
adverse
events
were
more
common
in
the
placebo
group
than
in
either
tegaserod
group
Over
12
weeks
tegaserod
treatment
produced
significant
improvements
in
chronic
constipation
symptoms
and
was
also
safe
and
well
tolerated
