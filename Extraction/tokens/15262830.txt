Prevalence
of
and
risk
factors
for
peripheral
arterial
disease
in
the

results

Survey

Abstract
Text
Peripheral
arterial
disease
(PAD)
is
associated
with
significant
morbidity
and
mortality
and
is
an
important
marker
of
subclinical
coronary
heart
disease
However
estimates
of
PAD
prevalence
in
the
general
US
population
have
varied
widely
We
analyzed
data
from
2174
participants
aged
40
years
and
older
from
the
1999-2000
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
PAD
was
defined
as
an
ankle-brachial
index
<090
in
either
leg
The
prevalence
of
PAD
among
adults
aged
40
years
and
over
in
the
United
States
was
43%
(95%
CI
31%
to
55%)
which
corresponds
to
approximately
5
million
individuals
(95%
CI
4
to
7
million)
Among
those
aged
70
years
or
over
the
prevalence
was
145%
(95%
CI
108%
to
182%)
In
age-
and
gender-adjusted
logistic
regression
analyses
black
race/ethnicity
(OR
283
95%
CI
148
to
542)
current
smoking
(OR
446
95%
CI
225
to
884)
diabetes
(OR
271
95%
CI
103
to
712)
hypertension
(OR
175
95%
CI
097
to
313)
hypercholesterolemia
(OR
168
95%
CI
109
to
257)
and
low
kidney
function
(OR
200
95%
CI
108
to
370)
were
positively
associated
with
prevalent
PAD
More
than
95%
of
persons
with
PAD
had
1
or
more
cardiovascular
disease
risk
factors
Elevated
fibrinogen
and
C-reactive
protein
levels
were
also
associated
with
PAD
This
study
provides
nationally
representative
prevalence
estimates
of
PAD
in
the
United
States
revealing
that
PAD
affects
more
than
5
million
adults
PAD
prevalence
increases
dramatically
with
age
and
disproportionately
affects
blacks
The
vast
majority
of
individuals
with
PAD
have
1
or
more
cardiovascular
disease
risk
factors
that
should
be
targeted
for
therapy
