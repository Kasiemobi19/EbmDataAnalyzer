Alpha-fetoprotein
and/or
liver
ultrasonography
for
liver
cancer
screening
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
Abstract
Text
Chronic
hepatitis
B
infection
may
cause
liver
cancer
(hepatocellular
carcinoma
(HCC))
Alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP)
and
liver
ultrasonography
(US)
are
used
to
screen
these
patients
for
HCC
It
is
uncertain
whether
screening
is
worthwhile
To
review
randomized
trials
on
screening
for
HCC
with
alpha-fetoprotein
and/or
liver
ultrasonography
among
people
with
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen
(HBsAg)
whether
asymptomatic
or
with
clinical
liver
disease
Relevant
reports
were
searched
from
electronic
databases
until
August
2002
(The
Cochrane
Hepato-Biliary
Group
Controlled
Trials
Register
The

supplemented
with
manual
searches
on
the
bibliographies
of
papers
found
and
communication
to
people
familiar
with
chronic
hepatitis
B

Randomized
trials
on
screening
for
liver
cancer
were
included
irrespective
of
language
Studies
were
excluded
if
the
hepatitis
B
status
was
uncertain
if
patients
were
not
adequately
followed
if
the
screening
tests
were
not
sensitive
widely-used
ones
or
if
the
test
was
used
for
diagnosis
rather
than
screening
for
HCC
We
analyzed
independently
all
the
studies
considered
for
inclusion
We
wrote
to
the
relevant
authors
for
further
information
Data
were
analyzed
with
Peto's
odds
ratio
(OR)
with
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
Two
trials
met
the
selection
criteria
One
trial
(n
=
18816)
compared
bi-annual
AFP
plus
US
screening
with
no
screening
for
five
years
No
data
on
all-cause
mortality
were
available
The
two
groups
did
not
differ
significantly
regarding
HCC
mortality
(OR
081
95%
CI
054
to
122)
Number
of
patients
with
HCC
was
significantly
increased
in
the
screeened
group
(OR
137
95%
CI
100
to
188)
Most
HCCs
in
the
screened
group
but
none
in
the
control
group
were
at
an
early
stage
The
survival
rate
of
patients
with
resected
HCC
in
the
screened
group
reached
527%
after
three
and
five
years
but
was
0%
for
those
in
the
control
group
The
authors'
estimated
lead-time
for
HCC
was
54
months
suggesting
that
screening
prolonged
the
survival
of
HCC
Another
trial
(n
=
1069)
compared
AFP
plus
US
versus
AFP
screening
but
could
not
decide
which
approach
was
superior
due
to
the
small
sample
size
(number
of
detected
HCC
OR
074
95%
CI
026
to
212)
There
are
not
enough
quality
trials
to
support
or
refute
screening
of
HBsAg-positive
patients
for
HCC
It
is
possible
that
screening
may
be
effective
but
also
that
harm
caused
by
screening/treatment
may
outweigh
any
gain
More
and
better-designed
large
randomized
trials
are
required
