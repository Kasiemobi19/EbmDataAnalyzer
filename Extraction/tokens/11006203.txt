Recurrent
miscarriage--an
aspirin
a
day
Abstract
Text
Recurrent
miscarriage
and
later
pregnancy
complications
are
in
some
cases
associated
with
placental
thrombosis
and
infarction
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
value
of
low
dose
aspirin
(75
mg
daily)
in
improving
the
subsequent
livebirth
rate
amongst
women
with
either
unexplained
recurrent
early
miscarriage
(<13
weeks
gestation
n
=
805)
or
unexplained
late
pregnancy
loss
(n
=
250)
Amongst
women
with
recurrent
early
miscarriages
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
livebirth
rate
between
those
who
took
aspirin
(251/367
684%)
compared
with
those
who
did
not
take
aspirin
[278/438
635%
odds
ratio
(OR)
124
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
093-167]
This
relationship
was
independent
of
the
number
of
previous
early
miscarriages
In
contrast
women
with
a
previous
late
miscarriage
who
took
aspirin
had
a
significantly
higher
livebirth
rate
(122/189
646%)
compared
with
those
who
did
not
take
aspirin
(30/61
492%
OR
188
95%
CI
104-337)
The
empirical
use
of
low
dose
aspirin
amongst
women
with
unexplained
recurrent
early
miscarriage
is
not
justified
We
are
currently
investigating
the
role
of
incremental
doses
of
aspirin
in
the
treatment
of
women
both
with
early
miscarriages
associated
with
thrombophilic
abnormalities
and
in
those
with
late
pregnancy
losses
