Dietary
fat
and
breast
cancer
risk
revisited
a
meta-analysis
of
the
published
literature
Abstract
Text
Animal
experiments
and
human
ecological
studies
suggest
that
dietary
fat
intake
is
associated
with
a
risk
of
breast
cancer
but
individual-based
studies
have
given
contradictory
results
We
have
carried
out
a
meta-analysis
of
this
association
to
include
all
papers
published
up
to
July
2003
Case-control
and
cohort
studies
that
examined
the
association
of
dietary
fat
or
fat-containing
foods
with
risk
of
breast
cancer
were
identified
A
total
of
45
risk
estimates
for
total
fat
intake
were
obtained
Descriptive
data
from
each
study
were
extracted
with
an
estimate
of
relative
risk
and
its
associated
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
and
were
analysed
using
the
random
effects
model
of
DerSimonian
and
Laird
The
summary
relative
risk
comparing
the
highest
and
lowest
levels
of
intake
of
total
fat
was
113
(95%
CI
103-125)
Cohort
studies
(N=14)
had
a
summary
relative
risk
of
111
(95%
CI
099-125)
and
case-control
studies
(N=31)
had
a
relative
risk
of
114
(95%
CI
099-132)
Significant
summary
relative
risks
were
also
found
for
saturated
fat
(RR
119
95%
CI
106-135)
and
meat
intake
(RR
117
95%
CI
106-129)
Combined
estimates
of
risk
for
total
and
saturated
fat
intake
and
for
meat
intake
all
indicate
an
association
between
higher
intakes
and
an
increased
risk
of
breast
cancer
Case-control
and
cohort
studies
gave
similar
results
