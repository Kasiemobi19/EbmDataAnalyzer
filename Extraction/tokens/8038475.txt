Title
Treatment
of
bacterial
vaginosis
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
article
is
to
review
the
treatment
options
for
bacterial
vaginosis
including
the
newer
topical
antibiotics
metronidazole
gel
and
clindamycin
cream
The
article
also
examines
the
controversies
over
whether
bacterial
vaginosis
is
a
sexually
transmitted
disease
and
whether
asymptomatic
women
should
be
treated
A
MEDLINE
search
was
conducted
to
identify
pertinent
literature
including
review
articles
Emphasis
was
placed
on
those
clinical
trials
using
metronidazole
gel
or
clindamycin
cream
Studies
addressing
the
complications
of
bacterial
vaginosis
in
pregnancy
the
risk
of
treatment
in
pregnancy
and
the
method
of
transmission
of
the
disease
also
were
reviewed
Clinical
studies
evaluating
clindamycin
cream
and
metronidazole
gel
were
scarce
therefore
data
from
all
available
trials
were
reviewed
The
objectives
methodology
and
results
from
other
studies
were
reviewed
those
addressing
complications
of
the
disease
and
risks
and
benefits
of
treatment
were
included
There
is
evidence
both
for
and
against
bacterial
vaginosis
being
a
sexually
transmitted
disease
Potential
complications
of
the
disease
may
warrant
treatment
of
certain
asymptomatic
women
especially
during
pregnancy
Treatment
options
include
oral
or
vaginal
metronidazole
or
clindamycin
all
of
which
provide
high
cure
rates
Vaginal
antibiotics
result
in
minimal
risk
to
the
fetus
in
pregnant
patients
Complications
of
bacterial
vaginosis
may
be
associated
with
significant
morbidity
especially
among
pregnant
women
Treatment
of
asymptomatic
women
with
the
disease
is
controversial
but
may
be
justified
in
certain
high-risk
populations
The
topical
agents
clindamycin
vaginal
cream
2%
and
metronidazole
vaginal
gel
075%
provide
a
safe
effective
but
expensive
alternative
to
oral
antibiotic
regimens
for
the
treatment
of
bacterial
vaginosis
