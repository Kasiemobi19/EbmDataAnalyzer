Title
Hypokalaemia
and
diuretics
an
analysis
of
publications
Abstract
Text
Published
data
have
been
used
to
define
the
characteristics
of
the
fall
in
serum
potassium
concentration
after
taking
diuretics
and
the
efficacy
of
the
various
treatments
given
to
prevent
or
correct
it
The
average
fall
is
less
after
the
usual
doses
of
frusemide
(about
03
mmol/l)
than
after
the
usual
doses
of
thiazides
(about
06
mmol/l)
and
is
little
influenced
by
the
dose
or
duration
of
treatment
The
fall
with
a
given
drug
is
the
same
in
heart
failure
and
hypertension
but
the
initial
serum
potassium
concentration
is
higher
in
heart
failure
so
that
the
final
value
is
lower
in
hypertension
In
standard
doses
potassium
supplements
are
less
effective
than
potassium-retaining
diuretics
in
correcting
the
hypokalaemia
The
relation
between
the
average
serum
potassium
value
and
the
frequency
of
low
values
(hypokalaemia)
is
such
that
very
low
values
after
taking
diuretics
are
unusual
in
patients
with
hypertension
or
heart
failure
Hypokalaemia
would
almost
disappear
as
an
important
complication
of
diuretic
treatment
if
it
was
defined
as
a
value
less
than
30
mmol/l
rather
than
as
a
value
less
than
35
mmol/l
