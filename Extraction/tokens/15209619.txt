Cisapride
treatment
of
constipation-predominant
irritable
bowel
syndrome
is
not
superior
to
placebo
Abstract
Text
Previous
studies
with
cisapride
reported
conflicting
results
in
patients
with
constipation-predominant
irritable
bowel
syndrome
(IBS)
To
gain
further
evidence
this
randomized
double-blind
study
was
carried
out
Eighty-two
symptomatic
outpatients
were
randomized
to
receive
either
5
mg
oral
cisapride
or
placebo
three
times
daily
for
a
period
of
12
weeks
In
patients
without
satisfactory
improvement
after
4
weeks
the
dose
was
doubled
Symptom
evaluation
used
visual
analog
scales
(VAS)
and
the
investigators'
global
assessment
After
4
weeks
in
18
(45%)
cisapride
and
24
(57%)
placebo
patients
the
dose
was
doubled
because
of
insufficient
improvement
of
symptoms
The
mean
VAS
score
for
patients'
global
rating
of
IBS
symptoms
at
baseline
was
675
mm
for
cisapride
versus
707
mm
for
placebo
and
improved
to
384
mm
versus
445
mm
after
12
weeks
of
treatment
Investigators
rated
the
overall
effect
of
therapy
as
good
or
excellent
in
70%
of
the
cisapride
and
50%
of
the
placebo
group
Neither
these
nor
further
efficacy
parameter
differences
reached
statistical
significance
These
results
indicate
that
the
effect
of
15-30
mg
cisapride
daily
on
symptoms
of
constipation-predominant
IBS
is
not
significantly
superior
to
placebo
During
the
12
week
treatment
of
this
trial
cisapride
proved
to
be
safe
and
tolerable
