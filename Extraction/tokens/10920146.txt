The
influence

intrapartum
antibiotics
on
the
clinical
spectrum
of
early-onset

in
term
infants
Abstract
Text
The
use
of
intrapartum
antibiotics
to
prevent
early-onset
group
B
streptococcal
(EOGBS)
infection
has
left
pediatricians
in
a
quandary
about
the
appropriate
evaluation
and
treatment
of
infants
at
risk
for
this
infection
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
intrapartum
antibiotic
prophylaxis
changed
the
constellation
and
timing
of
onset
of
clinical
signs
of
group
B
streptococcal
(GBS)
infection
in
term
infants
We
conducted
a
retrospective
chart
review
of
infants
who
had
EOGBS
infection
and
were
born
in
Southern
California
Kaiser
Permanente
Hospitals
from
1988
through
1996
Objective
criteria
were
used
to
ascertain
maternal
risk
of
infection
intrapartum
antibiotic
prophylaxis
and
onset
of
clinical
signs
of
infection
Three
hundred
nineteen
infants
with
EOGBS
sepsis
bacteremia
or
clinically
suspected
infection
were
identified
from
a
population
of
277
912
live
births
Of
the
172
term
infants
with
culture-positive
infection
who
had
clinical
signs
of
infection
95%
exhibited
them
in
the
first
24
hours
of
life
All
of
the
infants
exposed
to
intrapartum
antibiotics
became
ill
within
the
first
24
hours
of
life
Exposure
to
antibiotics
during
labor
did
not
change
the
clinical
spectrum
of
disease
or
the
onset
of
clinical
signs
of
infection
within
24
hours
of
birth
for
term
infants
with
EOGBS
infection
A
48-hour
stay
is
not
required
to
monitor
asymptomatic
term
infants
exposed
to
intrapartum
antibiotics
for
onset
of
GBS
infection
