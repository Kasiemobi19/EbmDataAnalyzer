Preventing
escalation
in
problem
behaviors
with
high-risk
young
adolescents
immediate
and
1-year
outcomes
Abstract
Text
The
study
tested
alternative
intervention
strategies
to
reduce
escalation
in
problem
behaviors
among
high-risk
young
adolescents
(11
to
14
years
old)
A
total
of
158
families
with
young
adolescents
(male
and
female)
participated
in
this
study
Of
these
119
families
were
randomly
assigned
to
1
of
the
following
intervention
conditions
(a)
parent
focus
(b)
teen
focus
(c)
parent
and
teen
focus
(d)
self-directed
change
(materials
only)
In
addition
39
families
of
young
adolescents
were
recruited
as
a
quasi-experimental
control
Parent
focus
and
teen
focus
interventions
resulted
in
immediate
beneficial
effects
in
observed
and
reported
family
conflict
The
parent
intervention
conditions
showed
immediate
beneficial
effects
on
behavior
problems
at
school
Longitudinal
trends
suggest
that
the
parent
focus
condition
may
reduce
subsequent
tobacco
use
compared
with
all
other
approaches
Interventions
that
aggregated
high-risk
youths
into
groups
however
showed
the
highest
escalations
in
tobacco
use
and
problem
behavior
at
school
beginning
at
termination
and
persisting
to
follow-up
These
findings
are
discussed
with
respect
to
the
need
to
re-evaluate
strategies
that
aggregate
high-risk
youths
into
intervention
programs
and
focus
more
on
strategies
to
engage
parents
in
prevention
