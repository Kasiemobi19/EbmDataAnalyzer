megestrol

suspension
for
elderly
patients
with
reduced
appetite
after

II
randomized
clinical
trial
Abstract
Text
To
provide
preliminary
evidence
on
the
effectiveness
and
optimal
dosage
of
megestrol
acetate
for
older
persons
with
impaired
appetite
after
hospitalization
Randomized
clinical
trial
Acute
care
hospital
Forty-seven
older
persons
(mean
age
83)
who
were
recently
discharged
from
an
acute
care
hospital
and
had
fair
or
poor
appetite
Participants
were
randomized
to
placebo
or
megestrol
acetate
suspension
200
mg
400
mg
or
800
mg
daily
for
9
weeks
Appetite
health-related
quality
of
life
and
adverse
effects
were
measured
at
baseline
and
20
42
and
63
days
Serum
nutritional
markers
were
measured
at
baseline
and
20
and
63
days
During
the
course
of
the
study
there
were
no
significant
differences
between
treatment
groups
on
any
of
the
appetite
questions
although
participants
in
the
400-mg
and
800-mg
groups
demonstrated
significant
improvement
from
baseline
on
some
questions
At
20
days
prealbumin
increased
in
a
dose-response
relationship
across
the
four
groups
(by
04
51
75
and
90
mg/dL
respectively)
Participants
in
the
400-mg
and
800-mg
groups
demonstrated
greater
improvement
in
prealbumin
levels
at
20
days
than
those
receiving
placebo
(P=009
and
P=004
respectively)
and
those
in
the
400-mg
group
also
demonstrated
improvement
at
63
days
(P=02)
At
20
days
no
participant
taking
placebo
had
a
morning
serum
cortisol
level
less
than
8
ng/mL
(the
lower
limit
of
normal)
In
contrast
33%
70%
and
78%
of
those
taking
200
mg
400
mg
and
800
mg
respectively
had
values
below
this
level
by
63
days
these
percentages
were
11%
30%
56%
and
37%
respectively
No
patient
reported
clinical
symptoms
of
adrenal
insufficiency
Diarrhea
developed
in
three
subjects
and
thromboembolism
occurred
in
two
receiving
active
treatment
Megestrol
acetate
at
doses
of
400
mg
and
800
mg
increases
prealbumin
in
recently
hospitalized
older
persons
Cortisol
suppression
is
common
at
higher
doses
and
may
be
persistent
In
this
small
study
the
drug
did
not
confer
benefit
on
other
nutritional
or
clinical
outcomes
