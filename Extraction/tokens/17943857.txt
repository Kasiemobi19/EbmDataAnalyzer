Title
Antidepressants
for
neuropathic
pain
Abstract
Text
This
is
an
updated
version
of
the
original
Cochrane
review
published
in
Issue
3
2005
of
The
Cochrane
Library
For
many
years
antidepressant
drugs
have
been
used
to
manage
neuropathic
pain
and
are
often
the
first
choice
treatment
It
is
not
clear
however
which
antidepressant
is
more
effective
what
role
the
newer
antidepressants
can
play
in
treating
neuropathic
pain
and
what
adverse
effects
are
experienced
by
patients
To
determine
the
analgesic
effectiveness
and
safety
of
antidepressant
drugs
in
neuropathic
pain
Randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
of
antidepressants
in
neuropathic
pain
were
identified
in
MEDLINE
(1966
to
Oct
2005)
EMBASE
(1980
to
Oct
2005)
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
in
The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
3
2005
and
the
Cochrane
Pain
Palliative
and
Supportive
Care
Trials
Register
(May
2002)
Additional
reports
were
identified
from
the
reference
list
of
the
retrieved
papers
and
by
contacting
investigators
RCTs
reporting
the
analgesic
effects
of
antidepressant
drugs
in
adult
patients
with
subjective
assessment
of
pain
of
neuropathic
origin
Studies
that
included
patients
with
chronic
headache
and
migraine
were
excluded
Two
review
authors
agreed
the
included
studies
extracted
data
and
assessed
methodological
quality
independently
Sixty
one
trials
of
20
antidepressants
were
considered
eligible
(3293
participants)
for
inclusion
Relative
Risk
(RR)
and
Number-Needed-to-Treat
(NNTs)
were
calculated
from
dichotomous
data
for
effectiveness
and
adverse
effects
This
update
includes
11
additional
studies
(778
participants)
Sixty
one
RCTs
were
included
in
total
Tricyclic
antidepressants
(TCAs)
are
effective
and
have
an
NNT
of
36
(95%
CI
3
to
45)
RR
21
(95%
CI
18
to
25)
for
the
achievement
of
at
least
moderate
pain
relief
There
is
limited
evidence
for
the
effectiveness
of
the
newer
SSRIs
but
no
studies
of
SNRIs
were
found
Venlafaxine
(three
studies)
has
an
NNT
of
31
(95%
CI
22
to
51)
RR
22
(95%
CI
15
to
31)
There
were
insufficient
data
to
assess
effectiveness
for
other
antidepressants
such
as
St
Johns
Wort
and
L-tryptophan
For
diabetic
neuropathy
the
NNT
for
effectiveness
was
13
(95%
CI
12
to
15)
RR
124
(95%
CI
52
to
292)
(five
studies)
for
postherpetic
neuralgia
27
(95%
CI
2
to
41)
RR
22
(95%
CI
16
to
31)
(four
studies)
There
was
evidence
that
TCAs
are
not
effective
in
HIV-related
neuropathies
The
number
needed
to
harm
(NNH)
for
major
adverse
effects
defined
as
an
event
leading
to
withdrawal
from
a
study
was
28
(95%
CI
176
to
689)
for
amitriptyline
and
162
(95%
CI
8
to
436)
for
venlafaxine
The
NNH
for
minor
adverse
effects
was
6
(95%
CI
42
to
107)
for
amitriptyline
and
96
(95%
CI
35
to
13)
for
venlafaxine
This
update
has
provided
additional
confirmation
on
the
effectiveness
of
antidepressants
for
neuropathic
pain
and
has
provided
new
information
on
another
antidepressant
-
venlafaxine
There
is
still
limited
evidence
for
the
role
of
SSRIs
Whether
antidepressants
prevent
the
development
of
neuropathic
pain
(pre-emptive
use)
is
still
unclear
Both
TCAs
and
venlafaxine
have
NNTs
of
approximately
three
This
means
that
for
approximately
every
three
patients
with
neuropathic
pain
who
are
treated
with
either
of
these
antidepressants
one
will
get
at
least
moderate
pain
relief
There
is
evidence
to
suggest
that
other
antidepressants
may
be
effective
but
numbers
of
participants
are
insufficient
to
calculate
robust
NNTs
SSRIs
are
generally
better
tolerated
by
patients
and
more
high
quality
studies
are
required
