Comparison
of
three
management
strategies
for
patients
with
atypical
squamous
cells
of
undetermined
significance
baseline
results
from
a
randomized
trial
Abstract
Text
More
than
2
million
US
women
receive
an
equivocal
cervical
cytologic
diagnosis
(atypical
squamous
cells
of
undetermined
significance
[ASCUS])
each
year
Effective
colposcopy
triage
strategies
are
needed
to
identify
the
minority
of
women
who
have
clinically
significant
disease
while
avoiding
excessive
follow-up
evaluation
for
others
The
ASCUS/LSIL
(ie
low-grade
squamous
intraepithelial
lesion)
Triage
Study
(ALTS)
is
a
multicenter
randomized
trial
comparing
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
the
following
three
management
strategies
to
detect
cervical
intraepithelial
neoplasia
grade
3
(CIN3)
1)
immediate
colposcopy
(considered
to
be
the
reference
standard)
2)
triage
to
colposcopy
based
on
human
papillomavirus
(HPV)
results
from
Hybrid
Capture
2(TM)
(HC
2)
and
thin-layer
cytology
results
or
3)
triage
based
on
cytology
results
alone
This
article
summarizes
the
cross-sectional
enrollment
results
for
3488
women
with
a
referral
diagnosis
of
ASCUS
All
statistical
tests
are
two-sided
Among
participants
with
ASCUS
the
underlying
prevalence
of
histologically
confirmed
CIN3
was
51%
Sensitivity
to
detect
CIN3
or
above
by
testing
for
cancer-associated
HPV
DNA
was
963%
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
=
916%
to
988%)
with
561%
of
women
referred
to
colposcopy
Sensitivity
of
a
single
repeat
cytology
specimen
with
a
triage
threshold
of
HSIL
or
above
was
441%
(95%
CI
=
356%
to
529%)
with
69%
referred
Sensitivity
of
a
lower
cytology
triage
threshold
of
ASCUS
or
above
was
853%
(95%
CI
=
782%
to
908%)
with
586%
referred
HC
2
testing
for
cancer-associated
HPV
DNA
is
a
viable
option
in
the
management
of
women
with
ASCUS
It
has
greater
sensitivity
to
detect
CIN3
or
above
and
specificity
comparable
to
a
single
additional
cytologic
test
indicating
ASCUS
or
above
