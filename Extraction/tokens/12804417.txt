Title
Initial
management
strategies
for
dyspepsia
Abstract
Text
This
review
considers
management
strategies
(combinations
of
initial
investigation
and
empirical
treatments)
for
dyspeptic
patients
Dyspepsia
was
defined
to
include
both
epigastric
pain
and
heartburn
To
determine
the
effectiveness
acceptability
and
cost
effectiveness
of
the
following
initial
management
strategies
for
patients
presenting
with
dyspepsia
(a)
initial
pharmacological
therapy
(including
endoscopy
for
treatment
failures)
(b)
early
endoscopy
(c)
testing
for
Helicobacter
pylori
and
endoscope
only
those
positive
(d)
Hpylori
eradication
therapy
with
or
without
prior
testing
Trials
were
located
through
electronic
searches
and
extensive
contact
with
trialists
All
randomised
controlled
trials
of
dyspeptic
patients
presenting
in
primary
care
Data
was
collected
on
dyspeptic
symptoms
quality
of
life
and
use
of
resources
Twenty
papers
reporting
23
comparisons
were
found
Trials
comparing
proton
pump
inhibitors
(PPI)
with
antacids
(two
trials)
and
H2
receptor
antagonists
(three
trials)
early
endoscopy
with
initial
acid
suppression
(five
trials)
Hpylori
'test
and
scope'
v
usual
management
(three
trials)
Hpylori
test
and
treat
v
endoscopy
(four
trials)
and
test
and
treat
v
acid
suppression
alone
in
Hpylori
positive
patients
(two
trials)
were
pooled
PPIs
were
significantly
more
effective
than
both
H2RAs
and
antacids
Relative
risks
(RR)
and
95%
CI
were
for
PPI
antacid
072
(064-080)
PPI
H2RA
063
(047-085)
Results
for
other
drug
comparisons
were
either
absent
or
inconclusive
Initial
endoscopy
was
associated
with
a
small
reduction
in
the
risk
of
recurrent
dyspeptic
symptoms
compared
with
initial
prescribing
(RR
089
(077-102)
Hpylori
test
and
endoscopy
increases
costs
in
primary
care
but
does
not
improve
symptoms
Hpylori
test
and
eradicate
may
be
as
effective
as
endoscopy-
based
management
and
reduces
costs
by
decreasing
the
proportion
of
patients
that
are
endoscoped
'Test
and
treat'
may
be
more
effective
than
acid
suppression
alone
RR
059
(042-083)
PPIs
are
effective
in
the
treatment
of
dyspepsia
in
these
trials
which
may
not
adequately
exclude
patients
with
gastro-oesophageal
reflux
disease
The
relative
efficacy
of
H2RA
and
PPI
is
uncertain
Early
investigation
by
endoscopy
or
Hpylori
testing
may
benefit
some
patients
with
dyspepsia
The
review
will
be
updated
in
2004
with
an
individual
patient
data
meta-analysis
of
the
economic
data
and
a
subgroup
analysis
by
age
and
predominant
dyspeptic
symptom
