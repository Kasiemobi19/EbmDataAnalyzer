Comparison
of
placebo
with
L-thyroxine
alone
or
with
carbimazole
for
treatment
of
sporadic
non-toxic
goitre
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
of
treatment
with
TSH-suppressive
doses
of
L-thyroxine
(T4
25
micrograms/kg
body
weight
daily)
either
alone
or
combined
with
carbimazole
(CBZ
40
mg
daily)
was
studied
in
78
patients
with
sporadic
non-toxic
goitre
in
a
prospective
placebo-controlled
double-blind
randomised
clinical
trial
Treatment
was
given
for
9
months
with
9
months
of
follow-up
A
response
to
treatment
as
measured
by
ultrasonography
was
found
in
58%
of
the
T4
group
in
35%
of
the
T4/CBZ
group
and
in
5%
of
the
placebo
group
The
mean
(SEM)
decrease
of
thyroid
volume
at
9
months
in
the
responders
was
25%
(2)
After
discontinuation
of
treatment
thyroid
volume
increased
in
the
responders
and
had
returned
to
base-line
values
after
9
months
of
follow-up
In
the
placebo
group
mean
thyroid
volume
had
increased
by
6%
(4)
at
4
months
20%
(7)
at
9
months
and
27%
(8)
at
18
months
The
findings
show
that
untreated
sporadic
non-toxic
goitre
continues
to
increase
in
size
T4
is
effective
in
the
treatment
of
the
disorder
and
the
addition
of
CBZ
has
no
therapeutic
advantage
