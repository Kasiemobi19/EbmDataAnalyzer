Title
Inguinal
hernia
challenging
the
traditional
indication
for
surgery
in
asymptomatic
patients
Abstract
Text
It
is
generally
accepted
that
most
inguinal
hernias
should
be
operated
on
electively
in
order
to
avoid
the
high
morbidity
and
mortality
associated
with
incarceration
and
small
bowel
obstruction
The
present
study
reassesses
the
indication
for
surgery
in
asymptomatic
inguinal
hernia
patients
We
analyzed
profiles
separately
for
elective
and
emergency
inguinal
herniorrhaphies
and
compared
the
morbidity
and
mortality
rates
Two
hundred
randomly
selected
elective
hernia
repairs
were
compared
with
67
incarcerated
cases
Postoperative
complications
were
more
common
following
emergency
(239%)
than
elective
repair
(105%)
however
in
both
groups
minor
complications
predominated
The
mortality
rate
in
the
incarcerated
group
(6%)
was
clearly
linked
with
a
high
preoperative
American
Society
of
Anesthesiologists
(ASA)
score
A
bowel
resection
rate
of
45%
was
found
in
the
incarcerated
cases
which
was
not
correlated
with
mortality
Patients
with
asymptomatic
inguinal
hernia
and
unfavorable
medical
conditions
should
be
recommended
an
elective
repair
preferably
under
local
anesthesia
to
avoid
the
high
mortality
associated
with
an
emergency
operation
