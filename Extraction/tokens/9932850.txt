Diet
and
chronic
constipation
in
children
the
role
of
fiber
Abstract
Text
Chronic
constipation
is
one
of
the
most
common
disorders
in
Western
countries
and
despite
numerous
clinical
pathophysiologic
and
epidemiologic
studies
its
cause
is
still
unclear
Several
hypotheses
have
been
proposed
and
according
to
experimental
studies
and
clinical
observation
fiber
intake
could
play
a
role
in
its
pathogenesis
The
purpose
of
this
case-control
study
was
to
examine
the
possible
correlation
of
idiopathic
chronic
constipation
in
children
and
dietary
intake
particularly
fiber
intake
A
randomized
sample
of
children
(291
children
with
constipation
and
1602
controls)
aged
2
to
14
years
was
taken
from
three
of
the
52
counties
of
Greece
Stratification
was
performed
on
the
basis
of
urban
rural
or
suburban
location
and
socioeconomic
status
The
nutritional
data
were
obtained
from
a
3-day
dietary
record
and
a
dietary
history
Statistical
analysis
was
performed
with
multivariate
tests
multivariate
analysis
of
variance
discriminant
analysis
and
chi-square
analysis
according
to
the
characteristics
of
the
correlated
variables
Constipated
children
had
a
lower
caloric
and
nutrient
intake
(p
<
0001)
lower
body
weight/height
(p
<
0001)
and
higher
prevalence
of
reported
anorexia
(p
<
0001)
Discriminant
analysis
indicated
that
dietary
fiber
alone
was
independently
negatively
correlated
with
chronic
constipation
despite
the
age
and
the
age
of
onset
of
constipation
Relative
risk
also
had
a
negative
correlation
with
fiber
intake
(p
<
0001)
Of
the
main
fiber
fractions
only
cellulose
and
pentose
were
independently
correlated
with
chronic
constipation
Lack
of
fiber
may
play
an
important
role
in
the
etiology
of
chronic
idiopathic
constipation
in
children
