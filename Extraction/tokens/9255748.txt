Abstract
Text
To
compare
transvaginal
ultrasonography
with
histological
findings
in
endometrial
evaluation
of
postmenopausal
women
using
hormone
replacement
therapy
and
to
evaluate
endometrial
safety
of
three
hormone
replacement
therapy
regimens
In
a
randomized
comparative
study
in
postmenopausal
women
endometrial
safety
was
evaluated
using
(1)
no
hormone
replacement
therapy
(2)
oral
micronized
17
beta-estradiol/oral
sequential
dydrogesterone
(3)
transdermal
17
beta-estradiol/oral
sequential
dydrogesterone
or
(4)
oral
tibolone
85
Non-hysterectomised
subjects
underwent
transvaginal
ultrasonography
immediately
before
Pipelle
biopsy
at
baseline
and
subsequently
after
12
and
24
months
Endometrial
thickness
and
uterine
dimensions
were
determined
by
transvaginal
ultrasonography
and
endometrial
thickness
(double-layer)
was
compared
with
biopsy
results
Endometrial
evaluation
was
conveniently
performed
by
transvaginal
ultrasonography
and
endometrial
thickness
correlated
well
with
biopsy
findings
If
endometrial
thickness
was
<
5
mm
the
endometrial
biopsy
sample
was
either
inactive/atrophic
or
insufficient
for
histopathological
diagnosis
Hyperplastic
or
malignant
changes
were
not
reported
After
24
months
endometrial
thickness
was
increased
both
in
the
oral
(P
<
0001)
and
transdermal
(P
<
0001)
17
beta-estradiol/dydrogesterone
groups
whereas
with
tibolone
the
change
in
endometrial
thickness
was
not
different
from
controls
transvaginal
ultrasonography
of
the
endometrium
reliably
predicts
the
histological
picture
in
hormone
replacement
therapy
users
Using
5
mm
endometrial
thickness
as
cut-off
point
more
than
75%
of
biopsies
could
be
avoided
All
three
hormone
replacement
therapies
were
safe
with
respect
to
the
endometrium
With
sequential
17
beta-estradiol/dydrogesterone
the
expected
progestogen-induced
secretory
pattern
was
observed
whereas
endometrial
histology
under
tibolone
closely
mimicked
the
natural
atrophic
postmenopausal
state
