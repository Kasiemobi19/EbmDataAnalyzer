Abstract
Text
In
patients
with
high
cholesterol
levels
lowering
the
cholesterol
level
reduces
the
risk
of
coronary
events
but
the
effect
of
lowering
cholesterol
levels
in
the
majority
of
patients
with
coronary
disease
who
have
average
levels
is
less
clear
In
a
double-blind
trial
lasting
five
years
we
administered
either
40
mg
of
pravastatin
per
day
or
placebo
to
4159
patients
(3583
men
and
576
women)
with
myocardial
infarction
who
had
plasma
total
cholesterol
levels
below
240
mg
per
deciliter
(mean
209)
and
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
levels
of
115
to
174
mg
per
deciliter
(mean
139)
The
primary
end
point
was
a
fatal
coronary
event
or
a
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
The
frequency
of
the
primary
end
point
was
102
percent
in
the
pravastatin
group
and
132
percent
in
the
placebo
group
an
absolute
difference
of
3
percentage
points
and
a
24
percent
reduction
in
risk
(95
percent
confidence
interval
9
to
36
percent
P
=
0003)
Coronary
bypass
surgery
was
needed
in
75
percent
of
the
patients
in
the
pravastatin
group
and
10
percent
of
those
in
the
placebo
group
a
26
percent
reduction
(P=0005)
and
coronary
angioplasty
was
needed
in
83
percent
of
the
pravastatin
group
and
105
percent
of
the
placebo
group
a
23
percent
reduction
(P=001)
The
frequency
of
stroke
was
reduced
by
31
percent
(P=003)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
overall
mortality
or
mortality
from
noncardiovascular
causes
Pravastatin
lowered
the
rate
of
coronary
events
more
among
women
than
among
men
The
reduction
in
coronary
events
was
also
greater
in
patients
with
higher
pretreatment
levels
of
LDL
cholesterol
These
results
demonstrate
that
the
benefit
of
cholesterol-lowering
therapy
extends
to
the
majority
of
patients
with
coronary
disease
who
have
average
cholesterol
levels
