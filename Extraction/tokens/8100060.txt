Prevalence
and
natural
history
of
cryptorchidism
Abstract
Text
A
prospective
hospital-based
cohort
study
was
conducted
to
determine
the
prevalence
rates
of
cryptorchidism
at
birth
3
months
and
1
year
of
age
A
total
of
6935
consecutive
male
neonates
delivered
at
Mount
Sinai
Hospital
in
New
York
City
between
October
1987
and
October
1990
were
examined
at
birth
for
cryptorchidism
Standardized
examination
and
classification
criteria
were
used
Infants
classified
as
cryptorchid
at
birth
were
reexamined
at
3
months
and
1
year
after
the
expected
date
of
delivery
Of
6935
neonates
assessed
at
birth
255
(37%)
were
found
to
be
cryptorchid
at
birth
The
rates
were
significantly
elevated
for
low
birth
weight
preterm
small-for-gestational
age
and
twin
neonates
The
overall
rate
had
declined
to
10%
by
the
3-month
assessment
and
11%
at
the
1-year
assessment
Although
the
rates
at
the
1-year
assessment
tended
to
be
higher
for
low
birth
weight
and
preterm
infants
no
significant
group
differences
were
observed
Since
the
prevalence
rates
in
this
study
are
similar
to
those
reported
several
decades
ago
these
data
provide
no
evidence
that
the
rate
of
cryptorchidism
has
increased
either
at
birth
or
by
1
year
of
age
Furthermore
most
testes
that
descend
spontaneously
do
so
within
the
first
3
months
after
the
expected
date
of
delivery
