Title
A
systematic
review
of
the
evidence
regarding
efficacy
of
obesity
prevention
interventions
among
adults
Abstract
Text
In
the
past
interventions
aimed
at
reducing
obesity
have
mainly
targeted
at
weight
loss
treatment
in
obese
adults
with
limited
long-term
effects
With
the
increasing
number
of
people
being
obese
and
being
at
risk
for
obesity
there
has
been
a
shift
in
focus
towards
prevention
of
obesity
We
conducted
a
systematic
review
of
the
peer-reviewed
literature
on
the
efficacy
of
obesity
prevention
interventions
in
adults
in
order
to
identify
effective
interventions
and
intervention
elements
Pubmed
OVID
and
Web
of
Science
databases
were
searched
from
January
1996
to
June
2006
Interventions
aimed
at
primary
prevention
of
weight
gain
among
adults
achieved
by
focusing
on
dietary
intake
physical
activity
or
the
combination
of
both
were
included
The
outcome
measure
had
to
be
difference
in
change
in
body
mass
index
or
body
weight
between
the
intervention
and
the
control
groups
Nine
studies
were
included
five
long-term
studies
(at
least
1
year)
and
four
short-term
(3
months
to
1
year)
Seven
studies
evaluated
an
intervention
that
focused
on
a
combination
of
diet
and
physical
activity
to
prevent
weight
gain
one
on
diet
only
and
one
on
physical
activity
only
One
dietary
intervention
(long-term)
and
three
combined
dietary
and
physical
activity
interventions
(one
long-term
and
two
short-term)
produced
significantly
positive
results
at
end
of
follow-up
The
two
long-term
effective
interventions
consisted
of
intensive
and
long-term
intervention
implementation
including
groups
sessions
designed
to
promote
behavioural
changes
The
current
evidence
of
efficacy
of
obesity
prevention
interventions
is
based
on
a
very
small
number
of
studies
Some
studies
showed
a
positive
impact
on
body
mass
index
or
weight
status
but
there
was
too
much
heterogeneity
in
terms
of
study
design
theoretical
underpinning
and
target
population
to
draw
firm
conclusions
about
which
intervention
approaches
are
more
effective
than
others
More
research
is
urgently
needed
to
extend
the
body
of
evidence
