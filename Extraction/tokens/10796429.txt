Title
Bed
rest
for
acute
low
back
pain
and
sciatica
Abstract
Text
Low
back
pain
is
a
common
reason
for
consulting
a
general
practitioner
and
advice
on
daily
activities
constitutes
an
important
part
in
the
primary
care
management
of
low
back
pain
To
assess
the
effects
of
bed
rest
for
patients
with
acute
low
back
pain
or
sciatica
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Musculoskeletal
Group
trial
register
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
MEDLINE
Embase
Sport
Scisearch
and
reference
lists
of
relevant
articles
We
also
contacted
authors
of
relevant
articles

We
included
all
randomised
studies
or
quasi
randomised
studies
where
at
least
one
comparison
group
of
adult
patients
with
acute
low
back
pain
with
or
without
radiation
of
pain
below
the
knee
was
advised
to
rest
in
bed
for
at
least
two
days
and
one
group
was
not
or
where
comparison
groups
were
advised
to
stay
in
bed
for
different
lengths
of
time
The
main
outcomes
of
interest
were
pain
functional
status
recovery
and
return
to
work
Two
reviewers
independently
selected
trials
for
inclusion
assessed
the
validity
of
included
trials
and
extracted
data
Investigators
were
contacted
to
obtain
missing
information
Nine
trials
with
a
total
of
1435
patients
were
included
Five
trials
met
all
four
validity
criteria
and
were
assessed
to
have
low
risk
of
bias
while
four
trials
were
assessed
to
have
moderate
to
high
risk
of
bias
Four
trials
compared
bed
rest
with
advice
to
stay
active
and
overall
the
results
were
heterogeneous
Overall
results
from
two
high
quality
studies
indicate
no
difference
in
pain
intensity
at
three
weeks
follow-up
[Standardized
Mean
Difference
00
(95%CI
-03
02)]
and
a
small
difference
in
functional
status
in
favour
of
staying
active
[Weighted
Mean
Difference
32
(on
a
0-100
scale)
(95%CI
06
58)]
Two
high
quality
trials
reported
no
differences
in
pain
intensity
between
two
to
three
days
of
bed
rest
and
seven
days
of
bed
rest
Another
two
high-quality
trials
found
no
differences
between
bed
rest
and
exercises
in
pain
intensity
or
functional
status
Bed
rest
compared
to
acvice
to
stay
active
will
at
best
have
small
effects
and
at
worst
might
have
small
harmful
effects
on
acute
LBP
Differences
in
effects
of
advice
to
stay
in
bed
compared
with
advice
to
stay
active
are
small
for
patients
with
low
back
pain
with
or
without
sciatica
There
is
not
an
important
difference
in
the
effects
of
bed
rest
compared
with
exercises
in
the
treatment
of
acute
low
back
pain
or
seven
days
compared
with
two
to
three
days
of
bed
rest
in
patients
with
low
back
pain
of
different
duration
with
and
without
radiating
pain
