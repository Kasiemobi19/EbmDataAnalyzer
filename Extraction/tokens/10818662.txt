Title
Should
sexual
partners
of
women
with
bacterial
vaginosis
receive
treatment
Abstract
Text
Bacterial
vaginosis
is
the
most
prevalent
infectious
cause
of
vaginitis
It
is
associated
with
significant
morbidity
particularly
in
pregnant
women
and
following
gynaecological
operations
Cure
is
difficult
There
is
some
controversy
over
whether
treating
sexual
partners
of
affected
women
can
improve
cure
rates
This
paper
provides
a
critical
appraisal
of
the
evidence
for
simultaneously
treating
the
male
partner
of
women
affected
by
bacterial
vaginosis
Unfortunately
no
evidence
was
found
supporting
the
treatment
of
partners
of
women
affected
by
bacterial
vaginosis
