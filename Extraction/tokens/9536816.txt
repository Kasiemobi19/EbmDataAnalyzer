Abstract
Text
Knowledge
on
the
clinical
course
of
low
back
pain
presented
in
general
practice
is
poor
Preceding
studies
offer
a
fragmentary
view
only
whereas
further
knowledge
is
important
to
enable
the
assessment
of
the
prognosis
The
object
of
this
study
is
to
investigate
the
course
of
low
back
pain
presented
in
general
practice
to
enable
the
assessment
of
the
prognosis
A
one
year
follow
up
study
on
the
clinical
course
of
low
back
pain
in
consecutive
cases
receiving
usual
care
in
general
practice
During
a
period
of
two
years
15
general
practitioners
from
Amsterdam
and
surrounding
areas
included
consecutive
patients
with
both
chronic
and
recent
onset
low
back
pain
After
the
initial
visit
each
patient
was
monitored
for
a
period
of
12
months
The
follow
up
consisted
of
monthly
postal
questionnaires
on
the
course
of
the
low
back
pain
and
the
related
disability
A
total
of
443
of
605
patients
identified
were
included
in
the
follow
up
which
was
fully
completed
by
269
patients
In
general
patients
with
less
serious
low
back
pain
participated
less
often
or
did
not
complete
the
follow
up
At
12
weeks
35%
and
at
the
end
of
the
follow
up
10%
of
the
population
respectively
still
suffered
from
low
back
pain
Both
the
pain
and
the
disability
seemed
to
diminish
quickly
after
the
initial
visit
and
both
seemed
to
stabilise
at
a
lower
level
if
the
low
back
pain
did
not
disappear
completely
About
three
of
four
patients
whose
pain
disappeared
before
the
end
of
the
follow
up
endured
one
or
more
relapses
within
a
year
The
median
time
to
a
relapse
was
about
seven
weeks
and
its
median
duration
about
six
weeks
Both
the
pain
and
the
disability
turned
out
to
be
less
severe
during
relapses
The
median
time
to
recovery
for
patients
whose
low
back
pain
developed
more
than
seven
weeks
before
the
initial
visit
was
four
weeks
longer
than
for
patients
with
more
recently
developed
low
back
pain
at
the
initial
visit
The
clinical
course
of
low
back
pain
presented
in
general
practice
for
the
most
patients
clearly
is
less
favourable
than
expected
It
takes
more
than
just
a
few
weeks
to
recover
and
relapses
occur
within
a
year
in
most
cases
Fortunately
both
the
pain
and
the
disability
quickly
diminish
even
if
the
low
back
pain
does
not
resolve
within
a
few
weeks
