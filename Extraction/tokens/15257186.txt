Equivalence
of
indapamide
SR
and
enalapril
on
microalbuminuria
reduction
in
hypertensive
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
the
NESTOR
Study
Abstract
Text
To
test
whether
microalbuminuria
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
and
hypertension
is
primarily
dependent
on
the
severity
of
hypertension
and
to
compare
the
effectiveness
of
two
antihypertensive
drugs
with
opposite
effects
on
the
renin-angiotensin
system
[the
diuretic
indapamide
sustained
release
(SR)
and
an
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
enalapril]
in
reducing
microalbuminuria
A
multinational
multicentre
controlled
double-blind
double-dummy
randomized
two-parallel-groups
study
over
1
year
After
a
4-week
placebo
run-in
period
570
patients
(ages
600
+/-
99
years
64%
men)
with
type
2
diabetes
essential
hypertension
[systolic
blood
pressure
(SBP)
140-180
mmHg
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
(DBP)
<
110
mmHg]
and
persistent
microalbuminuria
(20-200
microg/min)
were
allocated
randomly
to
groups
to
receive
indapamide
SR
15
mg
(n
=
284)
or
enalapril
10
mg
(n
=
286)
once
a
day
Amlodipine
atenolol
or
both
were
added
if
necessary
to
achieve
the
target
blood
pressure
of
140/85
mmHg
There
was
a
significant
reduction
in
the
urinary
albumin

creatinine
ratio
Mean
reductions
were
35%
[95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
24
to
43]
and
39%
(95%
CI
30
to
47%)
in
the
indapamide
SR
and
enalapril
groups
respectively
Equivalence
was
demonstrated
between
the
two
groups
[108
(95%
CI
089
to
131%)
P
=
001]
The
reductions
in
mean
arterial
pressure
(MAP)
were
166
+/-
90
mmHg
for
the
indapamide
SR
group
and
150
+/-
91
mmHg
for
the
enalapril
group
(NS)
the
reduction
in
SBP
was
significantly
greater
(P
=
00245
)
with
indapamide
SR
More
than
50%
of
patients
in
each
group
required
additional
antihypertensive
therapy
with
no
differences
between
groups
Both
treatments
were
well
tolerated
Indapamide-SR-based
therapy
is
equivalent
to
enalapril-based
therapy
in
reducing
microalbuminuria
with
effective
blood
pressure
reduction
in
patients
with
hypertension
and
type
2
diabetes
