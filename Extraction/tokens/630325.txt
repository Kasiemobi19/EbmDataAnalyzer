Haemoglobin
AIc
concentrations
after
initial
insulin
treatment
for
newly
discovered
diabetes
Abstract
Text
Glycosylated
haemoglobins
AIa+Ib
and
AIc
were
measured
serially
in
10
consecutive
cases
of
newly
discovered
non-acidotic
diabetes
before
and
after
diet
and
insulin
treatment
The
average
concentration
of
Hb
AIc
was
114%
in
untreated
diabetics
as
compared
with
43%
in
healthy
controls
With
prolonged
optimal
regulation
of
blood
glucose
Hb
AIc
slowly
decreased
to
a
mean
concentration
of
55%
The
concentration
of
Hb
AIc
was
significantly
correlated
with
the
fasting
blood
sugar
value
The
findings
suggest
that
determining
Hb
AIc
may
give
valuable
information
on
the
regulation
of
carbohydrate
metabolism
in
the
preceding
one
to
two
months
and
thus
become
an
important
aid
to
management
