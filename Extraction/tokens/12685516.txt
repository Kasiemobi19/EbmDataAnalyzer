Title
Forty
years
of
methylphenidate
treatment
in
Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity
Disorder
Abstract
Text
This
paper
reviews
approximately
40
years
of
stimulant
drug
treatment
of
children
with
behavior
and
learning
problems
These
patients
generally
fall
under
the
rubric
of
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder
(ADHD)
with
core
symptoms
of
hyperactivity
impulsivity
and
inattention
being
the
most
studied
and
most
robust
of
the
targets
for
stimulant
treatment
In
addition
the
drug
effects
on
other
targets
such
as
cognitive
and
academic
function
are
included
The
largest
selection
of
studies
involves
methylphenidate
Both
qualitative
studies
and
meta-analytic
studies
from
major
reviews
are
examined
Variations
in
the
methodology
of
the
reviews
are
described
and
some
of
the
discrepancies
in
interpretation
examined
Despite
wide
variations
in
subject
selection
types
of
trials
degree
of
methodological
rigor
and
the
decade
in
which
the
studies
took
place
the
evidence
is
remarkably
consistent
The
overall
results
suggest
significant
clinical
impact
upon
the
core
features
of
ADHD
More
studies
of
long-term
effects
and
special
populations
such
as
older
adolescents
and
adults
will
be
necessary
though
existing
evidence
strongly
supports
similar
findings
as
for
the
younger
patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
ADHD
