Long-term
effects
of
inhaled

on
FEV1
in
patients

chronic

A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
There
is
no
consensus
on
the
effectiveness
of
inhaled
corticosteroids
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD)
To
evaluate
the
long-term
effects
of
inhaled
corticosteroids
on
the
rate
of
FEV1
decline
in
patients
with
COPD
MEDLINE
EMBASE
CISCOM
and
AMED
databases
and
the
Cochrane
Library
(1966
to
December
2002)
reference
lists
from
identified
articles
and
consultation
with
experts
Searches
were
not
limited
to
the
English
language
Randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
that
examined
the
rate
of
FEV1
decline
as
a
primary
outcome
in
patients
with
COPD
Two
reviewers
independently
extracted
the
data
by
using
predetermined
criteria
For
the
six
studies
that
met
the
inclusion
criteria
the
summary
estimate
for
the
difference
in
FEV1
decline
between
the
placebo
and
treatment
groups
was
-50
+/-
32
mL/y
(95%
CI
-112
to
12
mL/y
P
=
011)
The
use
of
inhaled
corticosteroids
was
not
associated
with
the
rate
of
FEV1
decline
in
3571
patients
followed
for
24
to
54
months
