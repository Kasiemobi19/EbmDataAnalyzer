Title
Antibiotic
regimens
for
management
of
intraamniotic
infection
Abstract
Text
Intraamniotic
infection
is
associated
with
maternal
morbidity
and
neonatal
sepsis
pneumonia
and
death
Although
antibiotic
treatment
is
accepted
as
the
standard
of
care
few
studies
have
been
conducted
to
examine
the
effectiveness
of
different
antibiotic
regimens
for
this
infection
and
whether
to
administer
antibiotics
intrapartum
or
postpartum
To
study
the
effects
of
different
maternal
antibiotic
regimens
for
intraamniotic
infection
on
maternal
and
perinatal
morbidity
and
mortality
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group
trials
register
(May
2002)
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
2
2002)
Trials
where
there
was
a
randomized
comparison
of
different
antibiotic
regimens
to
treat
women
with
a
diagnosis
of
intraamniotic
infection
were
included
The
primary
outcome
was
perinatal
morbidity
Data
were
extracted
from
each
publication
independently
by
the
authors
Two
eligible
trials
(181
women)
were
included
in
this
review
No
trials
were
identified
that
compared
antibiotic
treatment
with
no
treatment
Intrapartum
treatment
with
antibiotics
for
intraamniotic
infection
was
associated
with
a
reduction
in
neonatal
sepsis
(relative
risk
(RR)
008
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
000
144)
and
pneumonia
(RR
015
CI
001
292)
compared
with
treatment
given
immediately
postpartum
but
these
results
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
(number
of
women
studied
=
45)
There
was
no
difference
in
the
incidence
of
maternal
bacteremia
(RR
219
CI
025
1948)
There
was
no
difference
in
the
outcomes
of
neonatal
sepsis
(RR
216
CI
020
2321)
or
neonatal
death
(RR
072
CI
012
416)
between
a
regimen
with
and
without
anaerobic
activity
(number
of
women
studied
=
133)
There
was
a
trend
towards
a
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
post-partum
endometritis
in
women
who
received
treatment
with
ampicillin
gentamicin
and
clindamycin
compared
with
ampicillin
and
gentamicin
alone
but
this
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
(RR
054
CI
019
149)
The
conclusions
that
can
be
drawn
from
this
meta-analysis
are
limited
due
to
the
small
number
of
studies
For
none
of
the
outcomes
was
a
statistically
significant
difference
seen
between
the
different
interventions
Current
consensus
is
for
the
intrapartum
administration
of
antibiotics
when
the
diagnosis
of
intraamniotic
infection
is
made
however
the
results
of
this
review
neither
support
nor
refute
this
although
there
was
a
trend
towards
improved
neonatal
outcomes
when
antibiotics
were
administered
intrapartum
No
recommendations
can
be
made
on
the
most
appropriate
antimicrobial
regimen
to
choose
to
treat
intraamniotic
infection
