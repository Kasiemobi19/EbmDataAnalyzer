Title
Rizatriptan
for
acute
migraine
Abstract
Text
There
are
a
number
of
different
drug
treatments
for
acute
migraine
including
currently
four
triptans
with
several
more
likely
to
become
available
in
the
future
There
is
a
need
for
evidence-based
information
to
help
determine
the
balance
of
benefit
and
harm
for
acute
migraine
treatment
To
quantitatively
assess
the
efficacy
of
a
single
dose
of
rizatriptan
(Maxalt)
for
treating
a
single
migraine
attack
using
the
outcomes
of
headache
response
and
pain-free
response
at
half-an-hour
one
hour
two
hours
and
sustained
relief
over
24
hours
To
express
efficacy
in
terms
of
numbers-needed-to-treat
(NNTs)
Trials
were
identified
by
searching
MEDLINE
(1966-July
2000)

Main

considered
were

iv)

v)

Minor
outcomes
were
headache

and
pain-free
response
at
half-an-hour
and
four
hours
and
pain-free
response
at
one
hour
Dichotomous

data
were
extracted
and
used
to
calculate
the
relative

(RB)
and
number-needed-to-treat
(NNT)
for
each
outcome
Seven
trials
met
our
inclusion
criteria
with
2626
patients
given
rizatriptan
and
902
given
placebo
Significant
benefit
of
rizatriptan
over
placebo
was
shown
for
both
doses
of
rizatriptan
(5
mg
and
10
mg)
for
all
five
main
efficacy
outcomes
(ranging
from
one
to
24
hours)
A
dose
response
was
seen
for
the
main
outcomes
It
was
not
possible
to
analyse
adverse
effects

a
meaningful
way
Rizatriptan
5
mg
and
10
mg
are
effective
in
treating
acute
migraine
with
a
dose-related
increase
in
efficacy
