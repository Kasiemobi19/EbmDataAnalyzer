Effect

aerobic

blood

a

Abstract
Text
Physical
activity
has
been
associated
with
reduced
blood
pressure
in
observational
epidemiologic
studies
and
individual
clinical
trials
This
meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
was
conducted
to
determine
the
effect
of
aerobic
exercise
on
blood
pressure

54
randomized
controlled
trials
(2419
participants)
whose
intervention
and
control
groups
differed
only
in
aerobic
exercise
Using
a
standardized
protocol
and
data
extraction
form
three
of
the
investigators
independently
abstracted
data
on
study
design
sample
size
participant
characteristics
type
of
intervention
follow-up
duration
and
treatment
outcomes
In
a
random-effects
model
data
from
each
trial
were
pooled
and
weighted
by
the
inverse
of
the
total
variance
Aerobic
exercise
was
associated
with
a
significant
reduction
in
mean
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
(-384
mm
Hg
[95%
CI
-497
to
-272
mm
Hg]
and
-258
mm
Hg
[CI
-335
to
-181
mm
Hg]
respectively)
A
reduction
in
blood
pressure
was
associated
with
aerobic
exercise
in
hypertensive
participants
and
normotensive
participants
and
in
overweight
participants
and
normal-weight
participants
Aerobic
exercise
reduces
blood
pressure
in
both
hypertensive
and
normotensive
persons
An
increase
in
aerobic
physical
activity
should
be
considered
an
important
component
of
lifestyle
modification
for
prevention
and
treatment
of
high
blood
pressure
