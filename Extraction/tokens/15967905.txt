Title
Hospitalization
for
acute
diverticulitis
does
not
mandate
routine
elective
colectomy
Abstract
Text
Previous
studies
suggest
that
elective
colectomy
is
often
required
after
an
episode
of
acute
diverticulitis
Acute
diverticulitis
initially
treated
nonoperatively
does
not
require
elective
colectomy
Retrospective
cohort
study
Twelve
Kaiser
Permanente
hospitals
in
Southern
California
Three
thousand
one
hundred
sixty-five
patients
with
acute
diverticulitis
Colectomy
or
nonoperative
treatment
with
or
without
percutaneous
abscess
drainage
Recurrent
diverticulitis
Emergency
colectomy
was
performed
in
614
patients
(194%)
Nonoperative
treatment
was
initially
used
in
2551
patients
(806%)
Of
these
185
patients
(73%)
had
an
elective
colectomy
and
the
remaining
2366
patients
(927%)
did
not
Factors
associated
with
undergoing
elective
colectomy
compared
with
nonoperative
treatment
were
younger
age
of
the
patient
fewer
comorbidities
and
percutaneous
abscess
drainage
Mean
follow-up
was
89
years
with
a
maximum
of
12
years
After
nonoperative
treatment
314
patients
(133%)
recurred-222
patients
had
a
single
recurrence
and
92
patients
had
a
rerecurrence
After
adjusting
for
other
variables
older
age
(hazard
ratio
>/=50
years
vs
<50
years
=
068
95%
confidence
interval
053-087)
was
associated
with
a
lower
recurrence
whereas
higher
comorbidity
was
associated
with
higher
recurrence
Gender
and
percutaneous
abscess
drainage
had
no
influence
on
recurrence
All
92
rerecurrences
were
treated
nonoperatively
The
risk
of
a
rerecurrence
(293%)
was
significantly
higher
than
a
first
recurrence
(P<001)
Age
gender
Charlson
comorbidity
index
and
percutaneous
abscess
drainage
did
not
predict
rerecurrence
Very
few
patients
with
acute
diverticulitis
treated
nonoperatively
have
recurrence
Younger
age
was
associated
with
recurrence
A
first
recurrence
was
the
only
factor
that
predicted
rerecurrences
The
low
recurrence
rate
argues
against
routine
elective
colectomy
after
successful
nonoperative
management
of
acute
diverticulitis
