Title
MR
imaging
of
knees
having
isolated
and
combined
ligament
injuries
Abstract
Text
Although
clinical
evaluation
and
MR
imaging
both
accurately
reveal
injuries
in
knees
with
isolated
ligament
tears
physical
examination
becomes
progressively
less
reliable
when
multiple
lesions
exist
We
investigated
the
accuracy
of
MR
imaging
of
knees
having
varying
degrees
and
numbers
of
ligament
injuries
We
prospectively
interpreted
the
MR
images
of
340
consecutive
injured
knees
and
compared
these
interpretations
with
the
results
of
subsequent
arthroscopy
or
open
surgery
which
served
as
the
gold
standard
Our
interpretations
of
MR
images
focused
on
five
soft-tissue
supporting
structures
(the
two
cruciate
ligaments
the
two
collateral
ligaments
and
the
patellar
tendon)
and
the
two
menisci
Patients
were
divided
into
three
groups
no
ligament
injuries
single
ligament
injuries
and
multiple
ligament
injuries
Using
MR
imaging
we
found
overall
sensitivity
and
specificity
for
diagnosing
ligament
tears
to
be
94%
and
99%
respectively
when
no
or
one
ligament
was
torn
and
88%
and
84%
respectively
when
two
or
more
supporting
structures
were
torn
The
difference
in
specificity
was
statistically
significant
(p
<
0001)
Sensitivity
for
diagnosing
meniscal
tears
decreased
as
the
number
of
injured
structures
increased
but
the
relationship
achieved
statistical
significance
(p
=
001)
only
for
the
medial
meniscus
For
all
categories
of
injury
MR
imaging
was
more
accurate
than
clinical
evaluation
statistics
for
which
were
taken
from
the
orthopedic
literature
In
knees
with
multiple
ligament
injuries
the
diagnostic
specificity
of
MR
imaging
for
ligament
tears
decreases
as
does
the
sensitivity
for
medial
meniscal
tears
