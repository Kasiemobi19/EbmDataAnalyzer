a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
hypercholesterolemia
is
an
independent
risk
factor
for
CHD
morbidity
and
mortality
in
persons
aged
65
years
and
above
and
to
quantify
the
magnitude
of
the
association
if
any
using
data
from
follow-up
studies
A
MEDLINE
search
of
all
published
studies
that
evaluated
the
association
between
high
cholesterol
levels
and
CHD
in
persons
aged
65
years
and
above
and
the
relevant
articles
referenced
in
these
studies
were
used
as
sources
of
selected
articles
In
men
aged
65
years
and
above
who
were
followed
from
middle
age
the
RR
for
CHD
incidence
associated
with
10
mmol/L
increase
in
total
cholesterol
was
128
(CI
117-139)
The
RR
for
CHD
mortality
associated
with
a
similar
increase
in
total
cholesterol
was
122
(CI
118-127)
In
elderly
men
followed
from
age
65
and
above
the
RR
was
124
(CI
11-137)
for
CHD
incidence
and
122(CI
115-128)
for
CHD
mortality
In
elderly
women
followed
after
age
65
the
association
between
total
cholesterol
and
CHD
mortality
was
not
significant
For
men
aged
80
years
and
above
at
entry
total
cholesterol
showed
an
inverse
relationship
with
all-cause
mortality
Serum
total
cholesterol
shows
a
positive
association
with
CHD
morbidity
and
mortality
in
men
aged
65
years
and
above
This
may
however
not
hold
true
for
persons
aged
80
years
and
above
