Abstract
Text
Polyethylene
glycol
(PEG)
3350
and
lactulose
were
compared
in
an
unblinded
randomized
crossover
design
for
treatment
of
constipation
in
37
children
aged
2
to
16
years
Subjects
received
lactulose
(13
g/kg/d
divided
twice
daily
up
to
20
g)
or
PEG
3350
(10
g/m2/day)
for
2
weeks
PEG
3350
significantly
decreased
the
total
colonic
transit
time
compared
to
lactulose
(476+/-27
vs
553+/-24
hours
mean
+/-
SE
PEG
3350
vs
lactulose
respectively
p

The
stool
frequency
form
and
the
ease
of
passage
were
similar
for
each
laxative
Polyethylene
glycol
3350
is
an
effective
laxative
for
the
treatment
of
chronic

in
children
