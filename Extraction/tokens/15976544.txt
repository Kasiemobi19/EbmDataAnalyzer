Title
Endometrial
ablation
for
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
Abstract
Text
This
review
evaluates
the
currently
available
evidence
regarding
resectoscopic
endometrial
ablation
(REA)
and
the
various
nonresectoscopic
endometrial
ablation
(NREA)
techniques
used
for
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
Laser
endometrial
ablation
is
now
used
infrequently
largely
because
of
procedure
time
but
also
because
of
the
cost
and
training
associated
with
the
technique
REA
can
be
performed
in
a
wider
spectrum
of
endometrial
cavity
configurations
than
NREA
and
at
least
in
expert
hands
remains
the
gold
standard
Each
of
the
five
available
types
of
NREA
device
possesses
advantages
and
disadvantages
over
the
others
with
respect
to
variables
such
as
treatment
time
required
cervical
dilation
and
size
and
configuration
of
the
endometrial
cavity
All
provide
acceptable
results
that
are
comparable
to
that
of
REA
in
expert
hands
Serious
complications
seem
to
be
less
common
with
NREA
but
uterine
perforation
and
bowel
or
other
visceral
injury
can
still
occur
When
endometrial-ablation
patients
were
followed
for
up
to
5
years
repeat
surgery
rates
ranged
from
20
to
40%
thereby
eroding
both
the
direct
and
indirect
treatment-related
resource
utilization
Levonorgestrel-releasing
intrauterine
devices
demonstrate
similar
clinical
and
patient-satisfaction
outcomes
to
endometrial
ablation
but
can
be
inserted
in
the
office
and
allow
maintenance
of
fertility
Both
REA
and
NREA
provide
at
least
short-
to
intermediate-term
options
to
hysterectomy
for
patients
with
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
and
normal
or
near-normal
endometrial
cavities
Consequently
the
ideal
candidates
are
likely
those
who
are
within
5
years
of
menopause
