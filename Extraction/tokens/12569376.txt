Abstract
Text
Lymphadenopathy
is
common
affecting
patients
of
all
ages
The
current
referral
pattern
for
investigating
patients
with
lymphadenopathy
varies
widely
with
no
universally
practised
pathway
Our
institution
set
up
a
lymph
node
diagnostic
clinic
(LNDC)
accepting
direct
referrals
from
primary
care
physicians
Details
of
clinical
presentation
and
investigations
were
recorded
prospectively
Between
December
1996
and
July
2001
550
patients
were
referred
(M
203
F347)
The
median
age
was
40
years
(range
14-90)
The
median
time
between
initial
referral
and
the
first
clinic
visit
was
6
days
Of
95
patients
diagnosed
to
have
malignant
diseases
the
median
time
from
the
first
clinic
visit
to
reaching
malignant
diagnosis
was
15
days
Multivariate
logistic
regression
analysis
identified
five
significant
predictors
for
malignant
nodes
male
gender
(risk
ratio
(RR)=272
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
163-456)
increasing
age
(RR=105
95%
CI
104-107)
white
ethnicity
(RR=301
95%
CI
119-76)
and
sites
of
lymph
nodes
supraclavicular
region
(RR=372
95%
CI
152-912)
and
>
or
=
2
regions
of
lymph
nodes
(RR=641
95%
CI
282-1458)
Ultrasound
and
fine-needle
aspiration
cytology
of
palpable
lymph
nodes
were
performed
in
154
and
289
patients
respectively
An
accuracy
of
97
and
84%
was
found
respectively
In
conclusion
a
multidisciplinary
lymph
node
diagnostic
clinic
enables
a
rapid
concerted
approach
to
a
common
medical
problem
and
patients
with
malignant
diseases
were
diagnosed
in
a
timely
fashion
