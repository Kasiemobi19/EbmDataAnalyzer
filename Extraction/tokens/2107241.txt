Comparison
of
the
efficacy
and
side
effects
of
aqueous
steroid
nasal
spray
(budesonide)
and
allergen-injection
therapy
(Pollinex-R)
in
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
rhinoconjunctivitis
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
and
side
effects
of
two
approaches
to
the
treatment
of
ragweed
pollen-induced
rhinoconjunctivitis
were
compared
in
a
double-blind
parallel-group
trial
Sixty
ragweed-sensitive
adults
were
randomized
either
to
a
course
of
four
Pollinex-R
hyposensitization
injections
during
the
6
weeks
before
the
ragweed-pollen
season
or
to
budesonide
aqueous
nasal
steroid
spray
400
micrograms
daily
throughout
the
season
A
double-dummy
technique
was
used
to
achieve
blinding
During
the
ragweed-pollen
season
troublesome
nasal
symptoms
were
treated
with
terfenadine
60
mg
when
treatment
was
needed
up
to
240
mg
daily
and
eye
symptoms
were
treated
with
naphazoline
eye
drops
when
treatment
was
needed
up
to
four
times
daily
Every
day
subjects
recorded
the
severity
of
nasal
and
eye
symptoms
and
medication
use
in
a
diary
Fourteen
of
the
subjects
receiving
Pollinex-R
were
unable
to
complete
the
course
of
injections
because
of
systemic
or
large
local
reactions
Eight
subjects
withdrew
during
the
pollen
season
because
of
severe
rhinitis
all
subjects
had
received
Pollinex-R
Subjects
in
the
budesonide-treated
group
had
minimal
nasal
symptoms
and
used
very
little
terfenadine
compared
with
subjects
in
the
Pollinex-R-treated
group
(p
less
than
00001)
Eye
symptoms
and
eye
drop
use
were
similar
in
the
two
treatment
groups
No
clinically
important
side
effects
were
reported
by
the
subjects
receiving
budesonide
The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
aqueous
budesonide
nasal
spray
is
markedly
more
effective
than
Pollinex-R
in
controlling
symptoms
of
seasonal
rhinitis
while
the
side
effects
and
inconvenience
of
immunotherapy
are
avoided
