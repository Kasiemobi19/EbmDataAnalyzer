Carbohydrate
restriction
alters
lipoprotein
metabolism
by
modifying
VLDL
LDL
and
HDL
subfraction
distribution
and
size
in
overweight
men
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effects
of
carbohydrate
restriction
(CR)
with
and
without
soluble
fiber
on
lipoprotein
metabolism
29
men
participated
in
a
12-wk
weight
loss
intervention
Subjects
were
matched
by
age
and
BMI
and
randomly
assigned
to
consume
3
g/d
of
either
a
soluble
fiber
supplement
(n=14)
or
placebo
(n=15)
with
a
macronutrient
energy
distribution
of
approximately
10%
carbohydrate
approximately
65%
fat
and
approximately
25%
protein
Because
the
groups
did
not
differ
in
any
of
the
variables
measured
all
data
were
pooled
and
comparisons
were
made
between
baseline
and
12
wk
After
12
wk
subjects
had
a
mean
weight
loss
of
75
kg
(P<0001)
and
abdominal
fat
was
reduced
by
20%
(P<0001)
Plasma
LDL
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
(TG)
were
significantly
reduced
by
89
and
386%
respectively
Similarly
apolipoproteins
C-I
(-138%)
C-III
(-212%)
and
E
(-125%)
were
significantly
lower
after
the
intervention
In
contrast
plasma
HDL-cholesterol
concentrations
were
increased
by
12%
(P<005)
Changes
in
plasma
TG
were
positively
correlated
with
reductions
in
large
(r=0615
P<001)
and
medium
VLDL
particles
(r=0432
P<005)
and
negatively
correlated
with
LDL
diameter
(r=-0489
P<001)
Changes
in
trunk
fat
were
positively
correlated
with
medium
VLDL
(r=0474
P<00)
and
small
LDL
(r=0405
P<005)
and
negatively
correlated
with
large
HDL
(r=-0556
P<001)
We
conclude
that
weight
loss
induced
by
CR
favorably
alters
the
secretion
and
processing
of
plasma
lipoproteins
rendering
VLDL
LDL
and
HDL
particles
associated
with
decreased
risk
for
atherosclerosis
and
coronary
heart
disease
