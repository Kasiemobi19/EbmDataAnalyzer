Calcium
homeostasis
and
imbalance
Abstract
Text
The
human
body
is
equipped
with
an
efficient
protection
system
against
hypocalcemia
This
system
is
composed
of
parathyroid
glands
bone
kidney
and
intestine
By
appropriate
actions
of
parathyroid
hormone
(PTH)
and
active
vitamin
D
(125-dihydroxyvitamin
D)
a
small
fall
of
extracellular
calcium
ion
concentration
is
instantly
corrected
Thus
a
defect
of
any
step
in
this
system
results
in
the
development
of
hypocalcemia
Overloaded
calcium
either
from
bone
or
intestine
is
efficiently
excreted
into
the
urine
Thus
hypercalcemia
develops
almost
exclusively
when
a
greater
amount
of
calcium
than
the
kidney
can
excrete
is
loaded
In
chronic
dialysis
patients
either
hypocalcemia
or
hypercalcemia
may
develop
because
of
defects
in
these
two
defense
systems
against
calcium
imbalance
