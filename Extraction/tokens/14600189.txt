Abstract
Text
The
care
of
patients
with
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD)
has
changed
radically
over
the
past
2
decades
and
novel
therapies
can
not
only
improve
the
health
status
of
patients
with
COPD
but
also
modify
its
natural
course
To
systematically
review
the
impact
of
long-acting
bronchodilators
inhaled
corticosteroids
nocturnal
noninvasive
mechanical
ventilation
pulmonary
rehabilitation
domiciliary
oxygen
therapy
and
disease
management
programs
on
clinical
outcomes
in
patients
with
COPD
MEDLINE
and
Cochrane
databases
were
searched
to
identify
all
randomized
controlled
trials
and
systematic
reviews
from
1980
to
May
2002
evaluating
interventions
in
patients
with
COPD
We
also
hand
searched
bibliographies
of
relevant
articles
and
contacted
experts
in
the
field
We
included
randomized
controlled
trials
that
had
follow-up
of
at
least
3
months
and
contained
data
on
at
least
1
of
these
clinical
outcomes
health-related
quality
of
life
exacerbations
associated
with
COPD
or
death
For
pulmonary
rehabilitation
we
included
studies
that
had
a
follow-up
of
at
least
6
weeks
Using
standard
meta-analytic
techniques
the
effects
of
interventions
were
compared
with
placebo
or
with
usual
care
In
secondary
analyses
the
effects
of
interventions
were
compared
against
each
other
where
possible
Long-acting
beta2-agonists
and
anticholinergics
(tiotropium)
reduced
exacerbation
rates
by
approximately
20%
to
25%
(relative
risk
[RR]
for
long-acting
beta2-agonists
079
95%
CI
069-090
RR
for
tiotropium
074
95%
CI
062-089)
in
patients
with
moderate
to
severe
COPD
Inhaled
corticosteroids
also
reduced
exacerbation
rates
by
a
similar
amount
(RR
076
95%
CI
072-080)
The
beneficial
effects
were
most
pronounced
in
trials
enrolling
patients
with
FEV1
between
1
L
and
2
L
Combining
a
long-acting
beta2-agonist
with
an
inhaled
corticosteroid
resulted
in
an
approximate
30%
(RR
070
95%
CI
062-078)
reduction
in
exacerbations
Pulmonary
rehabilitation
improved
the
health
status
of
patients
with
moderate
to
severe
disease
but
no
material
effect
was
observed
on
long-term
survival
or
hospitalization
rates
Domiciliary
oxygen
therapy
improved
survival
by
approximately
40%
in
patients
with
PaO2
lower
than
60
mm
Hg
but
not
in
those
without
hypoxia
at
rest
The
data
on
disease
management
programs
were
heterogeneous
but
overall
no
effect
was
observed
on
survival
or
risk
of
hospitalization
Noninvasive
mechanical
ventilation
was
not
associated
with
improved
outcomes
A
significant
body
of
evidence
supports
the
use
of
long-acting
bronchodilators
and
inhaled
corticosteroids
in
reducing
exacerbations
in
patients
with
moderate
to
severe
COPD
Domiciliary
oxygen
therapy
is
the
only
intervention
that
has
been
demonstrated
to
prolong
survival
but
only
in
patients
with
resting
hypoxia
