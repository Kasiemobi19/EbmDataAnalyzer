Abstract
Text
A
4-year
longitudinal
study
of
school-aged
children
was
conducted
to
describe
the
clinical
characteristics
and
epidemiologic
features
of
infections
with
group
A
streptococci
(GAS)
Between
1998
and
2002
surveillance
throat
cultures
were
performed
twice
per
month
(October
to
May)
for
a
cohort
of
elementary
school
children
in
Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania
In
addition
throat
cultures
were
obtained
during
any
respiratory
illness
Erythromycin
and
clindamycin
susceptibility
testing
was
performed
for
all
isolates
Molecular
typing
was
performed
with
field-inversion
gel
electrophoresis
Representative
isolates
from
each
field-inversion
gel
electrophoresis
group
were
emm
typed
Strict
definitions
were
used
to
characterize
each
GAS
infection
Children
were
classified
into
4
categories
each
year
ie
single
episode
recurrent
episodes
carriers
of
GAS
and
no
infections
A
total
of
48
to
100
children
per
year
were
studied
for
4
years
61
(49%)
were
male
The
mean
age
was
96
years
(range
5-15
years)
A
total
of
5658
throat
cultures
were
performed
878
(155%)
were
positive
for
GAS
Antimicrobial
agents
were
used
to
treat
209
episodes
of
infection
Thirteen
emm
types
were
observed
during
the
4-year
period
GAS
were
isolated
most
often
from
children
who
were
carriers
isolates
from
single
episodes
were
next
most
common
Children
carried
a
single
emm
type
for
a
mean
of
108
weeks
(range
3-34
weeks)
Carriers
were
likely
to
be
classified
again
as
carriers
in
subsequent
years
and
frequently
switched
emm
types
Sixty-two
percent
of
the
children
had
>
or
=1
year
with
no
infections
GAS
infections
are
common
among
school-aged
children
The
majority
of
positive
throat
cultures
observed
in
this
longitudinal
study
were
obtained
from
children
who
were
carriers
of
GAS
Carriers
switched
emm
types
but
tended
to
become
carriers
repeatedly
during
the
study
Practitioners
should
consider
treating
children
known
to
be
GAS
carriers
when
they
develop
a
new
illness
that
is
consistent
with
streptococcal
pharyngitis
because
they
may
acquire
new
emm
types
and
be
at
risk
for
rheumatic
heart
disease
