Trends

pertussis
among

in

1980-1999
Abstract
Text
Reported
cases
of
pertussis
among
adolescents
and
adults
have
increased
since
the
1980s
despite
increasingly
high
rates
of
vaccination
among
infants
and
children
However
severe
pertussis
morbidity
and
mortality
occur
primarily
among
infants
To
describe
the
trends
and
characteristics
of
reported
cases
of
pertussis
among
infants
younger
than
12
months
in
the
United
States
from
1980
to
1999
Cases
of
pertussis
in
infants
younger
than
12
months
in
the
United
States
reported
to
the
National
Notifiable
Disease
Surveillance
System
of
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
between
1980
and
1999
and
detailed
case
data
from
the
Supplementary
Pertussis
Surveillance
System
Incidence
and
demographic
and
clinical
characteristics
of
cases
The
incidence
of
reported
cases
of
pertussis
among
infants
increased
49%
in
the
1990s
compared
with
the
incidence
in
the
1980s
(19
798
vs
12
550
cases
reported
511
cases
vs
342
cases
per
100
000
infant
population
respectively)
Increases
in
the
incidence
of
cases
and
the
number
of
deaths
among
infants
during
the
1990s
primarily
were
among
those
aged
4
months
or
younger
contrasting
with
a
stable
incidence
of
cases
among
infants
aged
5
months
or
older
The
proportion
of
cases
confirmed
by
bacterial
culture
was
higher
in
the
1990s
than
in
the
1980s
(50%
and
33%
respectively)
the
proportion
of
hospitalized
cases
was
unchanged
(67%
vs
68%
respectively)
Receipt
of
fewer
doses
of
vaccine
was
associated
with
hospitalization
when
cases
were
stratified
by
age
in
months
The
incidence
of
reported
cases
of
pertussis
among
infants
increased
in
the
1990s
compared
with
the
1980s
The
limited
age
group
affected
the
increased
rate
of
bacteriologic
confirmation
and
the
unchanged
severity
of
illness
suggest
that
an
increase
in
infant
pertussis
has
occurred
apart
from
any
change
in
reporting
Strategies
are
needed
to
prevent
the
morbidity
and
mortality
from
pertussis
among
infants
too
young
to
be
fully
vaccinated
according
to
the
current
recommended
schedules
of
vaccination
in
the
United
States
