Title
Cimetidine
therapy
for
warts
a
placebo-controlled
double-blind
study
Abstract
Text
Cimetidine
an
H2-receptor
antagonist
has
been
used
successfully
to
treat
patients
with
mucocutaneous
candidiasis
common
variable
immunodeficiency
herpes
simplex
and
herpes
zoster
because
of
its
immunomodulatory
effects
Recently
some
trials
have
suggested
that
cimetidine
may
also
be
useful
for
the
treatment
of
warts
The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
whether
cimetidine
is
effective
in
the
treatment
of
warts
Seventy
patients
with
multiple
warts
were
included
in
a
placebo-controlled
double-blind
study
Patients
were
randomly
allocated
to
treatment
groups
equally
The
groups
received
cimetidine
25
to
40
mg/kg
daily
or
placebo
for
3
months
Patients
were
examined
at
monthly
intervals
At
the
end
of
the
therapy
28
cimetidine-treated
and
26
placebo-treated
patients
were
examined
to
determine
the
efficacy
of
treatment
Cure
rates
obtained
were
32%
(9
of
28)
in
the
cimetidine-treated
group
and
307%
(8
of
26)
in
the
placebo-treated
group
No
significant
difference
was
found
between
cimetidine
and
placebo
in
effectiveness
(p
=
085)
Our
results
show
that
cimetidine
is
no
more
effective
than
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
common
warts
