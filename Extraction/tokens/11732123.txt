Abstract
Text
Today
urinalysis
is
one
of
the
most
common
clinical
tests
ordered
for
adult
and
pediatric
patients
Because
urine
specimens
are
usually
readily
available
and
are
obtained
noninvasively
the
urine
testing
is
well
suited
for
children
This
article
discusses
the
most
common
urine
tests
performed
in
children
for
screening
purposes
and
also
less
common
tests
for
diagnosis
of
specific
disorders
Special
considerations
regarding
urine
specimen
collection
in
children
are
discussed
Some
simple
tests
that
are
underused
by
clinicians
are
mentioned
as
are
some
exciting
new
molecular
applications
of
urine
testing
