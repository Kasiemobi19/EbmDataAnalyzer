Efficacy
and
safety
of
tacrolimus
ointment
compared
with
that
of
hydrocortisone
butyrate
ointment
in
adult
patients
with
atopic
dermatitis
Abstract
Text
Vehicle-controlled
studies
have
demonstrated
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
tacrolimus
ointment
for
patients
with
atopic
dermatitis
This
study
was
undertaken
to
compare
003%
and
01%
tacrolimus
ointment
with
01%
hydrocortisone-17-butyrate
ointment
a
midpotent
to
potent
topical
corticosteroid
in
the
treatment
of
adult
patients
with
moderate-to-severe
atopic
dermatitis
Patients
applied
ointment
twice
daily
to
all
affected
areas
for
3
weeks
in
this
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
parallel-group
study
The
primary
endpoint
was
the
modified
eczema
area
and
severity
index
(mEASI)
mean
area
under
the
curve
as
a
percentage
of
baseline
Five
hundred
seventy
patients
were
randomized
and
received
treatment
Discontinuations
included
22
of
193
patients
from
the
003%
tacrolimus
group
22
of
191
patients
from
the
01%
tacrolimus
group
and
17
of
186
patients
from
the
hydrocortisone
butyrate
group
The
median
mEASI
mean
area
under
the
curve
as
a
percentage
of
baseline
was
470%
365%
and
361%
for
patients
who
received
003%
tacrolimus
01%
tacrolimus
and
01%
hydrocortisone
butyrate
respectively
There
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
01%
tacrolimus
and
01%
hydrocortisone
butyrate
however
the
lower
improvement
in
mEASI
for
003%
tacrolimus
was
statistically
significant
when
compared
with
01%
tacrolimus
(P
<001)
or
hydrocortisone
butyrate
(P
=002)
Skin
burning
and
pruritus
at
the
application
site
showed
a
higher
incidence
in
the
tacrolimus
treatment
groups
than
in
the
hydrocortisone
butyrate
group
(P
<05)
Laboratory
parameters
showed
no
treatment
differences
and
no
marked
changes
over
time
The
efficacy
of
01%
tacrolimus
ointment
was
similar
to
that
of
01%
hydrocortisone
butyrate
ointment
and
was
lower
for
003%
tacrolimus
ointment
No
serious
safety
concerns
were
identified
