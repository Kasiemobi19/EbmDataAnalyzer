Title
High
prevalence
of
cobalamin
deficiency
in
elderly
outpatients
Abstract
Text
To
measure
the
prevalence
of
cobalamin
(vitamin
B12)
deficiency
in
geriatric
outpatients
as
documented
by
both
low
serum
cobalamin
levels
and
elevations
of
serum
methylmalonic
acid
and
homocysteine
and
to
determine
the
response
to
cobalamin
treatment
Prospective
study
screening
elderly
subjects
for
cobalamin
deficiency
using
radiodilution
cobalamin
assays
as
well
as
stable
isotope
dilution
gas
chromatography-mass
spectrometry
methylmalonic
acid
and
homocysteine
assays
In
patients
with
serum
cobalamin
levels
<
or
=
300
pg/mL
the
response
to
cobalamin
treatment
in
the
group
with
levels
of
methylmalonic
acid
and/or
homocysteine
>
3
standard
deviations
(SD)
above
the
mean
for
normals
was
compared
with
that
of
those
without
such
elevations
Outpatient
geriatric
clinics
at
the
VA
Medical
Center
and
University
Health
Sciences
Center
Denver
CO
One-hundred
and
fifty-two
consecutive
outpatients
ages
65
to
99
were
screened
Twenty-nine
subjects
with
serum
cobalamin
levels
<
or
=
300
pg/mL
were
prospectively
evaluated
and
treated
with
cobalamin
Cobalamin
methylmalonic
acid
homocysteine
complete
blood
counts
neurologic
examination
and
neuropsychological
testing
The
prevalence
of
cobalamin
deficiency
as
defined
by
a
serum
cobalamin
level
<
or
=
300
pg/mL
and
levels
of
serum
methylmalonic
acid
and/or
homocysteine
elevated
to
>
3
SD
was
145%
of
the
screened
outpatients
A
similar
proportion
of
patients
with
low
normal
serum
cobalamin
levels
(between
201
and
300
pg/mL)
demonstrated
elevated
metabolites
>
3
SD
(56%)
compared
with
patients
with
low
serum
cobalamin
levels
(<
or
=
200
pg/mL)
(62%)
Cobalamin
therapy
caused
a
marked
fall
or
complete
correction
of
the
elevated
methylmalonic
acid
and
homocysteine
levels
in
each
patient
who
was
treated
prospectively
Results
for
complete
blood
count
lactate
dehydrogenase
bilirubin
baseline
neurologic
score
and
baseline
neuropsychologic
scores
did
not
differ
in
the
group
of
patients
with
elevated
metabolites
compared
with
those
with
normal
metabolites
The
mean
red
cell
volume
fell
significantly
in
the
patients
with
elevated
metabolites
after
6
months
of
cobalamin
treatment
One
patient
with
elevated
metabolites
had
marked
improvement
in
his
neurologic
abnormalities
after
6
months
of
cobalamin
treatment
There
was
a
high
(145%)
prevalence
of
cobalamin
deficiency
as
demonstrated
by
elevations
in
serum
methylmalonic
acid
and
homocysteine
in
addition
to
low
or
low
normal
serum
cobalamin
levels
in
elderly
outpatients
The
serum
cobalamin
level
was
insensitive
for
screening
since
similar
numbers
of
patients
with
low
normal
serum
cobalamin
levels
of
201-300
pg/mL
compared
with
patients
with
low
cobalamin
levels
(<
or
=
200
pg/mL)
had
markedly
elevated
metabolites
which
fell
with
cobalamin
treatment
Additional
studies
will
be
required
to
define
the
full
clinical
benefit
from
treatment
with
Cbl
in
elderly
subjects
