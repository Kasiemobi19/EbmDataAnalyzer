Title
Sex
differences
in
outcome
following
sports-related
concussion
Abstract
Text
Females
comprise
an
increasing
percentage
of
the
athlete
population
across
all
age
groups
and
analysis
of
recent
literature
reveals
that
they
sustain
more
concussions
in
collegiate
sports
Results
of
human
and
animal
studies
indicate
that
females
may
have
poorer
outcomes
after
traumatic
brain
injury
however
no
return-to-play
guideline
takes
sex
or
other
individual
differences
into
account
In
the
present
study
the
authors
evaluated
the
influence
of
patient
sex
on
objective
neurocognitive
performance
and
subjective
reporting
of
symptoms
following
sports-related
concussion
According
to
preseason
baseline
neurocognitive
computerized
testing
in
2340
male
and
female
high
school
and
collegiate
athletes
individuals
who
sustained
sports-related
concussions
(155
persons)
were
reevaluated
using
an
alternate
form
of
the
cognitive
test
Sex
differences
in
the
magnitude
of
cognitive
change
from
baseline
levels
and
the
subjective
experience
of
symptoms
were
analyzed
To
account
for
the
possible
protective
effects
of
helmets
comparisons
were
performed
among
females
males
with
helmets
and
males
without
helmets
none
of
the
female
athletes
wore
helmets
Female
athletes
had
significantly
greater
declines
in
simple
and
complex
reaction
times
relative
to
preseason
baseline
levels
and
they
reported
more
postconcussion
symptoms
compared
with
males
As
a
group
females
were
cognitively
impaired
approximately
17
times
more
frequently
than
males
following
concussions
Furthermore
females
experienced
more
objective
and
subjective
adverse
effects
from
concussion
even
after
adjusting
for
the
use
of
helmets
by
some
groups
of
male
athletes
(for
example
in
football)
Return-to-play
decisions
and
concussion
management
must
be
objective
and
made
on
an
individual
basis
including
consideration
of
factors
such
as
patient
sex
rather
than
relying
on
a
one-size-fits-all
guideline
