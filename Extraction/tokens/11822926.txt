Title
Prevention
of
contrast
media-associated
nephropathy
randomized
comparison
of
2
hydration
regimens
in
1620
patients
undergoing
coronary
angioplasty
Abstract
Text
The
administration
of
radiographic
contrast
agents
remains
an
important
cause
of
acute
renal
failure
The
optimal
infusion
for
hydration
has
not
been
evaluated
To
compare
the
incidence
of
contrast
media-associated
nephrotoxicity
with
isotonic
or
half-isotonic
hydration
Prospective
randomized
controlled
open-label
study
Patients
scheduled
for
elective
or
emergency
coronary
angioplasty
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
isotonic
(09%
saline)
or
half-isotonic
(045%
sodium
chloride
plus
5%
glucose)
hydration
beginning
the
morning
of
the
procedure
for
elective
interventions
and
immediately
before
emergency
interventions
An
increase
in
serum
creatinine
of
at
least
05
mg/dL
(44
micromol/L)
within
48
hours
was
defined
as
contrast
media-associated
nephrotoxicity
Secondary
end
points
were
cardiac
and
peripheral
vascular
complications
A
total
of
1620
patients
were
assigned
to
receive
isotonic
(n
=
809)
or
half-isotonic
(n
=
811)
hydration
Primary
end
point
analysis
was
possible
in
1383
patients
Baseline
characteristics
were
well
matched
Contrast
media-associated
nephropathy
was
significantly
reduced
with
isotonic
(07%
95%
confidence
interval
01%-14%)
vs
half-isotonic
(20%
95%
confidence
interval
10%-31%)
hydration
(P
=04)
Three
predefined
subgroups
benefited
in
particular
from
isotonic
hydration
women
persons
with
diabetes
and
patients
receiving
250
mL
or
more
of
contrast
The
incidence
of
cardiac
(isotonic
53%
vs
half-isotonic
64%
P
=59)
and
peripheral
vascular
(isotonic
16%
vs
half-isotonic
15%
P
=93)
complications
was
similar
between
the
2
hydration
groups
Isotonic
hydration
is
superior
to
half-isotonic
hydration
in
the
prevention
of
contrast
media-associated
nephropathy
