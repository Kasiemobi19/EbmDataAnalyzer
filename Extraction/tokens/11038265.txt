effective
Meta-analysis
of
the
prospective
trials
Abstract
Text
The
objective
was
to
review
the
evidence
of
effectiveness
of
the
polyvalent
polysaccharide
pneumococcal
vaccine
from
prospective
properly
randomised
controlled
trials
comparing
pneumococcal
vaccines
with
placebo
in
subjects
who
are
immunocompetent
and
those
likely
to
have
an
impaired
immune
system
Databases
searched
included
the
Cochrane
Library
(issue

2000)
MEDLINE
(1966-August
2000)
PubMed
(to
August
2000)
and
EMBASE
(
to
August
2000)
Reference
lists
of
reports
and
reviews
were
also
searched
To
be
included
in
the
analysis
a
study
had
to
have
been
a
prospective
randomised
comparison
of
a
polysaccharide
pneumococcal
vaccine
(any
valency)
and
to
have
a
placebo
or
no
treatment
comparison
group
Papers
had
to
report
important
clinical
outcomes
such
as
rates
of
pneumonia
pneumococcal
pneumonia
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
pneumonia
deaths
or
bacteraemia
Serological
outcomes
were
not
sought
Thirteen
randomised
comparisons
with
over
45000
subjects
were
identified
in
an
extensive
literature
review
Eight
studies
had
a
quality
score
of
3
or
more
on
a
scale
of
1
to
5
In
three
comparisons
with
21152
immunocompetent
subjects
(South
African
gold
miners
New
Guinea
highlanders)
pneumococcal
vaccination
was
effective
in
reducing
the
incidence
of
all-cause
pneumonia
(relative
risk

047
to

pneumococcal

(016

pneumonia
deaths
(070

to

and

(018

In
ten
comparisons
in
over
24000
people
who
were
elderly
or
likely
to
have
impaired
immune
systems
pneumococcal
vaccination
was
without
effect
for
any
outcome
Present
guidelines
recommend
pneumococcal
vaccination
for
"high-risk"
groups
There
is
no
evidence
from
randomised
trials
that
this
is
of
any
benefit
