Comparison
of
podophyllin
application
with
simple
surgical
excision
in
clearance
and
recurrence
of
perianal
condylomata
acuminata
Abstract
Text
60
patients
with
first-episode
perianal
condylomata
acuminata
were
randomly
assigned
to
podophyllin
application
or
surgical
excision
58%
of
the
male
patients
were
homosexual
and
33%
of
the
female
patients
regularly
had
anal
intercourse
Podophyllin
completely
cleared
warts
from
23
of
30
(766%)
patients
compared
with
28
of
30
(933%)
for
surgical
excision
After
wart
clearance
the
cumulative
recurrence
rates
were
18%
for
surgical
excision
and
43%
for
podophyllin
at
3
months
(p
less
than
005)
22%
and
56%
at
6
months
(p
less
than
001)
26%
and
56%
at
9
months
(p
less
than
001)
and
29%
and
65%
at
12
months
(p
less
than
001)
All
patients
were
treated
as
outpatients
and
all
surgical
procedures
were
carried
out
under
local
anaesthesia
Both
regimens
were
well
tolerated
