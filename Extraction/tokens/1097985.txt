Text
A
double-blind
trial
of

amphotericin
B
and
a
placebo
was
carried
out
in
fifty-two
cases
of
denture-related
candidiasis
and/or
angular
cheilitis
The
drugs
effected
a
significant
clinical
cure
but
recurrence
of
the
signs
was
common
after
withdrawal
of
the
drugs
Concurrent
bacteriologic
examination
showed
few
cures
and
continued
presence
of
Candida
albicans
during
the
trial
A
specimen
from
a
red

examined
histologically
