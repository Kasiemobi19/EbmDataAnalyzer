Title
The
probability
of
malignancy
in
solitary
pulmonary
nodules
Application
to
small
radiologically
indeterminate
nodules
Abstract
Text
A
clinical
prediction
model
to
identify
malignant
nodules
based
on
clinical
data
and
radiological
characteristics
of
lung
nodules
was
derived
using
logistic
regression
from
a
random
sample
of
patients
(n
=
419)
and
tested
on
data
from
a
separate
group
of
patients
(n
=
210)
To
use
multivariate
logistic
regression
to
estimate
the
probability
of
malignancy
in
radiologically
indeterminate
solitary
pulmonary
nodules
(SPNs)
in
a
clinically
relevant
subset
of
patients
with
SPNs
that
measured
between
4
and
30
mm
in
diameter
A
retrospective
cohort
study
at
a
multispecialty
group
practice
included
629
patients
(320
men
309
women)
with
newly
discovered
(between
January
1
1984
and
May
1
1986)
4-
to
30-mm
radiologically
indeterminate
SPNs
on
chest
radiography
Patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
cancer
within
5
years
prior
to
the
discovery
of
the
nodule
were
excluded
Clinical
data
included
age
sex
cigarette-smoking
status
and
history
of
extrathoracic
malignant
neoplasm
asbestos
exposure
and
chronic
interstitial
or
obstructive
lung
disease
chest
radiological
data
included
the
diameter
location
edge
characteristics
(eg
lobulation
spiculation
and
shagginess)
and
other
characteristics
(eg
cavitation)
of
the
SPNs
Predictors
were
identified
in
a
random
sample
of
two
thirds
of
the
patients
and
tested
in
the
remaining
one
third
Sixty-five
percent
of
the
nodules
were
benign
23%
were
malignant
and
12%
were
indeterminate
Three
clinical
characteristics
(age
cigarette-smoking
status
and
history
of
cancer
[diagnosis
>
or
=
5
years
ago])
and
3
radiological
characteristics
(diameter
spiculation
and
upper
lobe
location
of
the
SPNs)
were
independent
predictors
of
malignancy
The
area
(+/-SE)
under
the
evaluated
receiver
operating
characteristic
curve
was
08328
+/-
00226
Three
clinical
and
3
radiographic
characteristics
predicted
the
malignancy
in
radiologically
indeterminate
SPNs
