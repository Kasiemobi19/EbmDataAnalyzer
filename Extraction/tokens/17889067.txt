Solid
food
introduction
in
relation
to
eczema
results
from
a
four-year
prospective
birth
cohort
study
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
association
between
the
introduction
of
solid
foods
in
the
first
12
months
and
the
occurrence
of
eczema
during
the
first
4
years
of
life
in
a
prospective
study
of
newborns
Data
were
taken
from
annually
administered
questionnaires
from
a
large
birth
cohort
(recruited
1995-1998)
comprised
of
an
intervention
and
a
nonintervention
group
Outcomes
were
doctor-diagnosed
and
symptomatic
eczema
Multiple
generalized
estimation
equation
models
were
performed
for
the
2
study
groups
From
the
5991
recruited
infants
4753
(79%)
were
followed
up
The
2
study
groups
were
different
in
their
family
risk
of
allergies
and
feeding
practices
No
association
was
found
between
the
time
of
introduction
of
solids
or
the
diversity
of
solids
and
eczema
In
the
nonintervention
group
a
decreased
risk
was
observed
for
avoidance
of
soybean/nuts
but
an
increased
risk
was
seen
in
doctor-diagnosed
eczema
for
the
avoidance
of
egg
in
the
first
year
The
evidence
from
this
study
supports
neither
a
delayed
introduction
of
solids
beyond
the
fourth
month
nor
a
delayed
introduction
of
the
most
potentially
allergenic
solids
beyond
the
sixth
month
of
life
for
the
prevention
of
eczema
However
effects
under
more
extreme
conditions
cannot
be
ruled
out
