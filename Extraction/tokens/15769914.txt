Aerobic
walking
or
strengthening
exercise
for
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
A
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
efficacy
of
aerobic
walking
and
home
based
quadriceps
strengthening
exercises
in
patients
with
knee
osteoarthritis
The
Medline
Pubmed
EMBASE
CINAHL
and
PEDro
databases
and
the
Cochrane
controlled
trials
register
were
searched
for
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
of
subjects
with
knee
osteoarthritis
comparing
aerobic
walking
or
home
based
quadriceps
strengthening
exercise
with
a
non-exercise
control
group
Methodological
quality
of
retrieved
RCTs
was
assessed
Outcome
data
were
abstracted
for
pain
and
self
reported
disability
and
the
effect
size
calculated
for
each
outcome
RCTs
were
grouped
according
to
exercise
mode
and
the
data
pooled
using
both
fixed
and
random
effects
models
35
RCTs
were
identified
13
of
which
met
inclusion
criteria
and
provided
data
suitable
for
further
analysis
Pooled
effect
sizes
for
pain
were
052
for
aerobic
walking
and
039
for
quadriceps
strengthening
For
self
reported
disability
pooled
effect
sizes
were
046
for
aerobic
walking
and
032
for
quadriceps
strengthening
Both
aerobic
walking
and
home
based
quadriceps
strengthening
exercise
reduce
pain
and
disability
from
knee
osteoarthritis
but
no
difference
between
them
was
found
on
indirect
comparison
