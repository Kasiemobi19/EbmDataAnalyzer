Abstract
Text
Previous
epidemiologic
studies
have
suggested
that
sunscreen
use
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
melanoma
skin
cancer
Because
high
nevi
(mole)
count
in
adults
is
a
strong
predictor
of
melanoma
we
conducted
a
study
examining
the
number
of
nevi
in
6-
to
7-year-old
European
children
according
to
their
sunscreen
use
Whole-body
and
site-specific
counts
of
nevi
2
mm
or
larger
were
performed
in
631
children
in
their
first
year
of
primary
school
in
four
European
cities
Independently
parents
were
interviewed
regarding
sun
exposure
sunscreen
use
and
physical
sun
protection
of
their
child
After
adjustment
for
sun
exposure
and
host
characteristics
(eg
skin
phototype
eye
color)
the
relative
risk
for
high
nevus
count
on
the
trunk
was
168
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
=
109-259)
for
the
highest
level
of
sunscreen
use
and
059
(95%
CI
=
036-097)
for
the
highest
level
of
wearing
of
clothes
while
in
the
sun
The
sun
protection
factor
had
no
effect
on
nevus
counts
despite
a
high
median
value
of
174
Sunburn
number
was
not
associated
with
nevus
count
The
highest
risk
associated
with
sunscreen
use
was
found
among
children
who
had
never
experienced
sunburn
In
white
European
children
sunscreen
use
appears
to
be
associated
with
development
of
nevi
probably
because
it
allows
longer
sun
exposures
Wearing
clothes
may
be
an
effective
way
to
prevent
proliferation
of
nevi
Since
a
high
nevus
count
is
a
strong
predictor
of
melanoma
sunscreen
use
may
be
involved
in
melanoma
occurrence
because
it
may
encourage
recreational
sun
exposure
