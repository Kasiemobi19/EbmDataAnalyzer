Self-measured
versus
ambulatory
blood
pressure
in
the
diagnosis
of
hypertension
Abstract
Text
We
examined
to
what
extent
self-measurement
of
blood
pressure
at
home
(HBP)
can
be
an
alternative
to
ambulatory
monitoring
(ABP)
to
diagnose
white-coat
hypertension
In
247
untreated
patients
we
compared
the
white-coat
effects
obtained
by
HBP
and
ABP
The
thresholds
to
diagnose
hypertension
were
>
or
=
140/>
or
=
90
mmHg
for
conventional
blood
pressure
(CBP)
and
>
or
=
135/>
or
=
85
mmHg
for
daytime
ABP
and
HBP
Mean
systolic/diastolic
CBP
HBP
and
ABP
were
1554/1000
1431/915
and
1481/950
mmHg
respectively
The
white-coat
effect
was
50/35
mmHg
larger
on
HBP
compared
with
ABP
(123/86
versus
72/50
mmHg
P
<
0001)
The
correlation
coefficients
between
the
white-coat
effects
based
on
HBP
and
ABP
were
074
systolic
and
060
diastolic
(P
<
0001)
With
ABP
as
a
reference
the
specificity
of
HBP
to
detect
white-coat
hypertension
was
886%
and
the
sensitivity
was
684%
Our
findings
are
in
line
with
the
recommendations
of
the
ASH
Ad
Hoc
Panel
that
recommends
HBP
for
screening
while
ABP
has
a
better
prognostic
accuracy
