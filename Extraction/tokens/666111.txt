Isoniazid-related
hepatitis
a
US
Public

cooperative
surveillance
study
Abstract
Text
After
an
outbreak
of
hepatitis
in
Washington
DC
in
1970
among
a
group
of
persons
taking
isoniazid
to
prevent
tuberculosis
an
isoniazid
surveillance
study
was
conducted
among
13838
persons
in
21
participating
health
departments
Age
appeared
to
be
the
predominant
factor
influencing
the
risk
of
developing
isoniazid-related
hepatitis
ie
increasing
age
was
associated
with
an
increasing
risk
Drinking
alcohol
especially
on
a
daily
basis
also
seemed
to
enhance
the
risk
of
hepatitis
among
persons
concurrently
taking
isoniazid
In
general
case
rates
among
males
and
females
of
the
same
race
and
rates
among
different
races
were
not
markedly
different
however
there
were
striking
differences
in
the
case
rates
among
males
of
different
races
The
incidence
of
hepatitis
varied
greatly
among
the
21
cities
but
was
not
unique
to
any
geographic
region
nor
was
it
related
to
a
specific
manufacturer
of
isoniazid
The
onset
in
most
cases
occurred
within
the
first
few
months
of
treatment
Eight
fatalities
were
reported
by
the
21
participating
health
departments
7
occurring
in
one
city
Black
females
accounted
for
5
of
the
8
deaths
This
information
provides
a
basis
for
weighing
the
benefits
of
isoniazid
in
preventing
tuberculosis
against
the
risk
of
its
causing
hepatitis
Close
monitoring
for
overt
signs
or
symptoms
of
hepatitis
among
persons
receiving
isoniazid
preventive
therapy
is
indicated
especially
for
persons
greater
than
or
equal
to
35
years
of
age
and
those
who
drink
alcoholic
beverages
on
a
daily
basis
