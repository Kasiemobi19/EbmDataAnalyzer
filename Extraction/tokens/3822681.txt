self-hypnosis

in

migraine
Abstract
Text
In
a
prospective
study
we
compared
propranolol
placebo
and
self-hypnosis
in
the
treatment
of
juvenile
classic
migraine
Children
aged
6
to
12
years
with
classic
migraine
who
had
no
previous
specific
treatment
were
randomized
into
propranolol
(at
3
mg/kg/d)
or
placebo
groups
for
a
3-month
period
and
then
crossed
over
for
3
months
After
this
6-month
period
each
child
was
taught
self-hypnosis
and
used
it
for
3
months
Twenty-eight
patients
completed
the
entire
study
The
mean
number
of
headaches
per
child
for
3
months
during
the
placebo
period
was
133
compared
with
149
during
the
propranolol
period
and
58
during
the
self-hypnosis
period
Statistical
analysis
showed
a
significant
association
between
decrease
in
headache
frequency
and
self-hypnosis
training
(P
=
045)
There
was
no
significant
change
in
subjective
or
objective
measures
of
headache
severity
with
either
therapy
