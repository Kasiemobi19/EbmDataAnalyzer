Title
Meta-analysis
of
the
effects
of
soy
protein
containing
isoflavones
on
the
lipid
profile
Abstract
Text
Convincing
evidence
shows
that
soy
protein
intake
has
beneficial
effects
on
lipid
changes
but
it
is
unclear
which
components
of
soy
protein
are
responsible
We
conducted
a
meta-analysis
to
identify
and
quantify
the
effects
of
soy
protein
containing
isoflavones
on
the
lipid
profile
Twenty-three
eligible
randomized
controlled
trials
published
from
1995
to
2002
were
identified
from
the
PUBMED
database
(National
Library
of
Medicine
Bethesda
MD)
Weighted
mean
effect
sizes
were
calculated
for
net
changes
in
serum
lipid
concentrations
by
using
fixed-effect
or
random-effect
models
Pre-specified
subgroup
analyses
were
performed
to
explore
the
influence
of
covariates
on
net
lipid
change
Soy
protein
with
isoflavones
intact
was
associated
with
significant
decreases
in
serum
total
cholesterol
(by
022
mmol/L
or
377%)
LDL
cholesterol
(by
021
mmol/L
or
525%)
and
triacylglycerols
(by
010
mmol/L
or
727%)
and
significant
increases
in
serum
HDL
cholesterol
(by
004
mmol/L
or
303%)
The
reductions
in
total
and
LDL
cholesterol
were
larger
in
men
than
in
women
Initial
total
cholesterol
concentrations
had
a
powerful
effect
on
changes
in
total
and
HDL
cholesterol
especially
in
subjects
with
hypercholesterolemia
Studies
with
intakes
>80
mg
showed
better
effects
on
the
lipid
profile
The
strongest
lowering
effects
of
soy
protein
containing
isoflavones
on
total
cholesterol
LDL
cholesterol
and
triacylglycerol
occurred
within
the
short
initial
period
of
intervention
whereas
improvements
in
HDL
cholesterol
were
only
observed
in
studies
of
>12
wk
duration
Tablets
containing
extracted
soy
isoflavones
did
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
total
cholesterol
reduction
Soy
protein
containing
isoflavones
significantly
reduced
serum
total
cholesterol
LDL
cholesterol
and
triacylglycerol
and
significantly
increased
HDL
cholesterol
but
the
changes
were
related
to
the
level
and
duration
of
intake
and
the
sex
and
initial
serum
lipid
concentrations
of
the
subjects
