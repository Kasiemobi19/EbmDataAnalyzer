Effect
of
carvedilol
on
survival
in
severe
chronic
heart
failure
Abstract
Text
Beta-blocking
agents
reduce
the
risk
of
hospitalization
and
death
in
patients
with
mild-to-moderate
heart
failure
but
little
is
known
about
their
effects
in
severe
heart
failure
We
evaluated
2289
patients
who
had
symptoms
of
heart
failure
at
rest
or
on
minimal
exertion
who
were
clinically
euvolemic
and
who
had
an
ejection
fraction
of
less
than
25
percent
In
a
double-blind
fashion
we
randomly
assigned
1133
patients
to
placebo
and
1156
patients
to
treatment
with
carvedilol
for
a
mean
period
of
104
months
during
which
standard
therapy
for
heart
failure
was
continued
Patients
who
required
intensive
care
had
marked
fluid
retention
or
were
receiving
intravenous
vasodilators
or
positive
inotropic
drugs
were
excluded
There
were
190
deaths
in
the
placebo
group
and
130
deaths
in
the
carvedilol
group
This
difference
reflected
a
35
percent
decrease
in
the
risk
of
death
with
carvedilol
(95
percent
confidence
interval
19
to
48
percent
P=000013
unadjusted
P=00014
adjusted
for
interim
analyses)
A
total
of
507
patients
died
or
were
hospitalized
in
the
placebo
group
as
compared
with
425
in
the
carvedilol
group
This
difference
reflected
a
24
percent
decrease
in
the
combined
risk
of
death
or
hospitalization
with
carvedilol
(95
percent
confidence
interval
13
to
33
percent
P<0001)
The
favorable
effects
on
both
end
points
were
seen
consistently
in
all
the
subgroups
we
examined
including
patients
with
a
history
of
recent
or
recurrent
cardiac
decompensation
Fewer
patients
in
the
carvedilol
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
withdrew
because
of
adverse
effects
or
for
other
reasons
(P=002)
The
previously
reported
benefits
of
carvedilol
with
regard
to
morbidity
and
mortality
in
patients
with
mild-to-moderate
heart
failure
were
also
apparent
in
the
patients
with
severe
heart
failure
who
were
evaluated
in
this
trial
