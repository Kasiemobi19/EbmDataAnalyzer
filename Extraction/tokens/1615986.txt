Title
Cervical
cytology
a
randomized
comparison
of
four
sampling
methods
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
compare
smear
quality
and
endocervical
cell
recovery
of
four
cervical
smear
sampling
devices
Two
thousand
fifteen
patients
undergoing
routine
cervical
smears
at
the
University
of
Tennessee
Obstetrics
and
Gynecology
clinics
were
randomly
assigned
to
a
cotton
swab-spatula
Cytobrush-spatula
Cervex-Brush
or
Bayne
Pap
Brush
The
cytopathology
laboratory
blind
to
method
used
specific
criteria
to
grade
smears
as
being
optimal
adequate
marginal
or
inadequate
Statistical
analysis
was
by
the
chi
2
and
analysis
of
variance
tests
No
statistical
differences
occurred
among
the
groups
for
nonpregnant
patients
For
pregnant
patients
smear
quality
was
improved
with
both
Cytobrush-spatula
and
Bayne
Pap
Brush
versus
cotton
swab-spatula
(p
=
00301
and
00004
respectively)
cotton
swab-spatula
had
fewer
endocervical
cells
than
the
Cytobrush-spatula
(p
=
00001)
Cervex-Brush
(p
=
00288)
and
Bayne
Pap
Brush
(p
=
00081)
The
cotton
swab-spatula
and
Cytobrush-spatula
appear
to
be
the
most
effective
screening
methods
for
nonpregnant
and
pregnant
patients
respectively
