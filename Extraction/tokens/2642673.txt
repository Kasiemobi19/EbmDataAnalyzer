Decision
rules
and
clinical
prediction
of
pneumonia
evaluation
of
low-yield
criteria
Abstract
Text
Prediction
rules
have
been
recommended
for
guiding
the
ordering
of
diagnostic
tests
Such
rules
can
be
used
to
define
low-yield
criteria
(LYC)
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
patients
with
an
extremely
low
probability
of
disease
and
hence
discouraging
test
ordering
by
the
physician
on
patients
meeting
LYC
In
this
study
community
hospital
emergency
department
populations
of
adults
(n
=
255)
and
children
(n
=
78)
were
evaluated
prospectively
for
the
presence
of
predictive
clinical
parameters
and
the
physician's
estimate
of
pneumonia
prior
to
obtaining
a
chest
film
We
developed
LYC
and
analyzed
published
LYC
for
obtaining
chest
films
on
patients
considered
at
risk
for
pneumonia
by
means
of
logistic
regression
receiver
operating
characteristics
curve
and
negative
predictive
value
analyses
We
were
unable
to
derive
or
validate
clinically
useful
LYC
to
improve
on
the
seasoned
clinician's
probability
estimate
of
pneumonia
We
discuss
the
inherent
limitations
in
the
development
and
application
of
LYC
that
must
be
understood
by
those
who
seek
to
limit
the
ordering
of
chest
films
by
the
application
of
guidelines
developed
from
decision
rules
