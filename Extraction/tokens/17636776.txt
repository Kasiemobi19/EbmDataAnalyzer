Title
Selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
for
depressive
disorders
in
children
and
adolescents
Abstract
Text
Depressive
disorders
are
common
in
young
people
and
are
associated
with
significant
negative
impacts
Selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
are
often
used
however
evidence
of
their
effectiveness
in
children
and
adolescents
is
not
clear
Furthermore
there
have
been
warnings
against
their
use
in
this
population
due
to
concerns
about
increased
risk
of
suicidal
ideation
and
behaviour
To
determine
the
efficacy
and
adverse
outcomes
including
definitive
suicidal
behaviour
and
suicidal
ideation
of
SSRIs
compared
to
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
depressive
disorders
in
children
and
adolescents
We
searched
the
CCDAN
Trials
Register
MEDLINE
PSYCHINFO
and
CENTRAL
Reference
lists
were
checked
letters
were
sent
to
key
researchers
and
internet
databases
searched
We
included
published
and
unpublished
randomised
controlled
trials
Two
or
three
review
authors
selected
the
trials
assessed
the
quality
and
extracted
trial
and
outcome
data
We
used
a
fixed-effect
meta-analysis
The
relative
risk
was
used
to
summarise
dichotomous
outcomes
and
the
mean
difference
to
summarise
continuous
measures
Twelve
trials
were
eligible
for
inclusion
with
ten
providing
usable
data
At
8-12
weeks
there
was
evidence
that
children
and
adolescents
'responded'
to
treatment
with
SSRIs
(RR
128
95%
CI
117
to
141)
There
was
also
evidence
of
an
increased
risk
of
suicidal
ideation
and
behaviour
for
those
prescribed
SSRIs
(RR
180
95%
CI
119
to
272)
Fluoxetine
was
the
only
SSRI
where
there
was
consistent
evidence
from
three
trials
that
it
was
effective
in
reducing
depression
symptoms
in
both
children
and
adolescents
(CDRS-R
treatment
effect
-563
95%
CI
-738
to
-388)
and
'response'
to
treatment
(RR
186
95%
CI
149
to
232)
Where
rates
of
adverse
events
were
reported
this
was
higher
for
those
prescribed
SSRIs
Caution
is
required
to
interpret
the
results
First
there
were
methodological
issues
including
high
attrition
issues
regarding
measurement
instruments
and
clinical
usefulness
of
outcomes
often
variously
defined
across
trials
Second
patients
seen
in
clinical
practice
are
likely
to
be
more
unwell
and
at
greater
risk
of
suicide
compared
to
those
in
the
trials
and
it
is
unclear
how
this
group
would
respond
to
SSRIs
This
needs
to
be
considered
along
with
the
evidence
of
an
increased
risk
of
suicide
related
outcomes
in
those
treated
with
SSRIs
It
is
unclear
what
the
effect
of
SSRIs
is
on
suicide
completion
While
untreated
depression
is
associated
with
the
risk
of
completed
suicide
and
impacts
on
functioning
it
is
unclear
whether
SSRIs
would
modify
this
risk
in
a
clinically
meaningful
way
