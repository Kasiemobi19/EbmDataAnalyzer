Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
use
of
low
molecular
weight
heparin
for
the
treatment
of
venous
thromboembolism
in
pregnancy
A
prospective
observational
study
The
maternity
units
in
two
university
teaching
hospitals
and
one
district
general
teaching
hospital
Thirty-six
consecutive
women
presenting
with
objectively
diagnosed
venous
thromboembolism
during
pregnancy
and
the
immediate
puerperium
Treatment
with
the
low
molecular
weight
heparin
enoxaparin
approximately
1
mg/kg
sc
twice
daily
based
on
early
pregnancy
weight
Peak
anti-Xa
activity
(three
hours
post-injection)
alterations
in
treatment
side
effects
and
the
use
of
regional
anaesthesia
In
33
women
the
initial
dose
of
enoxaparin
provided
satisfactory
peak
anti-Xa
activity
(median
08
u/mL
range
044-10
u/mL)
and
was
continued
Three
women
required
dose
reduction
since
peak
anti-Xa
activities
were
above
the
therapeutic
range
(12
12
and
11
u/mL)
No
woman
developed
thrombocytopaenia
haemorrhagic
complication
or
further
thromboembolic
episode
Two
women
developed
allergic
skin
reactions
on
enoxaparin
and
were
changed
to
tinzaparin
Fifteen
women
had
regional
anaesthesia
for
delivery
with
a
reduced
dose
of
enoxaparin
(40
mg
once
daily)
all
without
complication
Enoxaparin
is
a
safe
and
effective
treatment
for
venous
thromboembolism
during
pregnancy
and
confers
a
major
advantage
over
unfractionated
heparin
through
its
simplified
regimen
of
administration
