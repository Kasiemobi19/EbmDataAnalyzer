Use

enalapril
to

Abstract
Text
Angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
attenuate
the
decline
in
renal
function
in
diabetic
patients
with
microalbuminuria
However
no
data
are
available
on
the
use
of
ACE
inhibitors
to
prevent
the
decrease
in
renal
function
in
normotensive
normoalbuminuric
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
To
evaluate
the
effect
of
prolonged
ACE
inhibition
on
renal
function
and
albuminuria
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
Randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
with
6-year
follow-up
Eight
outpatient
clinics
coordinated
by
a
department
of
medicine
in
a
university
hospital
156
patients
in
whom
type
2
diabetes
was
diagnosed
after
40
years
of
age
who
had
a
baseline
mean
blood
pressure
less
than
107
mm
Hg
and
albuminuria
(albumin
excretion
<
or
=
30
mg/24
h)
Enalapril
10
mg/d
or
placebo
Degree
of
albuminuria
at
24
hours
creatinine
clearance
blood
pressure
and
hemoglobin
A1c
values
Enalapril
therapy
decreased
albumin
excretion
from
a
mean
+/-
SD
of
116
+/-
7
mg/24
h
to
97
+/-
6
mg/24
h
at
2
years
This
was
followed
by
a
gradual
increase
to
158
+/-
8
mg/24
h
at
6
years
In
the
placebo
group
albumin
excretion
increased
from
108
+/-
8
mg/24
h
to
265
+/-
10
mg/24
h
at
6
years
(P
=
0001
for
enalapril
compared
with
placebo)
Transition
to
microalbuminuria
occurred
in
15
of
79
(19%)
placebo
recipients
and
5
of
77
(65%)
enalapril
recipients
Enalapril
treatment
resulted
in
an
absolute
risk
reduction
of
125%
(95%
CI
2%
to
23%
P
=
0042)
for
development
of
microalbuminuria
After
6
years
creatinine
clearance
decreased
from
178
+/-
013
mL/s
to
163
+/-
012
mL/s
(mean
decrease
0025
mL/s
per
year)
in
enalapril
recipients
and
from
181
+/-
015
mL/s
to
157
+/-
017
mL/s
(mean
decrease
004
mL/s
per
year)
in
placebo
recipients
(P
=
0040)
Hemoglobin
A1c
values
decreased
modestly
in
both
groups
Mean
blood
pressure
remained
normal
(<
107
mm
Hg)
in
all
patients
Enalapril
attenuated
the
decline
in
renal
function
and
reduced
the
extent
of
albuminuria
in
normotensive
normoalbuminuric
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
Further
research
is
needed
to
determine
whether
this
treatment
forestalls
the
development
of
overt
nephropathy
