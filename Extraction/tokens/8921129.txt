Bereavement
grieving
and
psychological
morbidity
after
first
trimester
spontaneous

comparing
expectant

with
surgical
evacuation
Abstract
Text
Early
pregnancy
loss
is
a
profound
adverse
life
event
for
many
women
and
increased
psychiatric
morbidity
has
been
shown
to
occur
after
spontaneous
abortion
Dilatation
and
curettage
(D&C)
has
been
the
cornerstone
in
the
treatment
of
first
trimester
spontaneous
abortion
over
the
last
few
decades
During
recent
years
the
possibility
of
conservative
management
has
however
been
increasingly
discussed
In
a
prospective
randomized
trial
we
compared
psychological
reactions
and
morbidity
after
either
expectant
management
or
D&C
for
miscarriages
of
<
13
weeks
gestation
in
which
a
transvaginal
ultrasound
examination
showed
intrauterine
tissue
and/or
blood
clots
with
an
antero-posterior
diameter
of
between
15
and
50
mm
Of
the
86
patients
included
58
were
randomized
to
expectant
management
and
28
to
primary
D&C
In
patients
randomized
to
expectant
management
pregnancy
products
shown
by
transvaginal
ultrasound
disappeared
within
3
days
in
43
cases
(74%)
whereas
15
patients
(26%)
underwent
D&C
owing
to
retained
products
of
conception
after
3
days
At
2
weeks
after
inclusion
all
patients
answered
self-administered
questionnaires
including
visual
analogue
scales
concerning
their
experience
of
the
pregnancy
loss
the
present
situation
and
concerns
about
the
future
A
brief
anxiety
status
inventory
was
included
This
study
showed
no
increase
in
anxiety
or
depressive
reactions
2
weeks
after
a
first
trimester
spontaneous
abortion
when
these
patients
were
compared
with
non-pregnant
healthy
working
females
19-39
years
of
age
Moreover
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
psychological
reactions
between
patients
managed
either
expectantly
or
by
D&C
