Abstract
Text
A
total
of
28
000
persons
with
fibrotic
pulmonary
lesions
compatible
with
tuberculosis
were
followed
for
five
years
after
receiving
12
24
or
52
weeks
of
preventive
treatment
with
isoniazid
or
placeboCompared
with
placebo
12
weeks
of
isoniazid
eliminated
less
than
one-third
and
24
weeks
eliminated
two-thirds
of
the
tuberculosis
risk
Where
preventive
treatment
is
not
currently
practised
adopting
a
24-week
regimen
could
decrease
the
incidence
of
tuberculosis
in
such
populations
by
65%Hepatitis
the
only
serious
side-effect
encountered
occurred
infrequently
but
was
more
common
among
isoniazid
recipients
(05%)
than
among
placebo
recipients
(01%)Fifty-two
weeks
of
isoniazid
prevented
the
most
tuberculosis
but
24
weeks
prevented
more
tuberculosis
cases
per
case
of
hepatitis
caused
Where
preventive
treatment
is
currently
practised
for
52
weeks
adopting
a
24-week
regimen
would
decrease
hepatitis
by
one-third
and
increase
tuberculosis
by
40%
