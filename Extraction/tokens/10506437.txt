Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
2
modern
hematology
analyzers
in
flagging
heterophile-positive
patients
to
determine
if
heterophile-positive
instrument-flagged
specimens
contain
a
larger
number
or
a
different
spectrum
of
atypical
lymphocytes
to
document
the
overall
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
Hoagland's
morphologic
criteria
in
identifying
heterophile-positive
patients
in
an
outpatient
population
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
mononucleosis
and
to
examine
whether
individual
morphologic
features
might
aid
in
the
diagnosis
of
suspected
infectious
mononucleosis
A
prospective
study
of
patients
referred
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
infectious
mononucleosis
who
subsequently
tested
positive
for
the
heterophile
antibody
The
control
group
consisted
of
a
similar
population
of
patients
who
tested
negative
for
the
heterophile
antibody
Hematology
profiles
of
peripheral
blood
samples
were
determined
with
Coulter
STKS
and
Sysmex
NE-8000
analyzers
A
corresponding
Wright-Giemsa-stained
blood
smear
was
subsequently
examined
by
a
single
skilled
technologist
who
performed
a
200-cell
white
blood
cell
differential
and
a
200-cell
lymphocyte
differential
A
specific
morphologic
search
was
made
for
the
presence
of
smudge
cells
or
lymphocytes
with
cloverleaf
nuclei
Using
a
combination
of
all
flagging
criteria
the
2
analyzers
identified
156
(862%)
of
181
heterophile-positive
patients
as
meriting
further
review
The
sensitivity
and
specificity
values
of
the
Coulter
analyzer
in
predicting
positive
heterophile
status
for
the
blast
flag
were
41%
and
971%
respectively
for
the
variant
lymphocyte
flags
724%
and
791%
respectively
and
for
both
flags
40%
and
981%
respectively
For
the
Sysmex
analyzer
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
values
in
predicting
positive
heterophile
status
for
the
blast
flag
were
434%
and
886%
respectively
for
the
variant
lymphocyte
flag
158%
and
908%
respectively
and
for
both
flags
105%
and
96%
respectively
Considering
the
classic
criteria
developed
by
Hoagland
a
lymphocytosis
of
at
least
50%
was
present
in
120
(663%)
heterophile-positive
patients
while
an
atypical
lymphocytosis
of
at
least
10%
of
the
total
WBC
count
was
noted
in
135
patients
(746%)
The
sensitivity
and
specificity
values
of
a
lymphocytosis
>
or
=50%
for
diagnosing
heterophile-positive
status
were
663%
and
845%
respectively
while
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
an
atypical
lymphocytosis
>
or
=10%
were
746%
and
923%
respectively
The
presence
of
smudge
cells
or
cloverleaf
lymphocyte
nuclei
was
verified
as
having
high
specificity
but
low
sensitivity
for
suggesting
a
diagnosis
of
infectious
mononucleosis
Although
a
number
of
patients
did
not
meet
Hoagland's
criteria
for
the
diagnosis
of
infectious
mononucleosis
the
flagging
systems
of
modern
hematology
analyzers
successfully
identified
most
cases
as
requiring
further
review
