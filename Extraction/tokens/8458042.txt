Multicenter
double-blind
controlled
comparison
of
zolpidem
and
triazolam
in
elderly
patients
with
insomnia
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
and
safety
of
zolpidem
a
hypnotic
of
a
new
chemical
class
(the
imidazopyridines)
was
compared
with
a
reference
benzodiazepine
in
elderly
insomniac
patients
in
a
randomized
double-blind
multicenter
trial
Hospitalized
patients
aged
58
to
98
years
were
randomized
to
receive
zolpidem
5
mg
(70
patients)
zolpidem
10
mg
(74
patients)
or
triazolam
025
mg
(77
patients)
at
bed-time
(Three
patients
were
excluded
and
13
patients
did
not
complete
the
study)
The
3-week
active
treatment
period
was
preceded
by
3
and
followed
by
7
days
of
placebo
administration
Sleep
quality
was
assessed
by
the
patient
via
a
questionnaire
and
visual
analog
scale
A
clinician's
global
impression
was
also
recorded
All
measures
of
sleep
quality
were
improved
by
both
doses
of
zolpidem
and
by
triazolam
The
improvements
between
the
end
of
the
placebo
phase
and
the
end
of
the
active
treatment
phase
were
significant
for
all
treatments
and
assessment
instruments
Moreover
the
significant
improvements
in
all
measures
were
maintained
during
the
week
following
withdrawal
of
both
doses
of
zolpidem
The
improvement
in
most
sleep
assessment
parameters
was
maintained
after
withdrawal
of
triazolam
Tolerability
of
all
treatments
was
excellent
The
majority
of
patients
reported
no
adverse
effects
The
reported
adverse
effects
in
all
groups
included
nightmares
daytime
drowsiness
and
day-
or
nighttime
agitation
There
was
no
evidence
of
rebound
insomnia
the
therapeutic
effect
of
zolpidem
outlasted
drug
treatment
There
were
no
signs
of
agitation
or
anxiety
following
cessation
of
treatment
which
might
be
indicative
of
withdrawal
phenomena
Confusion
was
recorded
only
in
the
triazolam
group
These
results
suggest
that
zolpidem
is
at
least
as
effective
as
triazolam
in
geriatric
insomniac
patients
Zolpidem
5
mg
and
10
mg
demonstrated
a
good
safety
profile
On
the
basis
of
these
data
zolpidem
5
mg
should
be
given
as
a
starting
dose
in
elderly
patients
with
a
possible
increase
up
to
10
mg
in
more
severe
cases
of
insomnia
