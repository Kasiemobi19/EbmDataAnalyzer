A
randomized
controlled
open-label
trial
of
a
single
day
of
mebendazole
versus
a
single
dose
of
tinidazole
in
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
in
children
Abstract
Text
Giardia
duodenalis
is
the
most
commonly
detected
parasite
in
the
intestinal
tract
of
humans
and
5-nitroimidazole
compounds
quinacrine
and
furazolidone
have
been
used
against
giardiasis
However
cases
refractory
to
treatment
with
these
drugs
are
becoming
more
common
worldwide
To
compare
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
mebendazole
versus
tinidazole
in
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
122
children
(aged
5
to
15
years)
of
both
sexes
with
confirmed
Giardia
duodenalis
cysts
or
trophozoites
in
their
stool
samples
were
randomly
separated
into
two
groups
of
61
individuals
Each
group
received
either
mebendazole
200
mg
three
times
for
1
day
or
tinidazole
50
mg/kg
in
a
single
dose
The
evaluation
of
the
efficacy
was
based
on
parasitological
response
Parents
or
legal
guardians
of
each
child
were
asked
to
provide
three
fecal
samples
on
days
3
5
and
7
after
treatment
completion
A
child
was
considered
to
be
cured
if
no
Giardia
trophozoites
or
cysts
were
found
in
any
of
the
three
post-treatment
fecal
specimens
evaluated
by
direct
wet
mounts
and/or
after
Ritchie
concentration
techniques
The
frequency
of
cure
was
higher
for
tinidazole
(8197%)
than
for
mebendazole
(6393%)
the
difference
was
statistically
significant
(p
<
005)
Transient
abdominal
pain
was
more
common
in
children
treated
with
mebendazole
(p
<
005)
whereas
loss
of
appetite
bitter
taste
headache
vomiting
and
nausea
were
more
common
in
the
tinidazole-treated
group
(p
<
005)
Three
doses
of
mebendazole
in
a
single
day
are
inferior
to
a
single
dose
tinidazole
in
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
