Male
circumcision
penile
human
papillomavirus
infection
and
cervical
cancer
in
female
partners
Abstract
Text
It
is
uncertain
whether
male
circumcision
reduces
the
risks
of
penile
human
papillomavirus
(HPV)
infection
in
the
man
and
of
cervical
cancer
in
his
female
partner
We
pooled
data
on
1913
couples
enrolled
in
one
of
seven
case-control
studies
of
cervical
carcinoma
in
situ
and
cervical
cancer
in
five
countries
Circumcision
status
was
self-reported
and
the
accuracy
of
the
data
was
confirmed
by
physical
examination
at
three
study
sites
The
presence
or
absence
of
penile
HPV
DNA
was
assessed
by
a
polymerase-chain-reaction
assay
in
1520
men
and
yielded
a
valid
result
in
the
case
of
1139
men
(749
percent)
Penile
HPV
was
detected
in
166
of
the
847
uncircumcised
men
(196
percent)
and
in
16
of
the
292
circumcised
men
(55
percent)
After
adjustment
for
age
at
first
intercourse
lifetime
number
of
sexual
partners
and
other
potential
confounders
circumcised
men
were
less
likely
than
uncircumcised
men
to
have
HPV
infection
(odds
ratio
037
95
percent
confidence
interval
016
to
085)
Monogamous
women
whose
male
partners
had
six
or
more
sexual
partners
and
were
circumcised
had
a
lower
risk
of
cervical
cancer
than
women
whose
partners
were
uncircumcised
(adjusted
odds
ratio
042
95
percent
confidence
interval
023
to
079)
Results
were
similar
in
the
subgroup
of
men
in
whom
circumcision
was
confirmed
by
medical
examination
Male
circumcision
is
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
penile
HPV
infection
and
in
the
case
of
men
with
a
history
of
multiple
sexual
partners
a
reduced
risk
of
cervical
cancer
in
their
current
female
partners
