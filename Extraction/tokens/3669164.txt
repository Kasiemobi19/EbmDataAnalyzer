Title
The
evaluation
of
microscopic
hematuria
a
population-based
study
Abstract
Text
From
1979
until
1983
2005
men
underwent
routine
urological
examinations
Of
these
men
85
(4
per
cent)
had
asymptomatic
microscopic
hematuria
All
men
underwent
complete
urological
evaluation
Significant
urological
disease
was
detected
in
22
per
cent
of
the
patients
Therefore
complete
urological
evaluation
can
be
justified
in
a
nonselected
group
of
men
with
microscopic
hematuria
