Comparison
of
low-intensity
warfarin
therapy
with
conventional-intensity
warfarin
therapy
for
long-term
prevention
of
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
Abstract
Text
Warfarin
is
very
effective
in
preventing
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
but
is
also
associated
with
a
substantial
risk
of
bleeding
After
three
months
of
conventional
warfarin
therapy
a
lower
dose
of
anticoagulant
medication
may
result
in
less
bleeding
and
still
prevent
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
We
conducted
a
randomized
double-blind
study
in
which
738
patients
who
had
completed
three
or
more
months
of
warfarin
therapy
for
unprovoked
venous
thromboembolism
were
randomly
assigned
to
continue
warfarin
therapy
with
a
target
international
normalized
ratio
(INR)
of
20
to
30
(conventional
intensity)
or
a
target
INR
of
15
to
19
(low
intensity)
Patients
were
followed
for
an
average
of
24
years
Of
369
patients
assigned
to
low-intensity
therapy
16
had
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
(19
per
100
person-years)
as
compared
with
6
of
369
assigned
to
conventional-intensity
therapy
(07
per
100
person-years
hazard
ratio
28
95
percent
confidence
interval
11
to
70)
A
major
bleeding
episode
occurred
in
nine
patients
assigned
to
low-intensity
therapy
(11
events
per
100
person-years)
and
eight
patients
assigned
to
conventional-intensity
therapy
(09
event
per
100
person-years
hazard
ratio
12
95
percent
confidence
interval
04
to
30)
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
frequency
of
overall
bleeding
between
the
two
groups
(hazard
ratio
13
95
percent
confidence
interval
08
to
21)
Conventional-intensity
warfarin
therapy
is
more
effective
than
low-intensity
warfarin
therapy
for
the
long-term
prevention
of
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
The
low-intensity
warfarin
regimen
does
not
reduce
the
risk
of
clinically
important
bleeding
