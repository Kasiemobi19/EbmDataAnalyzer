Abstract
Text
Nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
is
common
among
the
elderly
and
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
stroke
We
investigated
whether
anticoagulation
with
warfarin
would
reduce
this
risk
We
conducted
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
to
evaluate
low-intensity
anticoagulation
with
warfarin
(prothrombin-time
ratio
12
to
15)
in
571
men
with
chronic
nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
525
patients
had
not
previously
had
a
cerebral
infarction
whereas
46
patients
had
previously
had
such
an
event
The
primary
end
point
was
cerebral
infarction
secondary
end
points
were
cerebral
hemorrhage
and
death
Among
the
patients
with
no
history
of
stroke
cerebral
infarction
occurred
in
19
of
the
265
patients
in
the
placebo
group
during
an
average
follow-up
of
17
years
(43
percent
per
year)
and
in
4
of
the
260
patients
in
the
warfarin
group
during
an
average
follow-up
of
18
years
(09
percent
per
year)
The
reduction
in
risk
with
warfarin
therapy
was
079
(95
percent
confidence
interval
052
to
090
P
=
0001)
The
annual
event
rate
among
the
228
patients
over
70
years
of
age
was
48
percent
in
the
placebo
group
and
09
percent
in
the
warfarin
group
(risk
reduction
079
P
=
002)
The
only
cerebral
hemorrhage
occurred
in
a
73-year-old
patient
in
the
warfarin
group
Other
major
hemorrhages
all
gastrointestinal
occurred
in
10
patients
4
in
the
placebo
group
for
a
rate
of
09
percent
per
year
and
6
in
the
warfarin
group
for
a
rate
of
13
percent
per
year
There
were
37
deaths
that
were
not
preceded
by
a
cerebral
end
point--22
in
the
placebo
group
and
15
in
the
warfarin
group
(risk
reduction
031
P
=
019)
Cerebral
infarction
was
more
common
among
patients
with
a
history
of
cerebral
infarction
(93
percent
per
year
in
the
placebo
group
and
61
percent
per
year
in
the
warfarin
group)
than
among
those
without
such
a
history
Low-intensity
anticoagulation
with
warfarin
prevented
cerebral
infarction
in
patients
with
nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
without
producing
an
excess
risk
of
major
hemorrhage
This
benefit
extended
to
patients
over
70
years
of
age
