Diuretic
use
progressive

in
patients

(SOLVD)
Abstract
Text
We
sought
to
determine
whether
non-potassium-sparing
diuretics
(PSDs)
in
the
absence
of
a
PSD
may
result
in
progressive
heart
failure
(HF)
Angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
incompletely
suppress
ACE
activity
in
HF
patients
Furthermore
non-PSDs
are
activators
of
aldosterone
secretion
We
reasoned
that
non-PSDs
in
the
absence
of
a
PSD
might
result
in
progressive
HF
In
the
6797
patients
in
the
Studies
Of
Left
Ventricular
Dysfunction
(SOLVD)
we
compared
the
risk
of
hospitalization
for
or
death
from
HF
between
those
taking
a
PSD
and
those
who
were
not
adjusting
for
known
covariates
The
risk
of
hospitalization
from
worsening
HF
in
those
taking
a
PSD
relative
to
those
taking
only
a
non-PSD
was
074
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
055
to
099
p
=
0047)
The
relative
risk
for
cardiovascular
death
was
074
(95%
CI
059
to
093
p
=
0011)
for
death
from
all
causes
073
(95%
CI
059
to
090
p
=
0004)
and
for
hospitalization
for
or
death
from
HF
075
(95%
CI
058
to
097
p
=
0030)
Compared
with
patients
not
taking
any
diuretic
the
risk
of
hospitalization
or
death
due
to
worsening
HF
in
patients
taking
non-PSDs
alone
was
significantly
increased
(risk
ratio
[RR]
=
131
95%
CI
109
to
157
p
=
00004)
this
was
not
observed
in
patients
taking
PSDs
with
or
without
a
non-PSD
(RR
=
099
95%
CI
076
to
130
p
=
095)
The
use
of
PSDs
in
HF
patients
is
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
death
from
or
hospitalization
for
progressive
HF
or
all-cause
or
cardiovascular
death
compared
with
patients
taking
only
a
non-PSD
