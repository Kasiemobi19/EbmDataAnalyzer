Abstract
Text
To
establish
strategies
for
treatment
of
asymptomatic
microscopic
hematuria
we
conducted
a
prospective
study
of
1034
patients
with
this
disease
The
patients
were
examined
by
cystoscopy
urine
cytology
abdominal
ultrasound
and
excretory
urography
On
initial
examination
30
highly
significant
lesions
including
24
cases
of
urological
malignancies
195
moderately
significant
lesions
and
246
insignificant
lesions
were
detected
In
the
remaining
563
patients
no
underlying
lesion
could
be
found
Of
the
246
patients
with
insignificant
lesions
and
563
with
unexplained
asymptomatic
microscopic
hematuria
followup
was
done
in
421
at
6-month
intervals
for
more
than
1
year
A
diagnosis
became
clear
within
3
years
in
22
patients
including
3
cases
of
bladder
carcinoma
and
1
of
prostatic
carcinoma
