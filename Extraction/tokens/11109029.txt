Screening
for
hypercholesterolaemia
versus
case
finding
for
familial
hypercholesterolaemia
a
systematic
review
and
cost-effectiveness
analysis
Abstract
Text
In
the
majority
of
people
with
familial
hypercholesterolaemia
(FH)
the
disorder
is
caused
by
a
mutation
of
the
low-density
lipoprotein
receptor
gene
that
impairs
its
proper
function
resulting
in
very
high
levels
of
plasma
cholesterol
Such
levels
result
in
early
and
severe
atherosclerosis
and
hence
substantial
excess
mortality
from
coronary
heart
disease
Most
people
with
FH
are
undiagnosed
or
only
diagnosed
after
their
first
coronary
event
but
early
detection
and
treatment
with
hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme
(HMG
CoA)
reductase
inhibitors
(statins)
can
reduce
morbidity
and
mortality
The
prevalence
of
FH
in
the
UK
population
is
estimated
to
be
1
in
500
which
means
that
approximately
110000
people
are
affected
To
evaluate
whether
screening
for
FH
is
appropriate
To
determine
which
system
of
screening
is
most
acceptable
and
cost-effective
To
assess
the
deleterious
psychosocial
effects
of
genetic
and
clinical
screening
for
an
asymptomatic
treatable
inherited
condition
To
assess
whether
the
risks
of
screening
outweigh
potential
benefits
Relevant
papers
were
identified
through
a
search
of
the
electronic
databases
Additional
papers
referenced
in
the
search
material
were
identified
and
collected
Known
researchers
in
the
field
were
contacted
and
asked
to
supply
information
on
unpublished
or
ongoing
studies
INCLUSION/EXCLUSION
CRITERIA
SCREENING
AND
TREATMENT
The
review
included
studies
of
the
mortality
and
morbidity
associated
with
FH
the
effectiveness
and
cost
of
treatment
(ignoring
pre-statin
therapies
in
adults)
and
of
the
effectiveness
or
cost
of
possible
screening
strategies
for
FH
PSYCHOSOCIAL
EFFECTS
OF
SCREENING
The
search
for
papers
on
the
psychological
and
social
effects
of
screening
for
a
treatable
inherited
condition
was
limited
to
the
last
5
years
because
recent
developments
in
genetic
testing
have
changed
the
nature
and
implications
of
such
screening
tests
Papers
focusing
on
genetic
testing
for
FH
and
breast
cancer
were
included
Papers
relating
to
the
risk
of
coronary
heart
disease
with
similarly
modifiable
outcome
(non-FH)
were
also
included
DATA
EXTRACTION
AND
ASSESSMENT
OF
VALIDITY
A
data
assessment
tool
was
designed
to
assess
the
quality
and
validity
of
the
papers
which
reported
primary
data
for
the
social
and
psychological
effects
of
screening
Available
guidelines
for
systematically
reviewing
papers
concentrated
on
quantitative
methods
and
were
of
limited
relevance
An
algorithm
was
developed
which
could
be
used
for
both
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
literature
MODELLING
METHODS
A
model
was
constructed
to
investigate
the
relative
cost
and
effectiveness
of
various
forms
of
population
screening
(universal
or
opportunistic)
and
case-finding
screening
(screening
relatives
of
known
FH
cases)
All
strategies
involved
a
two-stage
process
first
identifying
those
people
with
cholesterol
levels
sufficiently
elevated
to
be
compatible
with
a
diagnosis
of
FH
and
then
either
making
the
diagnosis
based
on
clinical
signs
and
a
family
history
of
coronary
disease
or
carrying
out
genetic
tests
Cost-effectiveness
has
been
measured
in
terms
of
incremental
cost
per
year
of
life
gained
MODELLING
COST-EFFECTIVENESS
FH
is
a
life-threatening
condition
with
a
long
presymptomatic
state
Diagnostic
tests
are
reasonably
reliable
and
acceptable
and
treatment
with
statins
substantially
improves
prognosis
Therefore
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
systematic
screening
for
this
condition
Case
finding
amongst
relatives
of
FH
cases
was
the
most
cost-effective
strategy
and
universal
systematic
screening
the
least
cost-effective
However
when
targeted
at
young
people
(16
year
olds)
universal
screening
was
also
cost-effective
Screening
patients
admitted
to
hospital
with
premature
myocardial
infarction
was
also
relatively
cost-effective
Screening
is
least
cost-effective
in
men
aged
over
35
years
because
the
gains
in
life
expectancy
are
small
