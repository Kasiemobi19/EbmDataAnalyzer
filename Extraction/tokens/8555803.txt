Abstract
Text
To
compare
effectiveness
of
levodopa
and
levodopa
combined
with
selegiline
in
treating
early
mild
Parkinson's
disease
Open
long
term
prospective
randomised
trial
93
hospitals
throughout
United
Kingdom
520
patients
with
early
Parkinson's
disease
who
were
not
receiving
dopaminergic
treatment
Treatment
with
levodopa
and
dopa
decarboxylase
inhibitor
(arm
1)
or
levodopa
and
decarboxylase
inhibitor
in
combination
with
selegiline
(arm
2)
Assessments
of
serial
disability
frequency
and
severity
of
adverse
events
and
deaths
from
all
causes
After
average
of
5-6
years'
follow
up
mortality
ratio
in
arm
2
compared
with
arm
1
was
157
(95%
confidence
interval
109
to
230)
and
difference
in
survival
between
the
two
arms
was
significant
(log
rank
test
P
=
0015)
Hazard
ratio
adjusted
for
age
and
sex
was
149
(102
to
216)
and
after
adjustment
for
other
baseline
factors
it
increased
to
157
(107
to
231)
Patients
in
arm
1
had
slightly
worse
disability
scores
than
those
in
arm
2
but
differences
were
not
significant
Functionally
disabling
peak
dose
dyskinesias
and
on/off
fluctuations
were
more
frequent
in
arm
2
than
arm
1
During
the
trial
the
dose
of
levodopa
required
to
produce
optimum
motor
control
steadily
increased
in
arm
1
(median
daily
dose
375
mg
at
1
year
and
625
mg
at
4
years)
but
median
dose
in
arm
2
did
not
change
(375
mg)
Levodopa
in
combination
with
selegiline
seemed
to
confer
no
clinical
benefit
over
levodopa
alone
in
treating
early
mild
Parkinson's
disease
Moreover
mortality
was
significantly
higher
with
combination
treatment
casting
doubts
on
its
chronic
use
in
Parkinson's
disease
