Evening
primrose
oil
and
treatment
of
premenstrual
syndrome
Abstract
Text
The
therapeutic
effectiveness
of
evening
primrose
oil
(Efamol
Vita-Glow)
in
the
relief
of
10
symptoms
associated
with
premenstrual
syndrome
(PMS)
as
well
as
menstrual
symptoms
was
studied
in
38
women
The
prospective
trial
was
randomised
double-blind
and
placebo-controlled
and
was
crossed-over
after
three
cycles
Although
the
results
showed
an
improvement
in
symptoms
of
PMS
during
the
trial
no
significant
differences
in
the
scoring
between
the
active
and
placebo
groups
were
found
over
six
cycles
No
"carry-over"
effect
of
active
medication
was
observed
the
beneficial
effect
on
all
symptoms
(psychological
fluid
retention
breast)
was
rapid
the
scores
decreasing
in
the
first
cycle
but
increasing
slightly
at
the
change-over
period
after
the
third
cycle
irrespective
of
whether
the
active
or
placebo
medication
was
next
given
These
findings
indicate
that
the
improvement
experienced
by
these
women
with
moderate
PMS
was
solely
a
placebo
effect
