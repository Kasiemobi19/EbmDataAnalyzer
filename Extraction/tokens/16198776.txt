Pulse
versus
continuous
terbinafine
for
onychomycosis
a
randomized
double-blind
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Effective
treatments
for
onychomycosis
are
expensive
Previous
studies
suggest
that
less
costly
pulsed
doses
of
antifungal
medications
may
be
as
effective
as
standard
continuous
doses
Terbinafine
is
the
current
treatment
of
choice
for
toenail
onychomycosis
Our
purpose
was
to
determine
whether
pulse-dose
terbinafine
is
as
effective
as
standard
continuous-dose
terbinafine
for
treatment
of
toenail
onychomycosis
We
conducted
a
double-blind
randomized
noninferiority
clinical
intervention
trial
in
the
Minneapolis
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Center
The
main
inclusion
criteria
for
participants
were
a
positive
dermatophyte
culture
and
at
least
25%
distal
subungual
clinical
involvement
Six
hundred
eighteen
volunteers
were
screened
306
were
randomized
Terbinafine
250
mg
daily
for
3
months
(continuous)
or
terbinafine
500
mg
daily
for
1
week
per
month
for
3
months
(pulse)
was
administered
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
mycological
cure
of
the
target
toenail
at
18
months
Secondary
outcome
measures
included
clinical
cure
and
complete
(clinical
plus
mycological)
cure
of
the
target
toenail
and
complete
cure
of
all
10
toenails
Results
of
an
intent-to-treat
analysis
did
not
meet
the
prespecified
criterion
for
noninferiority
but
did
demonstrate
the
superiority
of
continuous-dose
terbinafine
for
mycological
cure
of
the
target
toenail
(709%
[105/148]
vs
587%

and

toenails
(252%

vs
147%
[21/143]
P

RR

[95%

Tolerability
of
the
regimens
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
groups
(chi2
=163
P
=65)
The
study
population
primarily
consisted
of
older
men
with
severe
onychomycosis
This
study
demonstrated
the
superiority
of
continuous-
over
pulse-dose
terbinafine
We
also
found
this
expensive
therapy
to
be
much
less
effective
than
previously
believed
particularly
for
achieving
complete
cure
of
all
10
toenails
