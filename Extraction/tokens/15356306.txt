Oral
erythromycin
and
the
risk
of
sudden
death
from
cardiac
causes
Abstract
Text
Oral
erythromycin
prolongs
cardiac
repolarization
and
is
associated
with
case
reports
of
torsades
de
pointes
Because
erythromycin
is
extensively
metabolized
by
cytochrome
P-450
3A
(CYP3A)
isozymes
commonly
used
medications
that
inhibit
the
effects
of
CYP3A
may
increase
plasma
erythromycin
concentrations
thereby
increasing
the
risk
of
ventricular
arrhythmias
and
sudden
death
We
studied
the
association
between
the
use
of
erythromycin
and
the
risk
of
sudden
death
from
cardiac
causes
and
whether
this
risk
was
increased
with
the
concurrent
use
of
strong
inhibitors
of
CYP3A
We
studied
a
previously
identified
Tennessee
Medicaid
cohort
that
included
1249943
person-years
of
follow-up
and
1476
cases
of
confirmed
sudden
death
from
cardiac
causes
The
CYP3A
inhibitors
used
in
the
study
were
nitroimidazole
antifungal
agents
diltiazem
verapamil
and
troleandomycin
each
doubles
at
least
the
area
under
the
time-concentration
curve
for
a
CYP3A
substrate
Amoxicillin
an
antimicrobial
agent
with
similar
indications
but
which
does
not
prolong
cardiac
repolarization
and
former
use
of
erythromycin
also
were
studied
to
assess
possible
confounding
by
indication
The
multivariate
adjusted
rate
of
sudden
death
from
cardiac
causes
among
patients
currently
using
erythromycin
was
twice
as
high
(incidence-rate
ratio
201
95
percent
confidence
interval
108
to
375
P=003)
as
that
among
those
who
had
not
used
any
of
the
study
antibiotic
medications
There
was
no
significant
increase
in
the
risk
of
sudden
death
among
former
users
of
erythromycin
(incidence-rate
ratio
089
95
percent
confidence
interval
072
to
109
P=026)
or
among
those
who
were
currently
using
amoxicillin
(incidence-rate
ratio
118
95
percent
confidence
interval
059
to
236
P=065)
The
adjusted
rate
of
sudden
death
from
cardiac
causes
was
five
times
as
high
(incidence-rate
ratio
535
95
percent
confidence
interval
172
to
1664
P=0004)
among
those
who
concurrently
used
CYP3A
inhibitors
and
erythromycin
as
that
among
those
who
had
used
neither
CYP3A
inhibitors
nor
any
of
the
study
antibiotic
medications
In
contrast
there
was
no
increase
in
the
risk
of
sudden
death
among
those
who
concurrently
used
amoxicillin
and
CYP3A
inhibitors
or
those
currently
using
any
of
the
study
antibiotic
medications
who
had
formerly
used
CYP3A
inhibitors
The
concurrent
use
of
erythromycin
and
strong
inhibitors
of
CYP3A
should
be
avoided
