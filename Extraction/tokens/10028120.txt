Abstract
Text
An
increasing
number
of
revision
ACL
reconstructions
are
being
performed
each
year
Revision
ACL
surgery
is
challenging
and
cannot
be
approached
in
the
same
manner
as
primary
ACL
surgery
Successful
revision
ACL
surgery
requires
a
detailed
history
a
comprehensive
physical
examination
appropriate
radiologic
studies
and
careful
preoperative
planning
The
results
of
revision
ACL
surgery
do
not
equal
the
results
of
primary
ACL
surgery
and
this
should
be
explained
to
the
patient
prior
to
surgery
In
order
to
avoid
repeating
errors
that
led
to
failure
of
the
primary
reconstruction
the
etiology
of
the
primary
failure
must
be
clearly
understood
before
proceeding
with
the
revision
procedure
Although
graft
failure
is
the
most
common
reason
for
failure
of
the
original
reconstruction
and
revision
surgery
other
non-graft-related
problems
such
as
loss
of
motion
extensor
mechanism
dysfunction
and
degenerative
arthritis
can
also
result
in
an
unsatisfactory
outcome
and
residual
complaints
Errors
in
surgical
technique
specifically
nonanatomic
graft
placement
and
failure
to
address
associated
ligamentous
injuries
at
the
time
of
the
original
procedure
are
responsible
for
graft
failures
in
most
reported
series
Preoperative
planning
must
address
the
issues
of
graft
selection
skin
incisions
hardware
removal
tunnel
placement
graft
fixation
and
associated
ligamentous
injuries
Loss
of
motion
and
in
some
cases
enlarged
bone
tunnels
may
require
a
staged
approach
Because
of
the
weaker
initial
graft
fixation
laxity
of
secondary
restraints
the
potential
need
to
address
associated
ligamentous
injuries
and
the
presence
of
more
significant
articular
cartilage
changes
an
accelerated
rehabilitation
program
is
inappropriate
in
most
revision
cases
Successful
revision
ACL
surgery
requires
a
motivated
and
compliant
patient
a
well
thought
out
plan
and
an
experienced
surgeon
who
is
knowledgeable
and
proficient
with
a
variety
of
different
surgical
techniques
graft
sources
and
graft
fixation
techniques
