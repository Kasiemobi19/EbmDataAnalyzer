Abstract
Text
The
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)
convened
a
Working
Group
in
October
1995
to
summarize
the
data
regarding
the
risk
of
invasive
group
A
streptococcal
(GAS)
disease
among
household
contacts
of
an
index
patient
and
the
potential
efficacy
of
chemoprophylaxis
This
statement
on
chemoprophylaxis
for
prevention
of
subsequent
cases
among
household
contacts
is
intended
for
use
by
public
health
professionals
and
clinicians
The
CDC
invited
representatives
of
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
the
Council
of
State
and
Territorial
Epidemiologists
the
Hospital
Infection
Control
Practice
Advisory
Committee
the
Infectious
Diseases
Society
of
America
and
experts
from
academia
to
participate
Data
on
the
transmission
of
GAS
and
risk
factors
for
severe
infection
were
considered
Population-based
surveillance
data
were
used
to
estimate
the
risk
of
invasive
GAS
disease
among
household
contacts
of
a
case
patient
The
potential
efficacy
of
chemoprophylaxis
was
considered
using
estimates
of
the
efficacy
of
various
regimens
in
eradicating
pharyngeal
carriage
This
document
summarizes
the
data
considered
by
the
Working
Group
to
develop
its
position
The
consensus
achieved
by
group
discussion
at
the
meeting
was
incorporated
in
a
draft
document
which
was
reviewed
by
all
members
and
revised
to
include
suggested
changes
The
Working
Group
concluded
that
no
definite
recommendations
can
be
made
at
this
time
regarding
chemoprophylaxis
for
household
contacts
of
persons
with
invasive
GAS
infection
More
data
are
needed
to
assess
the
risk
of
subsequent
cases
and
to
determine
an
optimal
regimen
for
chemoprophylaxis
Until
such
data
are
available
physicians
and
health
departments
should
base
decisions
regarding
chemoprophylaxis
on
their
assessment
of
the
risk
associated
with
each
individual
case
