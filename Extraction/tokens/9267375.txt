Title
The
effectiveness
and
safety
of
two
cervical
cytologic
techniques
during
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
There
have
been
few
studies
documenting
the
optimal
cervical
cytologic
technique
in
pregnancy
This
study
was
initiated
to
investigate
the
effectiveness
and
safety
of
two
standard
techniques
Two
hundred
twenty-two
new
obstetrical
patients
at
a
family
practice
residency
program
signed
informed
consent
were
enrolled
and
were
randomized
for
cervical
cytologic
screening
using
either
Zelsmyr
Cytobrush
and
Ayre
spatula
or
Dacron
swab
and
Ayre
spatula
The
pathologists
were
blinded
to
the
study
and
results
were
reported
with
standard
Bethesda
System
nomenclature
Patients
were
asked
about
complications
at
follow-up
visits
Statistical
analysis
was
performed
using
Fisher's
exact
test
and
the
two-sample
t
test
with
statistical
significance
set
at
P
<
05
The
Cytobrush-spatula
technique
yielded
956%
(108/113)
smears
with
adequate
endocervical
cells
as
compared
with
697%
(76/109)
of
smears
obtained
with
the
Dacron
swab
and
spatula
(P
=
<
0001
odds
ratio
938)
Cytologic
atypia
defined
as
noninflammatory
cellular
abnormalities
was
uncovered
on
159%
(18/113)
of
the
smears
obtained
with
the
Cytobrush
and
spatula
technique
and
on
138%
(15/109)
of
the
smears
obtained
with
the
Dacron
swab
and
spatula
(P
=
7082)
The
complication
rate
which
included
spot
bleeding
and
spontaneous
abortion
occurred
in
65%
(7/108)
of
the
smears
obtained
with
the
Cytobrush
and
38%
(4/105)
of
the
smears
obtained
with
the
Dacron
swab
(P
=
54)
The
Cytobrush-spatula
technique
significantly
increased
endocervical
cell
yield
did
not
increase
detection
of
cytologic
atypia
and
did
not
increase
the
risk
of
adverse
maternal
or
fetal
outcomes
when
used
for
cervical
cytologic
screening
during
pregnancy
These
results
support
the
use
of
the
Cytobrush-spatula
technique
over
the
swab
and
spatula
for
obtaining
cervical
cytologic
smears
in
pregnancy
