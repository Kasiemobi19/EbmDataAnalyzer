Title
The
natural
history
of
untreated
hyperprolactinemia
a
prospective
analysis
Abstract
Text
This
report
describes
the
results
of
a
long
term
prospective
study
of
30
women
with
hyperprolactinemia
who
were
not
treated
and
who
underwent
yearly
clinical
hormonal
and
radiographic
evaluation
for
an
average
of
52
yr
(range
3-7
yr)
At
entry
into
the
study
18
women
had
amenorrhea
8
had
oligomenorrhea
and
4
had
regular
menstrual
periods
The
initial
mean
serum
PRL
levels
did
not
differ
in
women
grouped
according
to
menstrual
function
Nine
women
(35%)
had
improvement
in
clinical
symptoms
Serum
PRL
decreased
and
menstrual
periods
normalized
more
often
in
those
who
initially
had
oligomenorrhea
or
regular
menstrual
periods
In
most
amenorrheic
women
serum
PRL
levels
did
not
decline
and
menstrual
symptoms
did
not
improve
Six
of
30
women
had
an
increase
in
serum
PRL
14
had
no
change
and
10
had
a
decrease
in
6
of
whom
serum
PRL
was
normal
at
the
last
observation
Twenty-seven
women
had
serial
radiographic
studies
Four
(15%)
of
the
13
women
with
initially
abnormal
radiographic
findings
had
normal
studies
later
2
had
tumor
progression
and
7
no
change
Four
of
14
women
who
had
normal
radiographic
studies
initially
developed
radiographic
evidence
of
a
pituitary
tumor
although
the
radiographic
changes
were
minimal
and
no
patient
developed
a
macroadenoma
or
pituitary
hypofunction
Increases
or
decreases
in
serum
PRL
did
not
accurately
predict
changes
in
tumor
size
Prior
estrogen
use
and
previous
pregnancies
did
not
increase
the
likelihood
of
tumor
appearance
or
enhance
tumor
growth
The
clinical
presentation
of
the
patient
was
an
important
factor
in
predicting
which
patients
had
a
decline
in
serum
PRL
and
resolution
of
symptoms
We
conclude
that
patients
with
hyperprolactinemia
are
unlikely
to
have
progression
of
their
disease
and
may
in
fact
have
clinical
and
radiographic
improvement
