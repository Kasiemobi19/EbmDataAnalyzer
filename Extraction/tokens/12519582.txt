Title
Cardioselective
beta-blockers
for
reversible
airway
disease
Abstract
Text
Beta-blocker
therapy
has
mortality
benefit
in
patients
with
hypertension
heart
failure
and
coronary
artery
disease
as
well
as
during
the
perioperative
period
These
drugs
have
traditionally
been
considered
contraindicated
in
patients
with
reversible
airway
disease
To
assess
the
effect
of
cardioselective
beta-blockers
in
patients
with
asthma
or
COPD
A
search
of
EMBASE
MEDLINE
and
CINAHL
was
performed
up
to
May
2002
using
the
terms
asthma*
bronchial
hyperreactivity*
respiratory
sounds*
wheez*
obstructive
lung
disease*
or
obstructive
airway
disease*
and
adrenergic
antagonist*
sympatholytic*
or
adrenergic
receptor
block*
Randomized
blinded
placebo-controlled
trials
of
single
dose
or
continued
treatment
of
the
effects
of
cardioselective
beta-blockers
in
patients
with
reversible
airway
disease
Two
independent
reviewers
extracted
data
from
the
selected
articles
reconciling
differences
by
consensus
Beta1-blockers
were
divided
into
those
with
or
without
intrinsic
sympathomimetic
activity
(ISA)
Interventions
were
administration
of
single
or
continued
beta1-blocker
and
response
to
beta2-agonist
given
after
the
study
drug
Nineteen
studies
on
single-dose
treatment
and
10
studies
on
continued
treatment
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Single

produced
a

reduction
in

but
with
a
463%
(95%

increase
in
FEV1
with
beta2-agonist
compared
to
placebo
Treatment

With

compared
to

Those
without
ISA
produced
a
120%
increase
in
FEV1
after
beta2-agonist
administration
compared
to
placebo
(95%CI
4121987)
while
beta1-blockers
with
ISA
produced
no
change
compared
to
placebo
(-060%
[95%CI

These
results
were
obtained
in
a
small
number
od
studies
of
few
patients
The
difference
was
not
significant
Cardioselective
beta-blockers
given
in
mild
-
moderate
reversible
airway
disease
or
COPD
do
not
produce
adverse
respiratory
effects
in
the
short
term
Given
their
demonstrated
benefit
in
conditions
such
as
heart
failure
cardiac
arrhythmias
and
hypertension
these
agents
should
not
be
withheld
from
such
patients
but
long
term
safety
(especially
their
impact
during
an
acute
exacerbation)
still
needs
to
be
established
