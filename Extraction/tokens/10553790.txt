Abstract
Text
Many
individuals
involved
with
care
of
the
dying
advocate
expanding
access
to
hospice
care
for
persons
with
advanced
lung
heart
or
liver
disease
However
to
be
eligible
these
patients
generally
must
have
a
prognosis
for
survival
of
less
than
6
months
To
test
the
ability
of
currently
available
criteria
to
identify
a
population
with
a
survival
prognosis
of
6
months
or
less
among
seriously
ill
hospitalized
patients
with
1
of
3
commonly
fatal
chronic
diseases

phase
1
(June
1989-June
1991)
and
phase
2
(January
1992-January
1994)
with
a
6-month
follow-up
Consecutive
sample
of
2607
seriously
ill
patients
from
5
US
medical
centers
who
were
hospitalized
with
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
congestive
heart
failure
or
end-stage
liver
disease
and
who
survived
to
hospital
discharge
Descriptive
and
operating
characteristics
of
5
general
and
2
disease-specific
clinical
criteria
for
identifying
patients
with
a
survival
prognosis
of
6
months
or
less
and
3
sets
of
combination
criteria
(broad
intermediate
and
narrow
inclusion)
aimed
at
providing
low
medium
and
high
thresholds
for
hospice
eligibility
based
on
National
Hospice
Organization
guidelines
Seventy-five
percent
of
the
sample
survived
more
than
6
months
after
hospital
discharge
44%
expressed
a
preference
for
palliative
care
Broad
inclusion
criteria
identified
923
patients
eligible
for
hospice
care
of
whom
70%
survived
longer
than
6
months
Intermediate
inclusion
criteria
identified
300
patients
of
whom
65%
survived
longer
than
6
months
Narrow
inclusion
criteria
identified
19
patients
of
whom
53%
survived
longer
than
6
months
Sensitivities
and
specificities
of
the
combination
criteria
were
417%
and
667%
(broad
inclusion)
162%
and
901
%
(intermediate
inclusion)
and
14%
and
995%
(narrow
inclusion)
respectively
These
data
indicate
that
for
seriously
ill
hospitalized
patients
with
advanced
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
congestive
heart
failure
or
end-stage
liver
disease
recommended
clinical
prediction
criteria
are
not
effective
in
identifying
a
population
with
a
survival
prognosis
of
6
months
or
less
