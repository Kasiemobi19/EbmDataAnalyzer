Does
supervised
exercise
after
deep
venous
thrombosis
improve
recanalization
of
occluded
vein
segments
A
randomized
study
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
weather
early
supervised
exercise
improves
recanalization
of
acute
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
and
reduces
symptoms
From
September
2001
to
March
2004
of
381
patients
72
eligible
patients
were
included
and
with
a
mean
age
54
+/-
14
years
39
(52%)
men
with
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
proven
with
phlebography
were
randomized
to
an
exercise
group
(n
=
36)
receiving
routine
anticoagulation
class
II
compression
stockings
and
additionally
supervised
exercise
and
a
control
group
(n
=
36)
receiving
the
same
therapy
but
no
exercise
Patients
were
followed-up
during
six
months
Phlebography
was
scored
initially
and
at
six-months
There
were
at
inclusion
no
differences
between
the
two
groups
regarding
age
body
weight
body
mass
index
(BMI)
calf
circumference
of
the
affected
leg
and
overall
quality
of
life
estimated
by
visual
analog
scale
(VAS)-scale
In
both
groups
there
were
significant
reductions
regarding
calf
circumference
in
the
affected
leg
compared
to
the
inclusion
time
both
at
one-month
(P
=
00012)
and
six
month
(P
=
00002)
follow-up
The
degree
of
recanalization
of
the
affected
venous
segments
was
high
and
did
not
differ
between
groups
There
were
no
recurrent
DVT
or
pulmonary
emboli
or
other
treatment
complications
in
any
individual
during
the
six-month
follow-up
period
Early
exercise
did
not
acutely
exacerbate
the
risk
of
complications
in
patients
with
DVT
No
benefits
of
early
exercise
were
seen
regarding
the
degree
of
recanalization
of
the
thrombi
or
faster
resolution
of
pain
or
swelling
Nevertheless
our
study
shows
that
early
exercise/ambulation
is
safe
in
combination
with
anticoagulation
and
compression
stockings
for
the
majority
of
patients
with
DVT
