Prevention

events
with
atorvastatin
in
hypertensive

who
have
average
or
lower-than-average
cholesterol

Abstract
Text
The
lowering
of
cholesterol
concentrations
in
individuals
at
high
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
improves
outcome
No
study
however
has
assessed
benefits
of
cholesterol
lowering
in
the
primary
prevention
of
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
in
hypertensive
patients
who
are
not
conventionally
deemed
dyslipidaemic
Of
19342
hypertensive
patients
(aged
40-79
years
with
at
least
three
other
cardiovascular
risk
factors)
randomised
to
one
of
two
antihypertensive
regimens
in
the
Anglo-Scandinavian
Cardiac
Outcomes
Trial
10305
with
non-fasting
total
cholesterol
concentrations
65
mmol/L
or
less
were
randomly
assigned
additional
atorvastatin
10
mg
or
placebo
These
patients
formed
the
lipid-lowering
arm
of
the
study
We
planned
follow-up
for
an
average
of
5
years
the
primary
endpoint
being
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
and
fatal
CHD
Data
were
analysed
by
intention
to
treat
Treatment
was
stopped
after
a
median
follow-up
of
33
years
By
that
time
100
primary
events
had
occurred
in
the
atorvastatin
group
compared
with
154
events
in
the
placebo
group
(hazard
ratio
064
[95%
CI
050-083]
p=00005)
This
benefit
emerged
in
the
first
year
of
follow-up
There
was
no
significant
heterogeneity
among
prespecified
subgroups
Fatal
and
non-fatal
stroke
(89
atorvastatin
vs
121
placebo
073
[056-096]
p=0024)
total
cardiovascular
events
(389
vs
486
079
[069-090]
p=00005)
and
total
coronary
events
(178
vs
247
071
[059-086]
p=00005)
were
also
significantly
lowered
There
were
185
deaths
in
the
atorvastatin
group
and
212
in
the
placebo
group
(087
[071-106]
p=016)
Atorvastatin
lowered
total
serum
cholesterol
by
about
13
mmol/L
compared
with
placebo
at
12
months
and
by
11
mmol/L
after
3
years
of
follow-up
The
reductions
in
major
cardiovascular
events
with
atorvastatin
are
large
given
the
short
follow-up
time
These
findings
may
have
implications
for
future
lipid-lowering
guidelines
