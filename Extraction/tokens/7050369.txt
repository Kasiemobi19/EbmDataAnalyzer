controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Six
weeks
after
acute
myocardial
infarction
303
men
were
randomly
divided
into
exercise
and
control
groups
The
exercise
group
attended
the
hospital
gymnasium
twice
weekly
for
a
three-month
supervised
exercise
course
Both
groups
were
exercise
tested
before
and
after
the
course
and
at
subsequent
follow-up
The
exercise
group
increased
their
physical
fitness
greatly
compared
with
the
control
group
Eight
per
cent
of
the
exercise
group
died
during
the
period
of
follow-up
compared
with
14
per
cent
of
the
control
group
this
difference
is
not
significant
There
was
an
apparent
improvement
in
mortality
in
those
with
inferior
MI
who
completed
the
exercise
course
which
was
not
seen
in
those
with
MI
in
other
sites
For
many
patients
after
MI
progressive
exercise
is
safe
improves
physical
fitness
and
may
reduce
mortality
for
those
after
inferior
MI
