High-sensitivity
C-reactive
protein
in
the
prediction
of
coronary
events
in
patients
with
premature
coronary
artery
disease
Abstract
Text
Inflammation
plays
an
important
role
in
the
initiation
and
progression
of
atherosclerosis
and
in
the
pathogenesis
of
acute
cardiovascular
events
Recent
studies
have
indicated
a
possible
association
between
C-reactive
protein
(CRP)
and
the
clinical
outcome
of
coronary
artery
disease
(CAD)
We
studied
prospectively
in
a
group
of
125
patients
with
premature
CAD
whether
plasma
levels
of
CRP
as
measured
with
a
high-sensitivity
assay
predict
risk
for
future
coronary
events
All
patients
had
stable
CAD
at
time
of
blood
sampling
but
had
originally
been
seen
with
unstable
angina
or
myocardial
infarction
The
mean
follow-up
time
after
blood
collection
was
54
months
and
death
myocardial
infarction
need
for
coronary
revascularization
or
admission
to
hospital
with
angina
pectoris
were
defined
as
clinical
end
points
Patients
in
the
highest
tertile
of
CRP
levels
had
a
>38-fold
risk
(risk
ratio
382
95%
CI
119-1217)
for
death
myocardial
infarction
or
need
for
coronary
revascularization
compared
with
the
patients
in
the
first
tertile
The
relative
risk
for
patients
in
the
second
tertile
was
35-fold
higher
(95%
CI
104-1156)
CRP
levels
in
the
third
tertile
independently
predicted
risk
after
adjustment
for
lipids
and
other
clinical
risk
factors
In
patients
with
clinically
stable
conditions
who
have
a
positive
history
for
acute
coronary
syndromes
before
age
50
years
plasma
levels
of
CRP
higher
than
16
mg/L
are
predictors
of
future
coronary
events
and
therefore
indicate
the
role
of
underlying
chronic
inflammation
for
the
clinical
course
of
CAD
Accordingly
reference
limits
for
prediction
of
risk
in
CAD
have
to
be
lower
in
this
specific
patient
group
than
in
middle-aged
or
elderly
patients
