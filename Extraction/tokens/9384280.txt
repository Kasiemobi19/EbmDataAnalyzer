Abstract
Text
The
serum
antibody
responses
of
splenectomized
patients
with
non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma
(NHL)
who
had
been
immunized
with
a
polyvalent
pneumococcal
vaccine
(Pneumovax
23)
were
evaluated
by
an
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
with
the
23-valent
pneumococcal
vaccine
as
the
antigen
A
response
to
immunization
defined
as
a
twofold-or-higher
rise
of
the
prevaccination
titer
of
antibodies
against
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
polysaccharide
was
elicited
in
5
of
11
patients
with
NHL
No
significant
difference
in
the
level
of
antibodies
against
S
pneumoniae
polysaccharide
between
lymphoma
patients
and
patients
who
had
undergone
splenectomy
for
other
reasons
was
detected
(P
=
083
and
087
before
and
after
vaccination
respectively)
NHL
patients
who
did
not
respond
to
the
first
immunization
received
a
booster
dose
of
the
polysaccharide
vaccine
This
injection
did
not
increase
the
pneumococcal-antibody
titer
significantly
(P
=
07)
We
conclude
that
vaccination
with
pneumococcal
polysaccharides
in
splenectomized
patients
with
NHL
elicits
an
adequate
antibody
response
in
454%
of
the
cases
and
should
therefore
be
administered
Revaccination
of
the
nonresponders
does
not
further
increase
the
pneumococcal-antibody
levels
