Abstract
Text
Household
contacts
<15
years
of
age
of
adults
with
tuberculosis
(TB)
attending
a
reference
center
in
Aracaju
Sergipe
Northeast
Brazil
To
assess
the
use
of
purified
protein
derivative
(PPD)
and
frequency
of
infection
in
children
with
high
Calmette-Guérin
bacillus
(BCG)
coverage
who
were
recently
exposed
to
TB

Cross-sectional
study
of
141
exposed
household
contacts
<15
years
of
age
and
506
nonexposed
neighborhood
controls
Children
were
examined
and
assessed
for
degree
of
exposure
to
index
cases
BCG
vaccination
and
scar
and
were
tested
with
PPD
Exposed
children
were
younger
and
less
up
to
date
in
their
vaccination
schedule
than
controls
(P
<
005)
BCG
had
been
given
to
956%
of
exposed
children
and
974%
of
controls
but
only
809%
of
exposed
vs
885%
of
controls
had
a
scar
(P
<
005)
Scar
sizes
of
exposed
children
were
smaller
(medians
45
and
7
mm
respectively
P
<
005)
Children
had
lower
weight
for
age
z
scores
and
height
than
the
National
Center
for
Health
Statistics
standards
Exposed
children
had
lower
weight
for
age
z
scores
than
controls
(P
<
005)
Sixty-seven
(475%)
exposed
children
and
18
(36%)
controls
had
PPD
readings
of
>10
mm
Positivity
and
induration
sizes
increased
with
age
although
this
was
significant
only
in
the
controls
The
presence
of
a
BCG
scar
was
not
associated
with
having
a
positive
PPD
The
degree
of
exposure
was
an
important
factor
for
PPD
positivity
66
(606%)
of
the
109
children
with
close
exposure
were
positive
compared
with
1
(31%)
of
32
with
less
intimate
exposure
PPD
indurations
among
close
contacts
were
also
larger
than
those
with
restricted
exposure
and
controls
(163
11
and
94
mm
respectively
P
<
005)
PPD
positivity
was
associated
with
the
quantification
of
acid-fast
bacilli
in
the
adult
385%
of
contacts
with
adults
with
sputum
with
(+)
were
positive
compared
with
423%
of
those
with
(++)
and
584%
with
(+++)
(P
<
005)
PPD
is
a
useful
test
to
identify
children
infected
with
TB
independently
of
whether
they
had
received
BCG
or
not
Children
exposed
to
adults
with
TB
are
at
high
risk
of
infection
The
risk
of
infection
is
associated
with
the
intimacy
of
contact
and
the
number
of
bacilli
expectorated
in
sputum
