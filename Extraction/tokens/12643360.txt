Title
Alopecia
in
women
Abstract
Text
Alopecia
can
be
divided
into
disorders
in
which
the
hair
follicle
is
normal
but
the
cycling
of
hair
growth
is
abnormal
and
disorders
in
which
the
hair
follicle
is
damaged
Androgenetic
alopecia
is
the
most
common
cause
of
hair
loss
in
women
Other
disorders
include
alopecia
areata
telogen
effluvium
cicatricial
alopecia
and
traumatic
alopecias
The
diagnosis
is
usually
based
on
a
thorough
history
and
a
focused
physical
examination
In
some
patients
selected
laboratory
tests
or
punch
biopsy
may
be
necessary
Topically
administered
minoxidil
is
labeled
for
the
treatment
of
androgenetic
alopecia
in
women
Corticosteroids
and
other
agents
are
typically
used
in
women
with
alopecia
areata
Telogen
effluvium
is
often
a
self-limited
disorder
Because
alopecia
can
be
devastating
to
women
management
should
include
an
assessment
for
psychologic
effects
