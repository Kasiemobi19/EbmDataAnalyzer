presents
final
1999
data
on
US
deaths
and
death
rates
according
to
demographic
and
medical
characteristics
Trends
and
patterns
in
general
mortality
life
expectancy
and
infant
and
maternal
mortality
are
also
described
A
previous
report
presented
preliminary
mortality
data
for
1999
In
1999
a
total
of
2391399
deaths
were
reported
in
the
United

This

presents
tabulations
of
information
reported
on
the
death
certificates
completed
by
funeral
directors
attending
physicians
medical
examiners
and
coroners
Original
records
are
filed
in
the
State
registration
offices
Statistical
information
is
compiled
into
a
national
data
base
through
the
Vital
Statistics
Cooperative
Program
of
the
National
Center
for
Health
Statistics
(NCHS)
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
For
the
first
time
in
a
final
mortality
data
report
age-adjusted
death
rates
are
based
upon
the
year
2000
population
and
causes
of
death
are
processed
in
accordance
with
the
Tenth
Revision
of
the
International
Classification
of
Diseases
(ICD-10)
The
1999
age-adjusted
death
rate
for
the
United
States
was
8819
deaths
per
100000
standard
population
a
07
percent
increase
from
the
1998
rate
and
life
expectancy
at
birth
remained
the
same
at
767
years
For
all
causes
of
death
age-specific
death
rates
rose
for
those
45-54
years
75-84
years
and
85
years
and
over
and
declined
for
a
number
of
age
groups
including
those
5-14
years
55-64
years
and
65-74
years
Aortic
aneurysm
and
dissection
made
its
debut
in
the
list
of
leading
causes
of
death
and
atherosclerosis
exited
from
the
list
Heart
disease
and
cancer
continued
to
be
the
leading
and
second
leading
causes
of
death
The
age-adjusted
death
rate
for
firearm
injuries
decreased
for
the
sixth
consecutive
year
declining
62
percent
between
1998
and
1999
The
infant
mortality
rate
71
infant
deaths
per
1000
live
births
was
not
statistically
different
from
the
rate
in
1998
Generally
mortality
continued
long-term
trends
Life
expectancy
in
1999
was
unchanged
from
1998
despite
a
slight
increase
in
the
age-adjusted
death
rate
from
the
record
low
achieved
in
1998
Although
statistically
unchanged
from
1998
the
trend
in
infant
mortality
has
been
of
a
steady
but
slowing
decline
Some
mortality
measures
for
women
and
persons
85
years
and
over
worsened
between
1998
and
1999
