Outcomes
in
hypertensive
patients
at
high
cardiovascular
risk
treated
with
regimens
based
on
valsartan
or
amlodipine
the
VALUE
randomised
trial
Abstract
Text
The
Valsartan
Antihypertensive
Long-term
Use
Evaluation
(VALUE)
trial
was
designed
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
for
the
same
blood-pressure
control
valsartan
would
reduce
cardiac
morbidity
and
mortality
more
than
amlodipine
in
hypertensive
patients
at
high
cardiovascular
risk
15245
patients
aged
50
years
or
older
with
treated
or
untreated
hypertension
and
high
risk
of
cardiac
events
participated
in
a
randomised
double-blind
parallel-group
comparison
of
therapy
based
on
valsartan
or
amlodipine
Duration
of
treatment
was
event-driven
and
the
trial
lasted
until
at
least
1450
patients
had
reached
a
primary
endpoint
defined
as
a
composite
of
cardiac
mortality
and
morbidity
Patients
from
31
countries
were
followed
up
for
a
mean
of
42
years
Blood
pressure
was
reduced
by
both
treatments
but
the
effects
of
the
amlodipine-based
regimen
were
more
pronounced
especially
in
the
early
period
(blood
pressure
40/21
mm
Hg
lower
in
amlodipine
than
valsartan
group
after
1
month
15/13
mm
Hg
after
1
year
p<0001
between
groups)
The
primary
composite
endpoint
occurred
in
810
patients
in
the
valsartan
group
(106%
255
per
1000
patient-years)
and
789
in
the
amlodipine
group
(104%
247
per
1000
patient-years
hazard
ratio
104
95%
CI
094-115
p=049)
The
main
outcome
of
cardiac
disease
did
not
differ
between
the
treatment
groups
Unequal
reductions
in
blood
pressure
might
account
for
differences
between
the
groups
in
cause-specific
outcomes
The
findings
emphasise
the
importance
of
prompt
blood-pressure
control
in
hypertensive
patients
at
high
cardiovascular
risk
