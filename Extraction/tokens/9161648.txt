Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
ability
of
a
novel
topical
antimicrobial
gel
containing
cetrimide
bacitracin
and
polymyxin
B
sulfate
to
prevent
infections
of
minor
wounds
A
clinical
trial
compared
the
test
preparation
with
placebo
and
a
povidone
iodine
antiseptic
cream
Five
primary
schools
in
Sydney
Australia
participated
in
the
study
over
a
6-week
spring/summer
school
term
Children
aged
5-12
years
with
parental
consent
were
eligible
for
study
participation
Accidental
injuries
occurring
at
school
were
treated
in
a
standardized
manner
by
nurses
at
each
site
Wounds
were
evaluated
by
the
medical
practitioner
after
3
days
of
topical
treatment
The
clinical
outcome
was
classified
as
resolution
or
suspected
infection
If
a
clinical
infection
was
suspected
the
injury
was
swabbed
for
microbiologic
evaluation
Growth
of
a
dominant
microorganism
was
classified
as
a
microbiologic
infection
Of
the
177
injuries
treated
there
were
nine
clinical
infections
A
comparison
of
these
showed
a
significant
difference
among
treatment
groups
(p
<
005)
This
difference
was
associated
with
the
test
preparation
and
placebo
the
test
preparation
reduced
the
incidence
of
clinical
infection
from
125%
to
16%
(p
<
005
95%
CI
0011
to
0207)
A
comparison
of
microbiologic
infections
showed
no
significant
differences
among
treatment
groups
(p
>
005)
The
novel
gel
preparation
containing
cetrimide
bacitracin
and
polymyxin
B
sulfate
showed
therapeutic
action
and
reduced
the
incidence
of
clinical
infections
in
minor
accidental
wounds
It
may
be
a
suitable
product
for
first
aid
prophylaxis
