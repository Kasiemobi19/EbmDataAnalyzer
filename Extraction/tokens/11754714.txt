Does
this
patient
have
temporal
arteritis
Abstract
Text
Clinicians
must
be
able
to
confidently
diagnose
temporal
arteritis
(TA)
since
failure
to
make
a
correct
diagnosis
may
lead
to
irreversible
visual
loss
as
well
as
inappropriate
evaluation
and
treatment
of
headache
fatigue
and
other
potential
presenting
symptoms
The
diagnostic
value
of
particular
signs
and
symptoms
among
patients
with
suspected
TA
is
unknown
To
determine
the
accuracy
of
historical
features
physical
examination
and
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
(ESR)
in
diagnosis
of
TA
We
performed
a
MEDLINE
search
of
English-language
articles
published
between
January
1966
and
July
2000
and
a
hand
search
of
bibliographies
of
retrieved
articles
previous
reviews
monographs
and
textbooks
Studies
that
provided
detailed
clinical
information
on
patients
who
had
been
referred
for
temporal
artery
biopsy
Of
114
studies
retrieved
41
met
our
inclusion
criteria
21
included
both
biopsy-positive
and
biopsy-negative
patients
and
formed
the
core
of
our
review
Both
authors
independently
reviewed
each
study
to
determine
eligibility
abstracted
data
using
a
standardized
instrument
and
classified
study
quality
using
predetermined
criteria
The
prevalence
of
TA
in
the
general
population
is
less
than
1%
However
in
our
21
core
studies
39%
of
patients
referred
for
temporal
artery
biopsy
had
positive
results
The
only
2
historical
features
that
substantially
increased
the
likelihood
of
TA
among
patients
referred
for
biopsy
were
jaw
claudication
(positive
likelihood
ratio
[LR]
42
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
28-62)
and
diplopia
(positive
LR
34
95%
CI
13-86)
The
absence
of
any
temporal
artery
abnormality
was
the
only
clinical
factor
that
modestly
reduced
the
likelihood
of
disease
(negative
LR
053
95%
CI
038-075)
Predictive
physical
findings
included
temporal
artery
beading
(positive
LR
46
95%
CI
11-184)
prominence
(positive
LR
43
95%
CI
21-89)
and
tenderness
(positive
LR
26
95%
CI
19-37)
Normal
ESR
values
indicated
much
less
likelihood
of
disease
(negative
LR
for
abnormal
ESR
02
95%
CI
008-051)
A
small
number
of
clinical
features
are
helpful
in
predicting
the
likelihood
of
a
positive
temporal
artery
biopsy
among
patients
with
a
clinical
suspicion
of
disease
the
most
useful
finding
is
a
normal
ESR
which
makes
TA
unlikely
