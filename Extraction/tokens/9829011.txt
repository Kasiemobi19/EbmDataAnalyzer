Sensitivity
and

of

Anxiety
Screening
Questionnaire
(ASQ-15)
Abstract
Text
The
paper
describes
the
rationale
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
the
Anxiety
Screening
Questionnaire
(ASQ)
a
disorder-specific
screening
instrument
for
use
in
primary
care
Two
hundred
and
fifty
subjects
sampled
from
psychiatric
primary
care
settings
and
the
community
participated
in
a
test-retest
reliability
as
well
as
a
procedural
validity
study
using
the
M-CIDI
with
DSM-IV
algorithms
as
a
diagnostic
yardstick
The
ASQ
was
found
to
be
easy
to
administer
and
acceptable
and
efficient
in
terms
of
sensitivity
and
specificity
for
generalised
anxiety
syndromes
The
test-retest
item
reliability
was
good
to
excellent
with
kappa
values
of
06
or
above
As
compared
with
the
validity
standard
the
DSM-IV/CIDI
diagnoses
caseness
sensitivity
was
generally
high
(above
82%)
for
all
diagnostic
domains
covered
whereas
the
specificity
was
only
high
for
DSM-IV
threshold
and
subthreshold
generalised
anxiety
disorder
These
preliminary
findings
demonstrate
the
usefulness
of
this
anxiety
screening
questionnaire
constructed
closely
following
the
guidelines
of
specific
diagnostic
criteria
