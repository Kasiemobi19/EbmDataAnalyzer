Title
A
practical
approach
to
the
diagnosis
of
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
Abstract
Text
The
diagnosis
of
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS)
is
primarily
achieved
through
clinical
history
and
physical
findings
The
principle
features
are
hirsutism
or
biochemical
evidence
of
excess
androgen
production
and
irregular
menstrual
bleeding
caused
by
the
chronic
anovulation
Associated
findings
include
insulin
resistance
with
compensatory
hyperinsulinemia
and
obesity
Ultrasound
imaging
of
the
ovary
has
facilitated
the
diagnosis
It
is
important
to
exclude
conditions
that
may
mimic
PCOS
such
as
hyperthecosis
congenital
adrenal
hyperplasia
21-hydroxylase
deficiency
Cushing's
syndrome
and
androgen-producing
neoplasms
These
disorders
are
usually
revealed
by
appropriate
laboratory
assessment
Screening
tests
include
measurement
of
serum
total
testosterone
DHEA
sulfate
and
17-hydroxyprogesterone
In
addition
in
the
obese
individual
determinations
of
glucose
and
insulin
levels
as
well
as
a
lipid
profile
are
highly
recommended
