Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
strength
of
evidence
for
the
effectiveness
of
mental
health
interventions
for
patients
with
three
common
somatic
conditions
(chronic
fatigue
syndrome
irritable
bowel
syndrome
and
chronic
back
pain)
To
assess
whether
results
obtained
in
secondary
care
can
be
extrapolated
to
primary
care
and
suggest
how
future
trials
should
be
designed
to
provide
more
rigorous
evidence
Systematic
review
Five
electronic
databases
key
texts
references
in
the
articles
identified
and
citations
from
expert
clinicians
Randomised
controlled
trials
including
participants
with
one
of
the
three
conditions
for
which
no
physical
cause
could
be
found
Two
reviewers
screened
sources
and
independently
extracted
data
and
assessed
quality
Sixty
one
studies
were
identified
20
were
classified
as
primary
care
and
41
as
secondary
care
For
some
interventions
such
as
brief
psychodynamic
interpersonal
therapy
little
research
was
identified
However
results
of
meta-analyses
and
of
randomised
controlled
trials
suggest
that
cognitive
behaviour
therapy
and
behaviour
therapy
are
effective
for
chronic
back
pain
and
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
and
that
antidepressants
are
effective
for
irritable
bowel
syndrome
Cognitive
behaviour
therapy
and
behaviour
therapy
were
effective
in
both
primary
and
secondary
care
in
patients
with
back
pain
although
the
evidence
is
more
consistent
and
the
effect
size
larger
for
secondary
care
Antidepressants
seem
effective
in
irritable
bowel
syndrome
in
both
settings
but
ineffective
in
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
Treatment
seems
to
be
more
effective
in
patients
in
secondary
care
than
in
primary
care
This
may
be
because
secondary
care
patients
have
more
severe
disease
they
receive
a
different
treatment
regimen
or
the
intervention
is
more
closely
supervised
However
conclusions
of
effectiveness
should
be
considered
in
the
light
of
the
methodological
weaknesses
of
the
studies
Large
pragmatic
trials
are
needed
of
interventions
delivered
in
primary
care
by
appropriately
trained
primary
care
staff
