Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
evidence
for
the
efficacy
of
local
treatments
for
cutaneous
warts
Systematic
review
of
randomised
controlled
trials
Total
clearance
of
warts
and
adverse
effects
such
as
irritation
pain
and
blistering
Randomised
controlled
trials
of
any
local
treatment
for
uncomplicated
cutaneous
warts
All
published
and
unpublished
material
was
considered
with
no
restriction
on
date
or
language
50
included
trials
provided
generally
weak
evidence
because
of
poor
methods
and
reporting
The
best
evidence
was
for
topical
treatments
containing
salicylic
acid
Data
pooled
from
six
placebo
controlled
trials
showed
a
cure
rate
of
75%
(144
of
191)
in
cases
compared
with
48%
(89
of
185)
in
controls
(odds
ratio
391
95%
confidence
interval
240
to
636)
Some
evidence
for
the
efficacy
of
contact
immunotherapy
was
provided
by
two
small
trials
comparing
dinitrochlorobenzene
with
placebo
Evidence
for
the
efficacy
of
cryotherapy
was
limited
No
consistent
evidence
was
found
for
the
efficacy
of
intralesional
bleomycin
and
only
limited
evidence
was
found
for
the
efficacy
of
topical
fluorouracil
intralesional
interferons
photodynamic
therapy
and
pulsed
dye
laser
Reviewed
trials
of
local
treatments
for
cutaneous
warts
were
highly
variable
in
methods
and
quality
and
there
was
a
paucity
of
evidence
from
randomised
placebo
controlled
trials
on
which
to
base
the
rational
use
of
the
treatments
There
is
good
evidence
that
topical
treatments
containing
salicylic
acid
have
a
therapeutic
effect
and
some
evidence
for
the
efficacy
of
dinitrochlorobenzene
Less
evidence
was
found
for
the
efficacy
of
all
the
other
treatments
reviewed
including
cryotherapy
