Correction
of
insulin
resistance
and
hyperandrogenism
in
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
by
combined
rosiglitazone
and
clomiphene
citrate
therapy
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
effects
of
combined
rosiglitazone
and
clomiphene
citrate
versus
clomiphene
citrate
monotherapy
on
serum
insulin-like
growth
factor
1
(IGF-1)
and
insulin-like
growth
factor
binding
protein
3
(IGFBP-3)
levels
in
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS)
and
to
evaluate
these
therapeutic
interventions
in
the
link
between
hyperinsulinemia
and
hormonal
perturbations
in
PCOS
We
performed
a
randomized
clinical
study
at
the
King
Abul-Aziz
and
Cairo
University
Hospitals
We
studied
50
women
with
PCOS
Clinical
diagnosis
was
based
on
hyperandrogenism
hyperinsulinism
oligomenorrhea
or
amenorrhea
anovulatory
cycles
and
ultrasonographic
findings
They
were
randomly
assigned
to
two
groups
of
25
women
each
One
group
was
treated
with
rosiglitazone
and
clomiphene
citrate
the
other
was
treated
only
with
clomiphene
citrate
Serum
concentrations
of
luteinizing
hormone
(LH)
follicle-stimulating
hormone
(FSH)
estradiol
dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate
(DHEAS)
free
testosterone
IGF-1
and
IFGBP-3
were
measured
by
specific
radioimmunoassays
before
and
after
treatment
Combined
rosiglitazone
and
clomiphene
treatment
led
to
a
significant
reduction
in
area
under
the
insulin
curve
(AUC
insulin)
whereas
clomiphene
monotherapy
did
not
lead
to
this
reduction
Both
types
of
treatment
induced
a
significant
decrease
in
LH
LHFSH
ratio
free
testosterone
and
IGF1IGBP-3
ratio
and
were
associated
with
a
significant
increase
in
IGFBP-3
levels
These
changes
were
more
pronounced
in
PCOS
patients
treated
with
combined
rosiglitazone
and
clomiphene
than
in
those
treated
with
clomiphene
monotherapy
Regular
menstrual
cycles
occurred
in
72%
of
the
former
group
and
48%
of
the
latter
Combined
rosiglitazone
and
clomiphene
was
an
effective
therapeutic
regimen
for
correcting
insulin
resistance
in
patients
with
PCOS
possibly
by
reducing
IGF1
bioavailability
to
the
ovaries
thus
modifying
the
hyperandrogenic
intrafollicular
milieu
that
occurs
in
PCOS
In
addition
the
clinical
and
hormonal
responses
were
better
than
with
clomiphene
alone
