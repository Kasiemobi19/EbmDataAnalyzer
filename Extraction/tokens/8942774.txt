Randomised
study
of
screening
for
colorectal
cancer
with
faecal-occult-blood
test
Abstract
Text
Case-control
studies
and
a
voluntary-based
follow-up
study
have
suggested
that
repeated
screening
with
faecal-occult-blood
(FOB)
tests
can
lead
to
a
reduction
in
mortality
from
colorectal
cancer
(CRC)
The
aim
of
this
randomised
study
was
to
compare
mortality
rates
after
FOB
tests
every
2
years
during
a
10-year
period
with
those
of
unscreened
similar
controls
140000
people
aged
45-75
years
lived
in
Funen
Denmark
in
August
1985
and
were
considered
for
inclusion
in
our
study
Before
randomisation
we
excluded
individuals
who
had
CRC
or
precursor
adenomas
and
those
who
had
taken
part
in
a
previous
pilot
study
Randomisation
of
137485
people
in
blocks
of
14
allocated
three
per
14
to
the
screening
group
(30967)
three
per
14
to
the
control
group
(30966)
and
eight
not
to
be
enrolled
in
the
study
(75552)
Controls
were
not
told
about
the
study
and
continued
to
use
health-care
facilities
as
normal
Hemoccult-II
blood
tests
(with
dietary
restrictions
but
without
rehydration)
were
sent
to
screening-group
participants
Only
those
participants
who
completed
the
first
screening
round
were
invited
for
further
screening--five
rounds
of
screening
during
a
10-year
period
Participants
with
positive
tests
were
asked
to
attend
to
full
examination
and
were
offered
colonoscopy
whenever
possible
The
primary
endpoint
was
death
from
CRC
Of
the
30967
screening-group
participants
20672
(67%)
completed
the
first
screening
round
and
were
invited
for
further
screening
more
than
90%
accepted
repeated
screenings
During
the
10-year
study
481
people
in
the
screening
group
had
a
diagnosis
of
CRC
compared
with
483
unscreened
controls
There
were
205
deaths
attributable
to
CRC
in
the
screening
group
compared
with
249
deaths
in
controls
CRC
mortality
including
deaths
attributable
to
complications
from
CRC
treatment
was
significantly
lower
in
the
screening
group
than
in
controls
(mortality
ratio
082
[95%
CI
068-099])
p
=
003)
Our
findings
indicate
that
biennial
screening
by
FOB
tests
can
reduce
CRC
mortality
This
study
is
being
continued
to
improve
its
statistical
power
and
to
assess
the
effect
of
the
removal
of
more
precursor
adenomas
in
the
screening-group
participants
than
in
controls
on
CRC
incidence
