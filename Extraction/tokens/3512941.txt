Chronic
cough
in
infants
and
children
Abstract
Text
Chronic
cough
is
an
important
sometimes
frustrating
problem
often
encountered
by
the
otolaryngologist-head
and
neck
surgeon
Thirty-eight
infants
and
children
under
age
16
with
a
normal
chest
roentgenogram
were
evaluated
for
chronic
cough
persisting
for
longer
than
4
weeks
Specific
therapy
(rather
than
symptomatic
treatment)
of
chronic
cough
lead
to
a
resolution
or
control
of
the
cough
in
33
(87%)
Cough-variant
asthma
was
by
far
the
most
common
cause
of
chronic
cough
followed
by
sinusitis
aberrant
innominate
artery
psychogenic
cough
and
subglottic
stenosis
In
addition
to
a
detailed
history
physical
examination
and
chest
roentgenogram
endoscopy
paranasal
sinus
roentgenograms
and
pulmonary
function
studies
with
methacholine
challenge
testing
were
particularly
effective
for
establishing
a
precise
diagnosis
Chronic
cough
is
best
managed
by
determining
the
precise
cause
of
the
cough
then
specifically
treating
the
underlying
disorder
Children
with
persistent
cough
and
a
normal
chest
roentgenogram
should
be
referred
promptly
for
evaluation
by
an
otolaryngologist
when
the
primary
physician's
initial
efforts
at
diagnosis
and
treatment
are
unsuccessful
Endoscopy
is
under-utilized
in
practice
and
its
importance
is
understated
in
the
literature
It
is
particularly
helpful
in
establishing
a
precise
diagnosis
in
infants
under
18
months
of
age
