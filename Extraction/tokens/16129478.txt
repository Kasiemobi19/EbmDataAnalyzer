Abstract
Text
Family
screening
programs
for
intracranial
aneurysms
have
been
considered
but
there
are
concerns
about
raised
anxiety
and
depression
inadequate
risk
perception
and
the
principle
of
informed
choice
Observational
study
in
980
first-degree
relatives
of
172
patients
with
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
After
being
informed
consenting
subjects
completed
the
Hospital
Anxiety
and
Depression
Scale
(HADS)
answered
standardized
questions
on
perceived
risk
and
responded
to
a
list
of
statements
about
the
decision-making
process
166
subjects
(21%)
declined
the
screening
offer
12%
of
the
participants
reported
HADS
anxiety
scores
in
the
moderate
to
severe
range
2%
did
so
for
feelings
of
depression
All
relatives
substantially
underestimated
the
risk
of
harboring
an
aneurysm
and
of
aneurysm
rupture
98%
of
the
participants
(96%
of
non-participants
P
=
060)
reported
feeling
free
to
make
a
choice
while
31%
of
the
participants
(42%
of
non-participants
P
=
016)
felt
more
or
less
compelled
to
participate
in
the
screening
program
The
invitation
to
a
family
screening
program
for
intracranial
aneurysms
does
not
lead
to
increased
feelings
of
anxiety
or
depression
The
unrealistic
risk
perception
stresses
the
need
of
clear
and
detailed
information
Attention
should
be
given
to
factors
that
may
interfere
with
the
principle
of
informed
choice
