Abstract
Text
This
study
examined
the
Panic
Disorder
Self-Report
(PDSR)
a
new
self-report
diagnostic
measure
of
panic
disorder
based
on
the
4th
edition
of
the
Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manual
of
Mental
Disorders
(American
Psychiatric
Association
1994)
PDSR
diagnoses
were
compared
with
structured
interview
diagnoses
of
individuals
with
generalized
anxiety
disorder
social
phobia
and
panic
disorder
and
nonanxious
controls
Receiver
operating
characteristic
analyses
revealed
that
the
PDSR
showed
100%
specificity
and
89%
sensitivity
The
PDSR
also
demonstrated
retest
reliability
convergent
and
discriminant
validity
and
kappa
agreement
of
93
with
a
structured
interview
Finally
the
PDSR
demonstrated
clinical
validity
Students
who
were
identified
as
having
panic
disorder
using
the
PDSR
did
not
have
significantly
different
scores
on
the
Panic
Disorder
Severity
Scale--Self-Report
form
(P

Houck

Speigel

K
Shear
&
P
Rucci

than
a
panic
disordered
community
sample
However
both
groups
had
significantly
higher
scores
than
students
identified
as
not
meeting
criteria
for
panic
disorder
