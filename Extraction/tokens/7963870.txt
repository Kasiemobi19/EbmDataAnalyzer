Acute
and
long-term
effect
of
elastic
stockings
in
patients
with
varicose
veins
Abstract
Text
The
acute
and
long-term
effect
of
elastic
stockings
has
been
evaluated
in
20
patients
(20
limbs)
with
grade
2
venous
disease
The
sites
of
venous
reflux
were
determined
with
colour
flow
duplex
scanning
Air
Plethysmography
was
used
to
measure
the
amount
of
venous
reflux
and
the
ejecting
capacity
of
the
calf
muscle
pump
The
patients
were
classified
in
to
two
different
groups
A
and
B
Both
groups
of
patients
wore
elastic
stockings
for
four
weeks
In
group
A
(no
=
9)
the
measurements
were
done
before
during
and
one
day
after
the
removal
of
the
stockings
whereas
in
group
B
(no
=
11)
the
last
measurements
were
done
immediately
after
the
removal
of
the
stockings
Patients
that
showed
improvement
in
their
haemodynamics
were
re-examined
a
week
later
Elastic
compression
appeared
to
be
beneficial
in
both
groups
The
application
of
the
elastic
stockings
improved
reflux
and
the
residual
volume
fraction
in
both
groups
and
the
ejecting
capacity
of
the
calf
muscle
pump
in
group
B
Immediately
after
the
removal
of
the
stockings
(Group
B)
all
the
measurements
regressed
to
the
initial
values
with
the
exemption
of
the
residual
volume
fraction
However
one
week
later
the
latter
also
regressed
to
the
original
value
It
is
concluded
that
the
beneficial
effect
of
elastic
stockings
on
the
venous
haemodynamics
is
present
mainly
when
the
stockings
are
worn
It
is
completely
abolished
within
a
day
after
their
removal
