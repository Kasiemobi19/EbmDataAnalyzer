Dietary
fat
fat
subtypes
and
breast
cancer
in
postmenopausal
women
a
prospective
cohort
study
Abstract
Text
The
intake
of
total
dietary
fat
and
of
certain
fat
subtypes
has
been
shown
to
be
strongly
associated
with
breast
cancer
in
international
comparisons
and
in
animal
experiments
However
observational
epidemiologic
studies
have
generally
reported
either
weak
positive
or
no
associations
To
extend
the
prospective
epidemiologic
evidence
on
this
question
we
examined
the
association
between
adult
dietary
intake
of
fat
fat
subtypes
and
breast
cancer
in
a
large
prospective
cohort
of
postmenopausal
women
Participants
were
selected
from
a
national
breast
cancer
mammography
screening
program
conducted
from
1973
through
1981
at
29
centers
throughout
the
United
States
From
1987
through
1989
40022
postmenopausal
women
satisfactorily
completed
a
mailed
self-administered
questionnaire
that
included
a
60-item
National
Cancer
Institute/Block
food-frequency
questionnaire
Women
were
then
followed
for
an
average
of
53
years
996
women
developed
breast
cancer
Risk
was
assessed
by
use
of
Cox
proportional
hazard
regression
with
age
as
the
underlying
time
metric
All
statistical
tests
were
two-sided
Compared
with
women
in
the
lowest
quintile
(Q1)
of
percentage
of
energy
from
total
fat
the
adjusted
risk
ratio
(RR)
and
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
for
women
in
the
highest
quintile
(Q5)
was
107
(95%
CI
=
086-132)
In
analyses
stratified
by
history
of
benign
breast
disease
(BBD)
a
positive
association
was
observed
among
only
women
with
no
history
of
BBD
(RR
(Q5
versus
Q1)
=
220
95%
CI
=
141-342
test
for
trend
P
=0003)
The
increased
risk
in
these
women
appeared
to
be
attributable
to
unsaturated
fat
intake
and
oleic
acid
in
particular
In
this
study
there
was
no
overall
association
between
fat
intake
during
adulthood
and
breast
cancer
risk
however
among
women
with
no
history
of
BBD
there
appeared
to
be
a
positive
association
between
total
and
unsaturated
fat
intake
and
breast
cancer
risk
