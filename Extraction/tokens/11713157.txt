Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effectiveness
of
a
cotinine-feedback
behaviorally
based
education
intervention
in
reducing
environmental
tobacco
smoke
(ETS)
exposure
and
health-care
utilization
of
children
with
asthma
Randomized
controlled
trial
of
educational
intervention
vs
usual
care
The
pediatric
pulmonary
service
of
a
regional
pediatric
hospital
ETS-exposed
Medicaid/Medi-Cal-eligible
predominantly
minority
children
who
were
3
to
12
years
old
and
who
were
seen
for
asthma
in
the
hospital's
emergency
inpatient
and
outpatient
services
departments
(n
=
87)
Three
nurse-led
sessions
employing
behavior-changing
strategies
and
basic
asthma
education
and
that
incorporated
repeated
feedback
on
the
child's
urinary
cotinine
level
The
primary
measurements
were
the
urinary
cotinine/creatinine
ratio
(CCR)
and
the
number
of
acute
asthma
medical
visits
The
secondary
measurements
were
number
of
hospitalizations
smoking
restrictions
in
home
amount
smoked
reported
exposures
of
children
and
asthma
control
The
intervention
was
associated
with
a
significantly
lower
odds
ratio
(OR)
for
more
than
one
acute
asthma
medical
visit
in
the
follow-up
year
after
adjusting
for
baseline
visits
(total
visits
87
OR
032
p
=
003)
and
a
comparably
sized
but
nonsignificant
OR
for
one
or
more
hospitalization
(OR
034
p
=
014)
The
follow-up
CCR
measurement
and
the
determination
of
whether
smoking
was
prohibited
inside
the
home
strongly
favored
the
intervention
group
(n
=
51)
(mean
difference
in
CCR
adjusted
for
baseline
-038
p
=
026
n
=
51)
(60
OR
[for
proportion
of
subjects
prohibiting
smoking]
024
p
=
011
n
=
60)
This
intervention
significantly
reduced
asthma
health-care
utilization
in
ETS-exposed
low-income
minority
children
Effects
sizes
for
urine
cotinine
and
proportion
prohibiting
smoking
were
moderate
to
large
but
not
statistically
significant
possibly
the
result
of
reduced
precision
due
to
the
loss
of
patients
to
active
follow-up
Improving
ETS
reduction
interventions
and
understanding
their
mechanism
of
action
on
asthma
outcomes
requires
further
controlled
trials
that
measure
ETS
exposure
and
behavioral
and
disease
outcomes
concurrently
