Chronic
persistent
cough
Experience
in
diagnosis
and
outcome
using
an
anatomic
diagnostic
protocol
Abstract
Text
Irwin
and
co-workers
have
designed
an
anatomic
approach
to
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
cough
In
their
hands
diagnosis
was
consistently
determined
and
treatment
successful
almost
without
exception
if
sustained
We
reviewed
the
results
of
a
similar
approach
in
139
consecutive
and
unselected
patients
referred
to
pulmonary
specialists
in
two
community
hospitals
Thirty-nine
patients
demonstrated
hyperreactive
airways
(HA)
by
carbachol
inhalation
and/or
eucapnic
hyperventilation
of
cold
air
Twenty-seven
of
78
without
HA
had
postnasal
drip
and
13
of
78
had
a
persistent
cough
following
acute
upper
airway
inflammation
Other
less
common
diagnoses
included
chronic
bronchitis
gastro-esophageal
reflux
occupational
bronchitis
interstitial
lung
disease
and
psychologic
causes
We
were
able
to
find
the
cause
of
cough
88
percent
of
the
time
Treatment
adjusted
for
noncompliance
was
not
always
a
success
While
all
patients
with
HA
improved
8
percent
of
patients
without
HA
or
specific
diagnosis
did
not
have
an
improvement
in
their
cough
upon
retrospective
inquiry
Based
on
this
analysis
we
find
that
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
cough
may
not
be
as
successful
as
originally
reported
using
Irwin's
approach
