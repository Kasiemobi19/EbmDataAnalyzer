Abstract
Text
To
review
a
26-year
single-center
clinical
experience
with
inferior
vena
caval
filters
During
1973-1998
1765
filters
were
implanted
in
1731
patients
Hospital
files
were
reviewed
and
data
were
collected
about
the
indications
safety
effectiveness
numbers
and
types
of
caval
filters
Fatal
post-filter
pulmonary
embolism
(PE)
was
considered
the
primary
outcome
Morbidity
and
mortality
were
determined
as
secondary
outcomes
Survival
and
morbidity-free
survival
curves
were
calculated
The
prevalence
of
observed
post-filter
PE
was
56%
It
was
fatal
in
37%
of
patients
In
most
patients
fatal
PE
occurred
soon
after
filter
insertion
(median
40
days
95%
CI
22
58
days)
Major
complications
occurred
in
03%
of
procedures
The
prevalence
of
observed
post-filter
caval
thrombosis
was
27%
The
30-day
mortality
rate
was
170%
overall
higher
among
patients
with
neoplasms
(195%)
as
compared
with
those
without
neoplasms
(143%
P
=004)
Filter
efficacy
and
associated
morbidity
were
not
different
in
46
patients
with
suprarenal
filters
The
rate
of
filters
placed
for
prophylaxis
was
47%
overall
and
increased
to
164%
in
1998
From
1980
to
1996
there
was
a
fivefold
increase
in
the
number
of
caval
filter
implants
In
recent
years
more
filters
were
implanted
in
younger
patients
Inferior
vena
caval
filters
provide
protection
from
life-threatening
PE
with
minimal
morbidity
