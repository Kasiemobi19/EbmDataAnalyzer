Title
Safety
and
efficacy
of
black
cohosh
(Cimicifuga
racemosa)
during
pregnancy
and
lactation
Abstract
Text
There
is
a
lack
of
basic
knowledge
on
the
part
of
both
clinicians
and
patients
as
to
the
indications
for
use
and
safety
of
herbal
medicines
in
pregnancy
and
lactation
This
is
one
article
in
a
series
that
systematically
reviews
the
evidence
for
commonly
used
herbs
during
pregnancy
and
lactation
To
systematically
review
the
literature
for
evidence
on
the
use
safety
and
pharmacology
of
black
cohosh
focusing
on
issues
pertaining
to
pregnancy
and
lactation
We
searched
7
electronic
databases
and
compiled
data
according
to
the
grade
of
evidence
found
Black
cohosh
alone
or
in
combination
with
other
medicinal
herbs
as
"mother's
cordial"
has
a
long
traditional
use
and
is
frequently
used
by
midwives
as
a
uterine
stimulant
and
labour-inducing
aid
Low-level
evidence
based
on
theory
and
expert
opinion
shows
the
following
concerns
with
respect
to
black
cohosh
use
during
pregnancy
1)
labour-inducing
effects
2)
hormonal
effects
3)
emmenagogue
properties
and
4)
anovulatory
effects
During
lactation
there
is
low-level
evidence
from
theoretical
and
expert
opinion
of
black
cohosh
having
hormonal
properties
Black
cohosh
should
be
used
with
caution
during
pregnancy
particularly
during
the
first
trimester
where
its
purported
labour-inducing
effects
could
be
of
concern
and
during
lactation
Black
cohosh
should
undergo
rigorous
high
quality
human
studies
to
determine
its
safety
in
pregnancy
and
lactation
