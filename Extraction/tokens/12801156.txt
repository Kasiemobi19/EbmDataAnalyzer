Is
subjective

correlated
with
MMSE
scores
or
dementia
Abstract
Text
(1)
To
determine
if
subjective
memory
loss
(SML)
is
associated
with
Mini-Mental
State
Examination
(MMSE)
scores
(2)
to
determine
if
this
association
persists
after
adjustment
for
other
factors
and
(3)
to
determine
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
SML
for
dementia
1751
seniors
sampled
from
a
population
registry
Age
sex
education
SML
the
MMSE
and
the
Center
for
Epidemiologic
Studies-Depression
(CES-D)
scale
Dementia
was
diagnosed
by
clinical
examination
Linear
regression
models
were
constructed
The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
SML
were
determined
with
a
diagnosis
of
dementia
being
the
gold
standard
SML
was
correlated
with
MMSE
scores
even
after
adjusting
for
age
sex
education
and
depressive
symptoms
The
sensitivity
of
SML
was
058
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
045
071)
and
the
specificity
was
076
(95%
CI
074
078)
for
dementia
SML
is
correlated
with
MMSE
score
However
SML
is
neither
sensitive
nor
specific
for
dementia
