Treatment
of
antibiotic-associated
Clostridium
difficile
colitis
with
oral
vancomycin
comparison
of
two
dosage
regimens
Abstract
Text
High-dose
(500
mg
orally
four
times
daily)
vancomycin
is
considered
by
many
investigators
to
be
the
most
effective
treatment
for
antibiotic-associated
Clostridium
difficile
colitis
However
a
lower
dosage
of
125
or
150
mg
given
three
or
four
times
a
day
has
become
popular
has
been
shown
to
be
effective
and
is
less
expensive
than
the
high-dose
regimen
We
therefore
decided
to
compare
two
vancomycin
dosage
regimens
in
a
randomized
trial
The
study
involved
46
hospitalized
patients
with
serious
underlying
diseases
complicated
by
C
difficile
diarrhea
or
colitis
Patients
were
assigned
(according
to
a
table
of
random
numbers)
to
treatment
with
either
125
or
500
mg
of
vancomycin
orally
four
times
daily
for
an
average
of
10
days
No
significant
differences
in
measurable
responses
to
the
two
regimens
were
noted
There
were
no
treatment
failures
The
mean
duration
of
diarrhea
after
initiation
of
therapy
was
about
four
days
and
almost
all
patients
had
no
diarrhea
after
one
week
The
organism
continued
to
be
demonstrated
in
the
stools
of
about
50
percent
of
patients
for
the
first
few
weeks
after
completion
of
therapy
and
nine
(20
percent)
patients
developed
a
recurrence
of
their
diarrheal
illness
Vancomycin
was
well
tolerated
by
all
patients
Since
the
dose
of
125
mg
appeared
to
be
as
effective
as
the
500-mg
dose
which
is
more
expensive
the
125-mg
dose
is
preferred
when
vancomycin
is
used
in
treatment
of
this
disease
unless
the
patient
is
critically
ill
