Beta-blocker
therapy
and
symptoms
of
depression
fatigue
and
sexual
dysfunction
Abstract
Text
beta-Blocker
therapy
remains
substantially
underused
in
cardiac
patients
despite
its
proven
mortality
benefits
Reluctance
to
prescribe
these
agents
may
derive
from
concerns
about
their
association
with
symptoms
of
depression
fatigue
and
sexual
dysfunction
To
determine
the
association
of
beta-blockers
with
depressive
symptoms
fatigue
and
sexual
dysfunction
by
performing
a
quantitative
review
of
randomized
trials
that
tested
beta-blockers
in
myocardial
infarction
heart
failure
and
hypertension
Randomized
trials
of
beta-blockers
used
in
the
treatment
of
myocardial
infarction
heart
failure
or
hypertension
were
identified
by
searching
the
MEDLINE
database
for
English-language
articles
(1966-2001)
In
addition
we
searched
the
reference
lists
of
previously
published
trials
and
reviews
of
beta-blockers
for
additional
studies
Criteria
for
inclusion
of
trials
in
the
review
were
random
allocation
of
study
treatments
placebo
control
noncrossover
design
enrollment
of
at
least
100
patients
and
a
minimum
of
6
months
of
follow-up
The
initial
search
produced
475
articles
42
of
which
met
these
criteria
Fifteen
of
these
trials
reported
on
depressive
symptoms
fatigue
or
sexual
dysfunction
and
were
selected
for
inclusion
For
each
trial
1
author
abstracted
the
frequency
of
adverse
events
in
the
beta-blocker
and
placebo
groups
and
the
numbers
of
patients
randomized
to
the
treatment
groups
Two
other
authors
verified
the
counts
of
events
and
all
authors
adjudicated
any
discrepancies
Two
different
types
of
information
on
adverse
events
were
abstracted
patient-reported
symptoms
and
withdrawal
of
therapy
due
to
a
specified
symptom
We
categorized
the
tested
beta-blockers
by
generation
(early
vs
late)
and
lipid
solubility
(high
vs
low
to
moderate)
The
15
trials
involved
more
than
35000
subjects
beta-Blocker
therapy
was
not
associated
with
a
significant
absolute
annual
increase
in
risk
of
reported
depressive
symptoms
(6
per
1000
patients
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
-7
to
19)
beta-Blockers
were
associated
with
a
small
significant
annual
increase
in
risk
of
reported
fatigue
(18
per
1000
patients
95%
CI
5-30)
equivalent
to
1
additional
report
of
fatigue
for
every
57
patients
treated
per
year
with
beta-blockers
beta-Blockers
were
also
associated
with
a
small
significant
annual
increase
in
risk
of
reported
sexual
dysfunction
(5
per
1000
patients
95%
CI
2-8)
equivalent
to
one
additional
report
for
every
199
patients
treated
per
year
None
of
the
risks
of
adverse
effects
differed
significantly
by
degree
of
beta-blocker
lipid
solubility
The
risk
associated
with
reported
fatigue
was
significantly
higher
for
early-generation
than
for
late-generation
beta-blockers
(P
=04)
The
conventional
wisdom
that
beta-blocker
therapy
is
associated
with
substantial
risks
of
depressive
symptoms
fatigue
and
sexual
dysfunction
is
not
supported
by
data
from
clinical
trials
There
is
no
significant
increased
risk
of
depressive
symptoms
and
only
small
increased
risks
of
fatigue
and
sexual
dysfunction
The
risks
of
these
adverse
effects
should
be
put
in
the
context
of
the
documented
benefits
of
these
medications
