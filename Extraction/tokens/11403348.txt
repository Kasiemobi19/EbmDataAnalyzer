Independent
predictors

hypertension
Abstract
Text
Hypertension
guidelines
recommend
24
h
ambulatory
blood
pressure
(ABP)
monitoring
in
hypertensive
subjects
with
suspected
isolated
clinic
hypertension
(ICH)
However
the
pre-test
probability
of
ICH
based
on
the
distribution
of
its
independent
predictors
has
not
yet
been
estimated
in
hypertensive
subjects
with
mildly
elevated
blood
pressure
To
ascertain
the
independent
predictors
of
ICH
in
mildly
hypertensive
subjects
In
the
setting
of
the
HARVEST-PIUMA
collaboration
we
studied
1564
subjects
with
hypertension
stage
I
At
entry
all
subjects
were
untreated
and
all
underwent
ABP
monitoring
and
echocardiography
Diabetes
hypertension
grade
>
I
renal
failure
or
previous
cardiovascular
morbid
events
were
exclusion
criteria
Clinic
BP
was
143/92
mmHg
(SD
9/5)
and
24
h
ABP
was
128/81
mmHg
(SD
10/8)
Prevalence
of
ICH
(daytime
ABP
<
130
mmHg
systolic
and
80
mmHg
diastolic)
was
104%
In
a
multivariate
logistic
regression
analysis
sex
(P
=
0002)
smoking
(P
=
0038)
and
clinic
diastolic
BP
(P
=
00002)
were
the
sole
independent
predictors
of
ICH
according
to
the
following
equation
Y
=
26438
+
05128
x
sex
(0
=
men
1
=
women)
+
04543
x
current
smoking
(0
=
yes
1
=
no)
-
00531
x
clinic
diastolic
BP
(mmHg)
and
P
(probability
of
ICH)
=
exp(Y)/[1
+
(exp(Y)]
Left
ventricular
(LV)
mass
at
echocardiography
was
a
further
independent
predictor
(P
=
0002)
of
ICH
according
to
the
following
equation
Y=
34343
+
04603
x
sex
+
05989
x
current
smoking
-
00482
x
clinic
diastolic
BP
-
00312
x
LV
mass
[g/height
(m)27]
LV
mass
was
greater
(P
<
001)
in
the
group
with
ambulatory
hypertension
[423
g/height
(m)27]
than
in
that
with
ICH
[392
g/height
(m)27]
and
not
dissimilar
between
the
ICH
group
and
a
control
group
of
370
healthy
normotensive
subjects
[381
g/height
(m)27]
In
untreated
subjects
with
stage
I
hypertension
ICH
is
most
frequent
among
women
nonsmokers
and
subjects
with
low
clinic
BP
and
smaller
LV
mass
These
findings
allow
identification
of
subjects
with
indication
to
ABP
monitoring
because
of
suspected
ICH
