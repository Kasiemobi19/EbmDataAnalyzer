Meta-analysis

risedronate

postmenopausal
osteoporosis
Abstract
Text
To
review
the
effect
of
risedronate
on
bone
density
and
fractures
in
postmenopausal
women
We
searched
MEDLINE
from
1966
to
the
end
of
2000
and
examined
citations
of
relevant
articles
and
the
proceedings
of
international
osteoporosis
meetings
We
included
eight
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
of
postmenopausal
women
receiving
risedronate
or
placebo
with
a
follow-up
of
at
least
one
year
and
providing
data
on
bone
density
or
fracture
rate
For
each
trial
two
independent
reviewers
assessed
the
methodological
quality
and
abstracted
data
The
major
methodological
limitation
of
the
trials
was
the
loss
to
follow-up
which
was
over
20%
in
most
trials
and
over
35%
in
the
largest
study
However
the
magnitude
of
the
treatment
effect
was
unrelated
to
loss
to
follow-up
and
in
one
of
the
largest
trials
more
high-risk
patients
were
lost
to
follow-up
in
the
control
than
in
the
treatment
group
The
pooled
relative
risk
(RR)
for
vertebral
fractures
in
women
given
25
mg
or
more
of
risedronate
was
064
[95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
054
077]
The
pooled
RR
of
nonvertebral
fractures
in
patients
given
25
mg
or
more
of
risedronate
was
073
(95%
CI
061
087)
Risedronate
produced
positive
effects
on
the
percentage
change
in
bone
density
of
the
lumbar
spine
combined
forearm
and
femoral
neck
that
were
generally
larger
with
the
5-mg
daily
dose
than
with
cyclical
administration
or
the
25-mg
dose
The
pooled
estimate
of
the
difference
in
percentage
change
between
5
mg
risedronate
and
placebo
after
the
final
year
of
treatment
(15-3
yr)
was
454%
(95%
CI
412
497)
for
the
lumbar
spine
and
275%
(95%
CI
232
317)
at
the
femoral
neck
Risedronate
substantially
reduces
the
risk
of
both
vertebral
and
nonvertebral
fractures
This
fracture
reduction
is
accompanied
by
an
increase
in
bone
density
of
the
lumbar
spine
and
femoral
neck
in
both
early
postmenopausal
women
and
those
with
established
osteoporosis
