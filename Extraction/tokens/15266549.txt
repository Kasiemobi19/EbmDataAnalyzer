Title
Effect
of
longer-term
modest
salt
reduction
on
blood
pressure
Abstract
Text
Many
randomised
trials
assessing
the
effect
of
salt
reduction
on
blood
pressure
show
reduction
in
blood
pressure
in
individuals
with
high
blood
pressure
However
there
is
controversy
about
the
magnitude
and
the
clinical
significance
of
the
fall
in
blood
pressure
in
individuals
with
normal
blood
pressure
Several
meta-analyses
of
randomised
salt
reduction
trials
have
been
published
in
the
last
few
years
However
most
of
these
included
trials
of
very
short
duration
(eg
5
days)
and
included
trials
with
salt
loading
followed
by
salt
deprivation
(eg
from
20
to
1
g/day)
over
only
a
few
days
These
short-term
experiments
are
not
appropriate
to
inform
public
health
policy
which
is
for
a
modest
reduction
in
salt
intake
over
a
prolonged
period
of
time
A
meta-analysis
by
Hooper
et
al
is
an
important
attempt
to
look
at
whether
advice
to
achieve
a
long-term
salt
reduction
(ie
more
than
6
months)
in
randomised
trials
causes
a
fall
in
blood
pressure
However
most
trials
included
in
this
meta-analysis
achieved
a
small
reduction
in
salt
intake
on
average
salt
intake
was
reduced
by
2
g/day
It
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
this
analysis
showed
a
small
fall
in
blood
pressure
and
that
a
dose-response
to
salt
reduction
was
not
demonstrable
To
assess
the
effect
of
the
currently
recommended
modest
reduction
in
salt
intake
(WHO
2003
SACN
2003
Whelton
2002)
on
blood
pressure
in
individuals
with
normal
and
elevated
blood
pressure
To
assess
whether
the
magnitude
of
the
reduction
in
blood
pressure
is
dependent
on
the
magnitude
of
the
reduction
in
salt
intake
We
searched
MEDLINE

Cochrane
library
CINAHL
and

list
of
original
and

articles
We
included
randomised
trials
with
a
modest
reduction
in
salt
intake
and
a
duration
of
4
or
more
weeks
Data
were
extracted
independently
by
two
persons
Mean
effect
sizes
were
calculated
using
both
fixed
and
random
effect
models
using

Weighted
linear
regression
was
used
to
examine
the
relationship
between
the
change
in
urinary
sodium
and
the
change
in
blood
pressure
We
used
funnel
plots
to
detect
publication
and
other
biases
in
the
meta-analysis
Seventeen
trials
in
individuals
with
elevated
blood
pressure
(n=734)
and
11
trials
in
individuals
with
normal
blood
pressure
(n=2220)
were
included
In
individuals
with
elevated
blood
pressure
the
median
reduction
in
24-h
urinary
sodium
excretion
was
78
mmol
(46
g/day
of
salt)
the
mean
reduction
in
systolic
blood
pressure
was
-497
mmHg
(95%CI-576
to
-418)
and
the
mean
reduction
in
diastolic
blood
pressure
was
-274
mmHg
(95%
CI-322
to
-226)
In
individuals
with
normal
blood
pressure
the
median
reduction
in
24-h
urinary
sodium
excretion
was
74
mmol
(44
g/day
of
salt)
the
mean
reduction
in
systolic
blood
pressure
was
-203
mmHg
(95%
CI
-256
to
-150)
mmHg
and
the
mean
reduction
in
diastolic
blood
pressure
was
-099
mmHg
(-140
to
-057)
Weighted
linear
regression
analyses
showed
a
correlation
between
the
reduction
in
urinary
sodium
and
the
reduction
in
blood
pressure
Our
meta-analysis
demonstrates
that
a
modest
reduction
in
salt
intake
for
a
duration
of
4
or
more
weeks
has
a
significant
and
from
a
population
viewpoint
important
effect
on
blood
pressure
in
both
individuals
with
normal
and
elevated
blood
pressure
These
results
support
other
evidence
suggesting
that
a
modest
and
long-term
reduction
in
population
salt
intake
could
reduce
strokes
heart
attacks
and
heart
failure
Furthermore
our
meta-analysis
demonstrates
a
correlation
between
the
magnitude
of
salt
reduction
and
the
magnitude
of
blood
pressure
reduction
Within
the
daily
intake
range
of
3
to
12
g/day
the
lower
the
salt
intake
achieved
the
lower
the
blood
pressure
