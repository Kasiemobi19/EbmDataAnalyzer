Title
Acupuncture
for
chronic
asthma
Abstract
Text
Acupuncture
has
traditionally
been
used
to
treat
asthma
in
China
and
is
used
increasingly
for
this
purpose
internationally
The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
acupuncture
for
the
treatment
of
asthma
or
asthma-like
symptoms
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Airways
Group
trials
register
(searched
August
2003)
the
Cochrane
Complementary
Medicine
Field
trials
register
the
Alternative
Medicine
Database
(August
2003)
and
reference
lists
of
articles
We
also
contacted
trialists
and
researchers
in
the
field
of
complementary
and
alternative
medical
research
Randomised
and
possibly
randomised
trials
using
needle
acupuncture
or
other
forms
of
stimulation
of
acupuncture
Any
form
of
control
treatment
was
considered
(no
treatment
in
addition
to
conventional
asthma
treatment
sham
or
placebo
interventions
active
comparator
interventions)
Studies
were
included
provided
outcome
was
assessed
at
one
week
or
more
At
least
two
reviewers
independently
assessed
trial
quality
A
reviewer
experienced
in
acupuncture
assessed
the
adequacy
of
the
active
and
sham
acupunctures
used
in
the
studies
Study
authors
were
contacted
for
missing
information
Eleven
studies
met
the
inclusion
criteria
with
324
participants
Trial
reporting
was
poor
and
trial
quality
was
deemed
inadequate
to
generalise
findings
There
was
variation
in
the
type
of
active
and
sham
acupunctures
the
outcomes
measured
and
time-points
presented
The
points
used
in
the
sham
arm
of
some
studies
are
used
for
the
treatment
of
asthma
according
to
traditional
Chinese
medicine
Two
studies
used
individualised
treatment
strategies
and
one
study
used
a
combination
strategy
of
formula
acupuncture
with
the
addition
of
individualised
points
No
statistically
significant
or
clinically
relevant
effects
were
found
for
acupuncture
compared
to
sham
acupuncture
Data
from
two
small
studies
were
pooled
for

There
is
not
enough
evidence
to
make
recommendations
about
the
value
of
acupuncture
in
asthma
treatment
Further
research
needs
to
consider
the
complexities
and
different
types
of
acupuncture
