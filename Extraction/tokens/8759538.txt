Incidental
paranasal
sinus
inflammatory
changes
in
a
British
population
Abstract
Text
A
retrospective
study
was
carried
out
to
determine
the
prevalence
of
abnormality
in
the
paranasal
sinuses
in
a
British
population
having
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI)
scans
for
neurological
signs
and
symptoms
The
T2-weighted
scans
of
130
patients
were
studied
Abnormalities
in
the
paranasal
sinuses
show
as
high
signal
on
the
T2-weighted
scans
and
thus
are
clearly
seen
Abnormalities
included
mucosal
thickening
fluid
levels
sinus
opacification
and
retention
cysts/polyps
Of
the
patients
studied
492
per
cent
showed
one
or
more
abnormality
Mucosal
thickening
was
the
most
common
abnormality
noted
and
the
ethmoid
sinuses
the
most
commonly
affected
