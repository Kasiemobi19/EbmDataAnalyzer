Title
Screening
for
amblyopia
in
childhood
Abstract
Text
Amblyopia
is
a
reversible
deficit
of
vision
that
has
to
be
treated
within
the
sensitive
period
for
visual
development
Screening
programmes
have
been
set
up
to
detect
this
largely
asymptomatic
condition
and
refer
children
for
treatment
while
an
improvement
in
vision
is
still
possible
The
value
of
such
programmes
and
the
optimum
protocol
for
administering
them
remain
controversial
The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
vision
screening
in
reducing
the
prevalence
of
amblyopia
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
which
contains
the
Cochrane
Eyes
and
Vision
Group
Trials
Register
on
The

MEDLINE
(1966

week

and
EMBASE
(1980
to
2005

No
language
restrictions
were
placed
on
these
searches
No
handsearching
was
done
We
planned
to
analyse
data
from
randomised
controlled
trials
and
cluster-randomised
trials
comparing
the
prevalence
of
amblyopia
in
screened
versus
unscreened
populations
Two
authors
independently
assessed
study
abstracts
identified
by
the
electronic
searches
Full
text
copies
of
appropriate
studies
were
obtained
and
where
necessary
authors
were
contacted
No
data
were
available
for
analysis
and
no
meta-analysis
was
performed
Despite
the
large
amount
of
literature
available
regarding
vision
screening
no
trials
designed
to
compare
the
prevalence
of
amblyopia
in
screened
versus
unscreened
populations
were
found
Data
currently
under
preparation
may
be
available
for
updates
to
the
review
The
lack
of
data
from
randomised
controlled
trials
makes
it
difficult
to
analyse
the
impact
of
existing
screening
programmes
on
the
prevalence
of
amblyopia
The
absence
of
such
evidence
cannot
be
taken
to
mean
that
vision
screening
is
not
beneficial
simply
that
this
intervention
has
not
yet
been
tested
in
robust
trials
To
facilitate
such
trials
normative
data
on
age-appropriate
vision
tests
need
to
be
available
and
a
consensus
reached
regarding
the
definition
of
amblyopia
In
addition
the
consequences
of
living
with
untreated
amblyopia
have
yet
to
be
quantified
and
a
cost-benefit
analysis
carried
out
