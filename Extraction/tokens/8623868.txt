Title
Pregnancy
outcomes
in
the
Diabetes
Control
and
Complications
Trial
Abstract
Text
Our
purpose
was
to
examine
the
maternal
and
fetal
outcomes
of
the
180
women
with
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
who
became
pregnant
during
the
Diabetes
Control
and
Complications
Trial
The
Diabetes
Control
and
Complications
Trial
was
a
multicenter
controlled
clinical
trial
that
compared
intensive
with
conventional
therapy
in
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
Intensive
therapy
with
the
aim
of
achieving
normal
glycemic
control
was
initiated
in
women
originally
assigned
to
conventional
therapy
who
actively
sought
to
become
pregnant
or
who
became
pregnant
A
total
of
180
women
completed
270
pregnancies
between
1983
and
1993
with
191
total
live
births
The
mean
glycosylated
hemoglobin
level
was
significantly
different
between
the
treatment
groups
at
conception
(74%
+/-
13%
in
intensive
vs
81%
+/-
17%
in
conventional
therapy
p
=
00001)
but
was
similar
during
gestation
(66%
+/-
08%
and
66%
+/-
13%)
Nine
congenital
malformations
were
identified
(47%)
eight
of
which
occurred
in
women
originally
assigned
to
conventional
therapy
(p
=
006)
There
were
32
spontaneous
abortions
133%
in
the
intensive
and
104%
in
the
women
originally
assigned
to
conventional
treatment
(not
significant)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
outcome
between
the
women
with
conventional
treatment
who
initiated
intensive
therapy
preconception
and
those
who
began
it
after
conception
Timely
institution
of
intensive
therapy
is
associated
with
rates
of
spontaneous
abortion
and
congenital
malformation
similar
to
those
in
the
nondiabetic
population
