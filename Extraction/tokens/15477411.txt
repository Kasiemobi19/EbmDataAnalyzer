There
is

evidence
for
an
increase

acute

syndromes
after
short-term

discontinuation
of
statins
in

patients
Abstract
Text
For
a
variety
of
reasons
many
patients
abruptly
discontinue
statin
therapy
The
present
analysis
was
conducted
to
determine
whether
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
outcomes
increases
after
withdrawal
of
statin
therapy
in
a
stable
cardiac
population
In
the
Treating
to
New
Target
(TNT)
study
2
doses
of
atorvastatin
(10
and
80
mg
once
daily)
are
being
used
in
a
double-blind
parallel-group
design
Of
the
18468
patients
screened
for
study
participation
16619
entered
a
dietary
lead-in/drug-washout
period
and
of
these
15432
eligible
participants
began
treatment
with
atorvastatin
10
mg/d
on
an
open-label
basis
Of
the
subjects
who
entered
the
dietary
lead-in/drug-washout
period
57%
were
receiving
prior
statin
therapy
During
the
6-week
drug-washout
period
there
were
24
primary
events
(defined
as
coronary
heart
disease
death
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
resuscitated
cardiac
arrest
and
fatal
or
nonfatal
stroke)
throughout
the
subsequent
8-week
open-label
period
there
were
31
primary
events
This
equated
to
monthly
Kaplan-Meier
event
rates
of
020%
during
washout
and
026%
in
the
open-label
phase
Event
rates
were
therefore
similar
during
the
2
phases
The
present
analysis
demonstrates
that
short-term
discontinuation
of
statin
therapy
in
stable
cardiac
patients
apparently
does
not
lead
to
a
clinically
important
increased
risk
of
acute
coronary
syndromes
