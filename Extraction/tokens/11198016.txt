Outbreak

review
Large
tertiary
acute-care
hospital
A
patient
with
unrecognized
Norwegian
(crusted)
scabies
was
admitted
to
the
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome
(AIDS)
service
of
a
940-bed
acute-care
hospital
Over
4
months
773
healthcare
workers
(HCWs)
and
204
patients
were
exposed
to
scabies
Of
the
exposed
HCWs
147
(19%)
worked
on
the
AIDS
service
Risk
factors
for
being
infested
with
scabies
among
HCWs
included
working
on
the
AIDS
service
(odds
ratio
[OR]
53
95%
confidence
interval
[CI95]
217-1315)
and
being
a
nurse
physical
therapist
or
HCW
with
extensive
physical
contact
with
infected
patients
(OR
45
CI95
126-1745)
Aggressive
infection
control
precautions
beyond
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
barrier
and
isolation
recommendations
were
instituted
including
the
following
(1)
early
identification
of
infected
patients
(2)
prophylactic
treatment
with
topical
applications
for
all
exposed
HCWs
(3)
use
of
two
treatments
1
week
apart
for
all
cases
of
Norwegian
scabies
(4)
maintaining
isolation
for
8
days
and
barrier
precautions
for
24
hours
after
completing
second
treatment
for
a
diagnosis
of
Norwegian
scabies
and
(5)
oral
ivermectin
for
treatment
of
patients
who
failed
conventional
therapy
HCWs
with
the
most
patient
contact
are
at
highest
risk
of
acquiring
scabies
Because
HCWs
who
used
traditionally
accepted
barriers
while
caring
for
patients
with
Norwegian
scabies
continued
to
develop
scabies
we
found
additional
measures
were
required
in
the
acute-care
hospital
HCWs
with
skin
exposure
to
patients
with
scabies
should
receive
prophylactic
treatment
We
recommend
(1)
using
heightened
barrier
precautions
for
care
of
patients
with
scabies
and
(2)
extending
the
isolation
period
for
8
days
or
24
hours
after
the
second
treatment
with
a
scabicide
for
those
patients
with
Norwegian
scabies
Oral
ivermectin
was
well
tolerated
for
treating
patients
and
HCWs
who
failed
conventional
treatment
Finally
we
developed
a
surveillance
system
that
provides
a
"barometric
measure"
of
the
infection
rate
in
the
community
If
scabies
increases
in
the
community
a
tiered
triage
system
is
activated
to
protect
against
transmission
among
HCWs
or
hospital
patients
