Efficacy
of
fluvoxamine
in
the
treatment
of
major
depression
with
comorbid
anxiety
disorders
Abstract
Text
Major
depression
with
comorbid
anxiety
disorder
is
associated
with
poor
antidepressant
outcome
compared
with
major
depression
without
comorbid
anxiety
disorder
The
purpose
of
our
study
was
to
assess
changes
in
depressive
symptoms
and
anxiety
levels
in
outpatients
with
major
depression
with
comorbid
anxiety
disorder
following
12
weeks
of
open
treatment
with
fluvoxamine
We
enrolled
30
outpatients
(mean
+/-
SD
age
=
394
+/-
113
years
16
women
and
14
men)
with
DSM-IV
major
depressive
disorder
accompanied
by
one
or
more
current
comorbid
DSM-IV
anxiety
disorders
in
our
study
Patients
were
treated
openly
with
fluvoxamine
initiated
at
50
mg/day
with
an
upward
titration
to
a
maximum
of
200
mg/day
(mean
+/-
SD
dose
=
143
+/-
45
mg/day)
Efficacy
assessments
included
the
17-item
Hamilton
Rating
Scale
for
Depression
(HAM-D-17)
and
Clinical
Global
Impressions-Severity
of
Illness
(CGI-S)
and
Improvement
(CGI-I)
scales
for
both
depression
and
anxiety
Intent-to-treat
analysis
was
used
to
assess
outcome
The
mean
+/-
SD
number
of
comorbid
anxiety
disorders
per
patient
was
21
+/-
11
Following
fluvoxamine
treatment
the
mean
+/-
SD
HAM-D-17
score
dropped
from
202
+/-
33
to
1
10
+/-
70
(p
<
0001)
The
mean
+/-
SD
depression
CGI-S
score
dropped
from
40
+/-
06
to
24
+/-
11
(p
<
0001)
and
the
mean
+/-
SD
anxiety
CGI-S
score
decreased
from
41
+/-
08
to
25
+/-
12
(p
<
0001)
Eighteen
(60%)
of
the
30
patients
had
CGI-I
scores
<
or
=
2
for
both
anxiety
and
depression
at
endpoint
with
53%
showing
a
>
or
=
50%
reduction
in
HAM-D-17
scores
at
endpoint
Although
preliminary
our
findings
suggest
that
fluvoxamine
is
effective
in
treating
outpatients
with
major
depression
with
comorbid
anxiety
disorder
having
a
significant
effect
on
both
depression
and
anxiety
symptoms
Further
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trials
are
needed
in
a
larger
sample
to
confirm
our
findings
