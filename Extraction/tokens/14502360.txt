Title
Diet
plus
insulin
compared
to
diet
alone
in
the
treatment
of
gestational
diabetes
mellitus
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
Fetuses
of
mothers
with
gestational
diabetes
mellitus
are
at
increased
risk
to
develop
perinatal
complications
mainly
due
to
macrosomia
However
in
view
of
the
marked
heterogeneity
of
this
disease
it
seems
difficult
to
set
guidelines
for
diagnosis
and
treatment
This
complicates
the
choice
of
assigning
patients
either
to
diet
or
to
insulin
therapy
Also
of
concern
is
how
much
benefit
could
be
expected
from
insulin
therapy
in
preventing
fetal
complications
in
these
patients
In
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
assessing
the
efficacy
of
insulin
in
preventing
macrosomia
in
fetuses
of
mothers
with
gestational
diabetes
we
found
six
randomized
controlled
trials
comparing
diet
alone
to
diet
plus
insulin
The
studies
included
a
total
of
1281
patients
(644
in
the
diet
plus
insulin
group
and
637
in
the
diet
group)
with
marked
differences
among
trials
concerning
diagnostic
criteria
randomization
process
and
treatment
goals
Meta-analysis
of
the
data
resulted
in
a
risk
difference
of
-0098
(95%CI
-0168
to
-0028)
and
a
number-necessary-to-treat
of
11
(95%CI
6
to
36)
which
means
that
it
is
necessary
to
treat
11
patients
with
insulin
to
prevent
one
case
of
macrosomia
This
indicates
a
potential
benefit
of
insulin
but
not
significantly
enough
to
set
treatment
guidelines
Because
of
the
heterogeneous
evidence
available
in
the
literature
about
this
matter
we
conclude
that
larger
trials
addressing
the
efficacy
of
these
two
therapeutic
modalities
in
preventing
macrosomia
are
warranted
