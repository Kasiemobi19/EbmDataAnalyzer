Therapeutic
selective

Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
outcomes
resulting
from
the
use
of
fluoroscopically
guided
therapeutic
selective
nerve
root
block
(SNRB)
in
the
nonsurgical
treatment
of
atraumatic
cervical
spondylotic
radicular
pain
Retrospective
study
with
independent
clinical
review
Twenty
subjects
(10
men
10
women)
with
mean
age
566
years
Each
patient
met
specific
physical
examination
radiographic
and
electrodiagnostic
criteria
to
confirm
a
level
of
cervical
involvement
Those
patients
whose
root
level
remained
indeterminate
were
required
to
demonstrate
a
positive
response
to
a
fluoroscopically
guided
diagnostic
SNRB
prior
to
the
initiation
of
treatment
Therapeutic
injections
were
administered
in
conjunction
with
physical
therapy
Data
collection
and
analysis
were
performed
by
an
independent
clinical
reviewer
Pain
score
work
status
medication
usage
and
patient
satisfaction
Twenty
patients
with
an
average
symptom
duration
of
58
months
were
included
An
average
of
22
therapeutic
injections
was
administered
Follow-up
data
collection
transpired
at
an
average
of
212
months
following
discharge
from
treatment
A
significant
reduction
(p
=
001)
in
pain
score
was
observed
at
the
time
of
follow-up
Medication
usage
was
also
significantly
improved
(p
=
005)
at
the
time
of
follow-up
An
overall
good
or
excellent
result
was
observed
in
60%
Thirty
percent
of
patients
required
surgery
Younger
patients
were
more
likely
(p
=
0047)
to
report
the
highest
patient
satisfaction
rating
following
treatment
This
study
suggests
that
fluoroscopically
guided
therapeutic
SNRB
is
a
clinically
effective
intervention
in
the
treatment
of
atraumatic
cervical
spondylotic
radicular
pain
