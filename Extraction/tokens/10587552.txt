Osteopenia
in
young
hypogonadal
women
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
receiving
chronic
steroid
therapy
a
randomized
controlled
trial
comparing
calcitriol
and
hormonal

Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
calcitriol
and
hormonal
replacement
therapy
(HRT)
in
the
treatment
of
steroid-induced
osteoporosis
in
hypogonadal
women
We
studied
28
young
patients
(aged
37
+/-
6
yr)
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(SLE)
on
chronic
steroid
therapy
for
130
+/-
22
months
and
requiring
more
than
10
mg/day
prednisone
They
were
amenorrhoeic
for
more
than
2
yr
with
proven
ovarian
failure
All
had
osteopenia
with
a
T
score
at
L2-4
of
less
than
-1
They
were
randomized
to
receive
HRT
(conjugated
oestrogen
0625
mg
daily
from
day
1
to
day
21
plus
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
5
mg
daily
days
10-21)
or
calcitriol
05
microg
daily
All
received
calcium
carbonate
1
g/day
There
were
no
differences
in
the
baseline
demographic
bone
mineral
density
(BMD)
and
biochemical
data
between
the
two
groups
Lumbar
spine
BMD
increased
by
20
+/-
04%
after
2
yr
with
HRT
(P<005)
but
reduced
by
174
+/-
04%
(P<005)
with
calcitriol
treatment
No
change
was
seen
at
the
distal
one-third
radius
with
HRT
treatment
but
significant
bone
loss
(23
+/-
14%
P<002)
was
observed
with
calcitriol
therapy
BMD
at
the
hip
did
not
change
in
both
groups
Comparing
both
treatment
groups
significant
differences
in
the
BMD
at
the
spine
(P<003)
and
radius
(P<005)
were
seen
at
the
end
of
2
yr
The
changes
in
urinary
n-telopeptide
excretion
but
not
serum
osteocalcin
at
6
months
and
12
months
were
inversely
correlated
with
the
changes
in
lumbar
spine
BMD
at
24
months
HRT
did
not
cause
an
adverse
effect
on
SLE
disease
activity
HRT
but
not
calcitriol
could
prevent
bone
loss
in
young
hypogonadal
women
on
chronic
steroid
therapy
