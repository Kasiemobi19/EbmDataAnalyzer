Efficacy
of
epidural
steroid
injections
for
low-back
pain
and
sciatica
a
systematic
review
of
randomized
clinical
trials
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
the
study
was
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
epidural
steroid
injections
for
low-back
pain
Data
was
obtained
using
computer-aided
search
of
published
randomized
clinical
trials
and
assessment
of
the
methods
of
the
studies
Twelve
randomized
clinical
trials
evaluating
epidural
steroid
injections
were
identified
Data
was
extracted
based
on
scores
for
quality
of
the
methods
using
4
categories
(study
population
interventions
effect
measurement
and
data
presentation
and
analysis)
and
the
conclusion
of
the
author(s)
with
regard
to
the
efficacy
of
epidural
steroid
injections
Method
scores
of
the
trials
ranged
from
17
to
72
points
(maximum
100
points)
Eight
trials
showed
method
scores
of
50
points
or
more
Of
the
4
best
studies
(>
60
points)
2
reported
positive
outcomes
and
2
reported
negative
results
Overall
6
studies
indicated
that
the
epidural
steroid
injection
was
more
effective
than
the
reference
treatment
and
6
reported
it
to
be
no
better
or
worse
than
the
reference
treatment
There
appeared
to
be
no
relationship
between
the
methodological
quality
of
the
trials
and
reported
outcomes
In
conclusion
there
are
flaws
in
the
design
of
most
studies
The
best
studies
showed
inconsistent
results
of
epidural
steroid
injections
The
efficacy
of
epidural
steroid
injections
has
not
been
established
The
benefits
of
epidural
steroid
injections
if
any
seem
to
be
of
short
duration
only
Future
research
efforts
are
warranted
but
more
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
methods
of
the
trials
