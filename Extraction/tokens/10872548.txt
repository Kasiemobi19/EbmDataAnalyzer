Clinical
value
of
microalbuminuria
in
hypertension
Abstract
Text
Microalbuminuria
(MA)
is
a
well
recognized
marker
of
cardiovascular
complications
in
hypertension
but
whether
MA
can
predict
adverse
outcome
in
this
clinical
condition
is
still
a
subject
for
debate
The
fact
that
in
hypertensive
cohorts
those
patients
who
showed
an
increase
in
albumin
excretion
rate
also
manifested
an
increased
incidence
of
morbid
events
indicates
that
the
presence
of
MA
in
hypertension
may
carry
an
increased
cardiovascular
risk
However
the
prognostic
significance
of
MA
remains
controversial
because
no
results
of
prospective
studies
performed
in
hypertensive
subjects
without
diabetes
mellitus
are
available
Several
factors
can
affect
the
prevalence
of
MA
in
hypertension
including
severity
of
the
disease
selection
procedures
concomitant
risk
factors
degree
of
obesity
age
and
sex
distribution
This
accounts
for
the
large
differences
in
the
prevalence
of
MA
that
can
be
found
in
the
literature
with
prevalence
rates
going
from
a
low
of
47%
to
a
high
of
40%
There
is
still
conflict
over
whether
MA
in
hypertension
is
due
to
increased
intraglomerular
pressure
or
to
glomerular
damage
The
data
from
the
literature
suggest
that
in
subjects
with
mild
hypertension
the
main
determinant
of
albumin
excretion
rate
is
the
haemodynamic
load
In
subjects
with
more
severe
hypertension
and
hypertensive
complications
the
augmented
urinary
albumin
leak
is
probably
the
consequence
of
a
systemic
microvascular
disturbance
which
involves
the
glomeruli
In
this
respect
the
insulin
resistance
state
often
associated
to
high
blood
pressure
appears
as
one
of
the
main
pathogenetic
factors
Whether
management
of
hypertensive
populations
may
be
improved
by
monitoring
of
albumin
excretion
rate
and
whether
antihypertensive
drugs
which
are
more
effective
in
decreasing
urinary
albumin
can
be
more
beneficial
in
patients
with
MA
remains
to
be
determined
