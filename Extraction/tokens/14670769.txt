Factors
relating
to
the
infant's
last
sleep
environment
in
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
Abstract
Text
To
identify
risk
factors
for
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(SIDS)
in
the
sleeping
environment
of
Irish
infants
A
five
year
population
based
case-control
study
with
parental
interviews
conducted
for
each
case
and
three
controls
matched
for
age
place
of
birth
and
last
sleep
period
A
total
of
203
SIDS
cases
and
622
control
infants
born
1994-98
were
studied
In
a
multivariate
analysis
co-sleeping
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
SIDS
both
as
a
usual
practice
(adjusted
OR
431
95%
CI
107
to
1737)
and
during
the
last
sleep
period
(adjusted
OR
1647
95%
CI
373
to
7275)
The
associated
risk
was
dependent
on
maternal
smoking
(OR
2184
95%
CI
227
to
20989)
and
was
not
significant
for
infants
who
were
>
or
=20
weeks
of
age
(OR
263
95%
CI
049
to
7010)
or
placed
back
in
their
own
cot/bed
to
sleep
(OR
107
95%
CI
021
to
541)
The
use
of
pillows
duvets
and
bedding
with
tog
value
>
or
=10
were
not
significant
risk
factors
when
adjusted
for
the
effects
of
confounding
variables
including
maternal
smoking
and
social
disadvantage
However
the
prone
sleeping
position
remains
a
significant
SIDS
risk
factor
and
among
infants
using
soothers
the
absence
of
soother
use
during
the
last
sleep
period
also
significantly
increased
the
SIDS
risk
(OR
583
CI
237
to
1436)
Co-sleeping
should
be
avoided
in
infants
who
are
<20
weeks
of
age
or
whose
mothers
smoked
during
pregnancy
The
prone
position
remains
a
factor
in
some
SIDS
deaths
and
the
relation
between
soother
use
and
SIDS
is
a
complex
variable
requiring
further
study
