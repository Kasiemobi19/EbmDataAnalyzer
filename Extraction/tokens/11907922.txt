Using
longitudinal
data
to
define
the
perimenopause
by
menstrual
cycle
characteristics
Abstract
Text
To
determine
which
aspects
of
menstrual
change
best
predict
time
to
postmenopause
A
total
of
250
Australian-born
women
aged
45-55
years
were
divided
into
five
menstrual
status
categories
Group
I
reported
no
change
in
menstrual
flow
or
frequency
Group
II
reported
change
in
flow
Group
III
reported
change
in
frequency
Group
IV
reported
change
in
both
frequency
and
flow
and
Group
V
reported
between
3
and
11
months
of
amenorrhea
Menstrual
status
groups
were
compared
on
baseline
data
for
age
hormone
levels
hot
flushes
and
self-rated
menopausal
status
The
proportion
of
women
moving
to
postmenopause
in
subsequent
years
was
compared
using
4
years
of
follow-up
data
Women
in
Group
V
were
older
had
lower
estradiol
and
inhibin
levels
higher
follicle
stimulating
hormone
levels
and
were
more
likely
to
report
hot
flushes
and
to
self-rate
themselves
as
having
started
the
menopausal
transition
compared
with
the
women
who
had
menstruated
in
the
last
3
months
(Groups
I-IV)
Groups
I
and
II
were
similar
in
age
and
hormonal
status
as
were
Groups
III
and
IV
The
proportion
of
women
who
had
moved
to
postmenopausal
status
in
the
4
years
after
baseline
were
12%
14%
58%
53%
and
94%
for
Groups
I-V
respectively
Amenorrhea
is
the
best
predictor
of
future
menopause
followed
by
changes
in
menstrual
frequency
Change
in
flow
only
was
not
predictive
of
future
menopause
A
two-stage
classification
scheme
is
suggested
for
defining
the
perimenopause
'Early
perimenopause'
is
defined
as
the
self-reporting
of
changes
in
menstrual
frequency
over
the
last
year
and
'late
perimenopause'
is
defined
as
the
self-report
of
3-11
months
of
amenorrhea
