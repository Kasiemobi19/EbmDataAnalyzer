Parathyroid
hormone-related
peptide
and
survival
of
patients
with
cancer
and
hypercalcemia
Abstract
Text
Parathyroid
hormone-related
peptide
(PTHrP)
is
the
predominant
cause
of
malignancy-associated
hypercalcemia
However
its
prognostic
utility
is
unclear
We
aimed
to
determine
the
prognostic
value
of
serum
PTHrP
levels
in
patients
who
had
hypercalcemia
associated
with
malignancy
In
this
prospective
case
series
we
evaluated
76
patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
cancer
and
hypercalcemia
(serum
calcium
level
>/=103
mg/dL
on
at
least
two
occasions)
PTHrP
levels
>/=1
pmol/L
were
considered
elevated
We
used
multivariate
Cox
regression
analysis
to
identify
factors
associated
with
mortality
Fifty
patients
(66%)
died
during
follow-up
In
a
multivariate
analysis
higher
pretreatment
calcium
levels
and
elevated
PTHrP
levels
were
associated
with
increased
mortality
with
effects
of
PTHrP
varying
by
age
(P
=
003)
Survival
was
associated
with
pretreatment
calcium
levels
both
in
patients
over
65
years
of
age
(hazard
ratio
[HR]
per
mg/dL
=
15
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
12
to
18
P
<0001)
and
in
patients
aged
65
years
or
less
(HR
=
13
95%
CI
11
to
15
P
=
0003)
Adjusted
for
pretreatment
calcium
levels
elevated
PTHrP
levels
were
associated
with
increased
mortality
in
patients
aged
</=65
years
(HR
=
38
95%
CI
16
to
88
P
=
0002)
but
not
in
older
patients
(HR
=
07
95%
CI
03
to
19
P
=
051)
PTHrP
is
a
useful
prognostic
factor
in
malignancy-associated
hypercalcemia
at
least
in
patients
aged
</=65
years
