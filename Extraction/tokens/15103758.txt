Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
quality
and
diagnostic
reliability
of
conventional
spin-echo
and
fast
spin-echo
with
fat
suppression
magnetic
resonance
(MR)
imaging
in
the
evaluation
of
cruciate
ligament
injury
Thirty-five
patients
with
internal
knee
injury
and
positive
clinical
signs
of
cruciate
ligament
injury
were
examined
by
using
an
Elscint
Prestige
2T
MR
scanner
Findings
of
conventional
and
fast
spin-echo
with
fat
suppression
MR
sequences
were
evaluated
and
compared
with
each
other
and
with
arthroscopic
findings
In
all
patients
arthroscopy
was
performed
within
2
months
after
the
MR
examination
Analysis
of
anterior
cruciate
ligament
injury
with
conventional
spin-echo
sequence
showed
818%
sensitivity
The
sensitivity
of
fast
spin-echo
sequences
with
fat
suppression
was
969%
According
to
the
type
of
the
anterior
cruciate
ligament
injury
the
sensitivity
of
fast
spin-echo
sequences
with
fat
suppression
was
higher
than
that
of
conventional
spin-echo
sequence
(857%
and
667%
respectively)
for
partial
rupture
but
the
sensitivity
of
both
sequences
for
complete
rupture
was
the
same
(100%
both)
Fast
spin-echo
with
fat
suppression
sequence
can
be
used
routinely
in
clinical
practice
for
the
assessment
of
acutely
injured
knees
as
the
substitute
for
conventional
spin-echo
sequence
without
decreased
diagnostic
reliability
