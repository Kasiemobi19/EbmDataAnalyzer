The
effects
of
acne
treatment
with
a
combination
of
benzoyl
peroxide
and
erythromycin
on
skin
carriage
of
erythromycin-resistant
propionibacteria
Abstract
Text
Concomitant
application
of
5%
w/w
benzoyl
peroxide
and
3%
w/w
erythromycin
has
previously
been
shown
to
prevent
the
overgrowth
on
the
skin
of
acne
patients
of
erythromycin-resistant
coagulase-negative
staphylococci
which
occurs
when
the
antibiotic
is
used
alone
Two
in
vivo
studies
were
carried
out
to
assess
the
ability
of
the
same
therapeutic
combination
to
inhibit
the
growth
of
pre-existing
erythromycin-resistant
propionibacteria
and
to
prevent
the
selection
of
resistant
strains
during
treatment
A
double-blind
clinical
trial
in
37
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
acne
vulgaris
showed
that
the
combination
brought
about
a
>
3
log10
cfu
reduction
in
total
propionibacterial
numbers/cm2
after
6
weeks
therapy
(P
<
0001
Wilcoxon's
matched
pairs)
and
also
significantly
reduced
the
number
of
erythromycin-resistant
propionibacteria
(P
<
005)
In
contrast
erythromycin
alone
reduced
the
total
propionibacterial
count
by
<
15
log10
cfu/cm2
after
6
weeks
(P
<
005)
and
did
not
affect
the
number
of
erythromycin-resistant
strains
The
combined
formulation
was
significantly
more
effective
at
reducing
total
propionibacterial
numbers
at
6
(P
<
001
Mann-Whitney)
and
12
weeks
(P
<
005)
than
erythromycin
alone
although
after
12
weeks
the
anti-propionibacterial
efficacy
of
both
preparations
was
less
marked
Five
patients
on
combination
therapy
and
five
treated
with
erythromycin
alone
acquired
erythromycin-resistant
strains
de
novo
at
week
6
or
week
12
In
an
open
study
in
21
acne
patients
who
each
carried
>
10(3)
cfu
erythromycin-resistant
propionibacteria/cm2
skin
pretreatment
the
combination
of
erythromycin
and
benzoyl
peroxide
reduced
the
total
propionibacterial
count
by
>
25
log10
and
the
number
of
erythromycin-resistant
strains
by
a
similar
amount
(P
<
0001
Wilcoxon)
This
was
accompanied
by
highly
significant
reductions
in
acne
grade
and
lesion
counts
(P
<
0001)
These
data
suggest
that
the
combination
of
5%
w/w
benzoyl
peroxide
and
3%
w/w
erythromycin
has
greater
in
vivo
anti-propionibacterial
activity
than
3%
w/w
erythromycin
alone
and
brings
about
significant
clinical
improvement
in
acne
patients
with
high
numbers
of
erythromycin-resistant
propionibacterial
strains
pretreatment
