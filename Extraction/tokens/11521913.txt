for
using
fluoride
to
prevent
and
control
dental
caries
in
the
United
States

Abstract
Text
Widespread
use
of
fluoride
has
been
a
major
factor
in
the
decline
in
the
prevalence
and
severity
of
dental
caries
(ie
tooth
decay)
in
the
United
States
and
other
economically
developed
countries
When
used
appropriately
fluoride
is
both
safe
and
effective
in
preventing
and
controlling
dental
caries
All
US
residents
are
likely
exposed
to
some
degree
to
fluoride
which
is
available
from
multiple
sources
Both
health-care
professionals
and
the
public
have
sought
guidance
on
selecting
the
best
way
to
provide
and
receive
fluoride
During
the
late
1990s
CDC
convened
a
work
group
to
develop
recommendations
for
using
fluoride
to
prevent
and
control
dental
caries
in
the
United
States
This
report
includes
these
recommendations
as
well
as
a)
critical
analysis
of
the
scientific
evidence
regarding
the
efficacy
and
effectiveness
of
fluoride
modalities
in
preventing
and
controlling
dental
caries
b)
ordinal
grading
of
the
quality
of
the
evidence
and
c)
assessment
of
the
strength
of
each
recommendation
Because
frequent
exposure
to
small
amounts
of
fluoride
each
day
will
best
reduce
the
risk
for
dental
caries
in
all
age
groups
the
work
group
recommends
that
all
persons
drink
water
with
an
optimal
fluoride
concentration
and
brush
their
teeth
twice
daily
with
fluoride
toothpaste
For
persons
at
high
risk
for
dental
caries
additional
fluoride
measures
might
be
needed
Measured
use
of
fluoride
modalities
is
particularly
appropriate
during
the
time
of
anterior
tooth
enamel
development
(ie
age
<6
years)
The
recommendations
in
this
report
guide
dental
and
other
health-care
providers
public
health
officials
policy
makers
and
the
public
in
the
use
of
fluoride
to
achieve
maximum
protection
against
dental
caries
while
using
resources
efficiently
and
reducing
the
likelihood
of
enamel
fluorosis
The
recommendations
address
public
health
and
professional
practice
self-care
consumer
product
industries
and
health
agencies
and
further
research
Adoption
of
these
recommendations
could
further
reduce
dental
caries
in
the
United
States
and
save
public
and
private
resources
