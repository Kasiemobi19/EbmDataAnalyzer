Effectiveness
of
the
postcoital
test
randomised
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
impact
of
the
postcoital
test
on
the
pregnancy
rate
among
subfertile
couples
and
on
the
number
of
other
diagnostic
tests
and
treatments
Randomised
controlled
study
A
university
and
two
non-university
teaching
hospitals
in
the
Netherlands
New
couples
at
infertility
clinics
1
March
1993
to
1
October
1995
randomisation
to
an
intervention
group
(series
of
infertility
investigations
that
include
the
postcoital
test)
or
to
a
control
group
(series
excluding
the
test)
Cumulative
pregnancy
rate
Of
736
consecutive
new
couples
444
fulfilled
the
inclusion
criteria
and
consented
to
participate
(intervention
group
227
control
group
217)
Treatment
was
given
more
often
in
the
intervention
group
than
in
the
control
group
(54%
v
41%
difference
13%
(95%
confidence
interval
4%
to
22%))
Yet
cumulative
pregnancy
rates
at
24
months
in
the
intervention
group
(49%
(42%
to
55%))
and
the
control
group
(48%
(42%
to
55%))
were
closely
similar
(difference
1%
(-90%
to
90%))
Routine
use
of
the
postcoital
test
in
infertility
investigations
leads
to
more
tests
and
treatments
but
has
no
significant
effect
on
the
pregnancy
rate
