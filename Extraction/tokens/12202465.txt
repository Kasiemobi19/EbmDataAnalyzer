Meta-analysis

postmenopausal
women
Abstract
Text
To
review
the
effect
of
alendronate
on
bone
density
and
fractures
in
postmenopausal
women
We
searched
MEDLINE
EMBASE
Current
Contents
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
trials
registry
from
1980
to
1999
and
we
examined
citations
of
relevant
articles
and
proceedings
of
international
meetings
We
included
11
trials
that
randomized
women
to
alendronate
or
placebo
and
measured
bone
density
for
at
least
1
yr
For
each
trial
three
independent
reviewers
assessed
the
methodological
quality
and
abstracted
data
The
pooled
relative
risk
(RR)
for
vertebral
fractures
in
patients
given
5
mg
or
more
of
alendronate
was
052
[95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
043-065]
The
RR
of
nonvertebral
fractures
in
patients
given
10
mg
or
more
of
alendronate
was
051
(95%
CI
038-069)
an
appreciably
greater
effect
than
for
the
5
mg
dose
We
found
a
similar
reduction
in
RR
across
nonvertebral
fracture
types
in
particular
RR
reductions
for
fractures
traditionally
thought
to
be
"osteoporotic"
such
as
hip
and
forearm
were
very
similar
to
RR
reductions
for
"nonosteoporotic"
fractures
Individual
studies
showed
similar
results
reflected
in
the
P
values
of
the
test
of
heterogeneity
(P
=
099
for
vertebral
and
088
for
nonvertebral
fractures)
Alendronate
produced
positive
effects
on
the
percentage
change
in
bone
density
which
increased
with
both
dose
and
time
After
3
yr
of
treatment
with
10
mg
of
alendronate
or
more
the
pooled
estimate
of
the
difference
in
percentage
change
between
alendronate
and
placebo
was
748%
(95%
CI
612-885)
for
the
lumbar
spine
(2-3
yr)
560%
(95%
CI
480-639)
for
the
hip
(3-4
yr)
208%
(95%
CI
153-263)
for
the
forearm
(2-4
yr)
and
273%
(95%
CI
227-320)
for
the
total
body
(3
yr)
Heterogeneity
of
the
treatment
effect
of
alendronate
was
not
consistently
explained
by
any
of
our
a
priori
hypotheses
in
particular
the
effect
was
very
similar
in
prevention
and
treatment
studies
The
pooled
RR
for
discontinuing
medication
due
to
adverse
effects
for
5
mg
or
greater
of
alendronate
was
115
(95%
CI
093-142)
The
pooled
RR
for
discontinuing
medication
due
to
gastro-intestinal
(GI)
side
effects
for
5
mg
or
greater
was
103
(081-130
P
=
083)
and
the
pooled
RR
for
GI
adverse
effects
with
continuation
of
medication
was
103
(098
to
107)
P
=
023
Alendronate
increases
bone
density
in
both
early
postmenopausal
women
and
those
with
established
osteoporosis
while
reducing
the
rate
of
vertebral
fracture
over
2-3
yr
of
treatment
Reductions
in
nonvertebral
fractures
are
evident
among
postmenopausal
women
without
prevalent
fractures
and
have
bone
mineral
density
(BMD)
levels
below
the
World
Health
Organization
threshold
for
osteoporosis
The
impact
on
fractures
appears
consistent
across
all
fracture
types
casting
doubt
on
traditional
distinctions
between
osteoporotic
and
nonosteoporotic
fractures
