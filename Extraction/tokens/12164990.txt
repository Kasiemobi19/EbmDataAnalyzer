Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effects
of
a
medicated
chewing
gum
on
the
oral
health
of
frail
older
people
A
controlled
double-blind
trial
using
three
groups
based
on
random
allocation
of
residential
homes
Sixteen
residential
homes
in
West
Hertfordshire
England
One
hundred
eleven
dentate
subjects
aged
60
and
older
who
completed
the
12-month
study
Subjects
were
assigned
to
a
chlorhexidine
acetate/xylitol
gum
(ACHX)
group
a
xylitol
gum
(X)
group
or
a
no-gum
(N)
group
Subjects
in
the
gum
groups
chewed
two
pellets
for
15
minutes
twice
daily
for
12
months
Primary
outcome
measures
were
salivary
flow
rate
denture
debris
score
prevalence
of
angular
cheilitis
and
denture
stomatitis
secondary
outcome
measures
were
salivary
levels
of
caries-associated
microorganisms
A
single
examiner
who
was
blinded
to
group
allocation
made
all
measurements
at
baseline
before
gum
usage
and
at
subsequent
examinations
after
3
6
9
and
12
months
Separate
analyses
were
performed
for
subjects
with
dentures
Subjects
in
the
three
groups
were
similar
in
most
of
their
baseline
characteristics
The
stimulated
whole
saliva
flow
rate
+/-
standard
deviation
increased
significantly
for
the
ACHX
(14
+/-
07
mL/min)
and
X
(16
+/-
09
mL/min)
groups
(P
<01)
over
baseline
(ACHX
=
09
+/-
06
mL/min
X
=
08
+/-
06
mL/min)
and
N
group
levels
(06
+/-
09
mL/min)
The
levels
of
mutans
streptococci
lactobacilli
and
yeasts
significantly
increased
(P
<05)
in
the
X
and
N
groups
Denture
debris
status
was
significantly
lower
in
the
ACHX
and
X
groups
than
at
baseline
or
in
the
N
group
(P
<01)
The
reductions
of
91%
and
75%
in
denture
stomatitis
and
angular
cheilitis
prevalence
respectively
that
occurred
in
the
ACHX
group
were
significantly
greater
(P
<01)
than
the
reductions
in
the
X
group
(denture
stomatitis
62%
angular
cheilitis
43%)
Prevalence
of
denture
stomatitis
and
angular
cheilitis
were
not
significantly
changed
in
the
N
group
The
use
of
a
medicated
chewing
gum
significantly
improved
oral
health
in
older
occupants
of
residential
homes
Chewing
gums
should
be
considered
as
a
potential
adjunct
to
other
oral
hygiene
procedures
in
older
subjects
