Abstract
Text
Male
osteoporosis
represents
an
important
although
long
underestimated
public
health
problem
Both
in
men
and
in
women
aging
is
accompanied
by
continuous
bone
loss
and
by
an
exponential
increase
in
the
incidence
of
osteoporotic
fracture
with
a
female
to
male
incidence
ratio
of
about
2
to
3
to
1
in
the
elderly
for
hip
and
vertebral
fractures
Morbidity
after
osteoporotic
fractures
appears
to
be
more
serious
and
mortality
more
common
in
men
than
in
women
To
date
no
single
treatment
has
been
proved
to
be
effective
and
safe
in
published
prospective
studies
The
present
report
based
on
a
systematic
search
of
the
literature
on
male
osteoporosis
summarises
the
state
of
the
art
on
the
clinical
consequences
of
male
osteoporosis
and
its
risk
factors
in
relation
to
the
present
state
of
knowledge
about
female
osteoporosis
This
constitutes
the
background
for
the
design
of
rational
clinical
development
strategies
for
therapeutic
interventions
in
male
osteoporosis
From
this
review
of
the
literature
it
is
apparent
that
notwithstanding
the
existing
sex
differences
in
pathophysiology
of
osteoporosis
and
the
difference
in
age-specific
incidence
of
osteoporotic
fractures
there
are
also
important
similarities
between
osteoporosis
in
women
and
men
The
higher
incidence
of
fracture
in
women
than
in
men
results
from
quantitative
differences
in
risk
factors
rather
than
from
different
risk
factors
Even
though
there
are
sex
differences
in
bone
geometry
incidence
of
fracture
seems
to
be
similar
in
men
and
women
for
a
same
absolute
areal
bone
mineral
density
However
the
lack
of
data
on
the
changes
in
fracture
rates
in
men
resulting
from
pharmacological
intervention
leading
to
changes
in
bone
mineral
density
or
bone
turnover
remains
the
main
limitation
for
extrapolation
of
established
treatment
outcomes
from
women
to
men
