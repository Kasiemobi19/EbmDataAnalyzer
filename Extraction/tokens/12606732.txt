Frequent
ventricular
ectopy
after
exercise
as
a
predictor
of
death
Abstract
Text
Exercise-induced
ventricular
ectopy
predicts
an
increased
risk
of
death
in
population-based
cohorts
We
sought
to
examine
in
a
clinical
cohort
the
prognostic
importance
of
ventricular
ectopy
immediately
after
exercise
when
reactivation
of
parasympathetic
activity
occurs
We
hypothesized
that
ventricular
ectopy
after
exercise
(ie
during
the
recovery
phase)
would
predict
an
increased
risk
of
death
better
than
ventricular
ectopy
during
exercise
We
studied
29244
patients
(mean
[+/-SD]
age
56+/-11
years
70
percent
men)
who
had
been
referred
for
symptom-limited
exercise
testing
without
a
history
of
heart
failure
valve
disease
or
arrhythmia
Frequent
ventricular
ectopy
was
defined
by
the
presence
of
seven
or
more
ventricular
premature
beats
per
minute
ventricular
bigeminy
or
trigeminy
ventricular
couplets
or
triplets
ventricular
tachycardia
ventricular
flutter
torsade
de
pointes
or
ventricular
fibrillation
Frequent
ventricular
ectopy
occurred
only
during
exercise
in
945
patients
(3
percent)
only
during
recovery
in
589
(2
percent)
and
during
both
exercise
and
recovery
in
491
(2
percent)
There
were
1862
deaths
during
a
mean
of
53
years
of
follow-up
Frequent
ventricular
ectopy
during
exercise
predicted
an
increased
risk
of
death
(five-year
death
rate
9
percent
vs
5
percent
among
patients
without
frequent
ventricular
ectopy
during
exercise
hazard
ratio
18
95
percent
confidence
interval
15
to
21
P<0001)
but
frequent
ventricular
ectopy
during
recovery
was
a
stronger
predictor
(11
percent
vs
5
percent
hazard
ratio
24
95
percent
confidence
interval
20
to
29
P<0001)
After
propensity
matching
for
confounding
variables
frequent
ventricular
ectopy
during
recovery
predicted
an
increased
risk
of
death
(adjusted
hazard
ratio
15
95
percent
confidence
interval
11
to
19
P=0003)
but
frequent
ventricular
ectopy
during
exercise
did
not
(adjusted
hazard
ratio
11
95
percent
confidence
interval
09
to
13
P=053)
Frequent
ventricular
ectopy
during
recovery
after
exercise
is
a
better
predictor
of
an
increased
risk
of
death
than
ventricular
ectopy
occurring
only
during
exercise
