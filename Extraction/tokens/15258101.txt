Abstract
Text
Toxicology
studies
are
typically
performed
on
single
compounds
which
we
hypothesized
would
miss
adverse
synergies
from
chemical
mixtures
This
hypothesis
was
tested
using
an
insect
repellant
and
sunscreens
because
both
groups
include
known
permeation
enhancers
with
prior
pediatric
reports
of
toxicity
from
highly
concentrated
DEET
(NN-diethyl-m-toluamide)
Using
real-time
mass
spectroscopy
in
a
hairless
mouse
skin
model
we
confirmed
substantial
penetration
of
a
20%
DEET
standard
Despite
a
lower
(10%)
DEET
content
a
commercially
marketed
sunscreen
formulation
had
a
6-fold
more
rapid
detection
(5
versus
30
min)
and
34-fold
greater
penetration
at
steady
state
We
also
tested
the
efficacy
of
DEET
microemulsion
products
and
confirmed
that
one
successfully
slowed
the
onset
of
absorption
but
not
the
steady-state
permeation
Risks
from
mixtures
of
potential
toxins
are
worthy
of
routine
testing
which
can
be
accomplished
by
simple
assays
and
are
of
utmost
importance
for
pediatric
applications
