The
importance
of
clarithromycin
dose
in
the
management
of
Helicobacter
pylori
infection
a
meta-analysis
of
triple
therapies
with
a
proton
pump
inhibitor
clarithromycin
and
amoxycillin
or
metronidazole
Abstract
Text
It
is
not
clear
which
dose
of
clarithromycin
(500
mg
bd
or
250
mg
bd)
is
more
effective
for
Helicobacter
pylori
eradication
in
proton
pump
inhibitor-based
triple
therapies
We
undertook
a
meta-analysis
of
the
effect
of
7-day
triple
therapies
consisting
of
a
proton
pump
inhibitor
(P)
and
clarithromycin
(C)
and
amoxycillin
(A)
or
metronidazole
(M)
A
meta-analysis
of
all
clinical
trials
performed
in
an
adult
population
and
published
in
English
up
to
March
1998
was
undertaken
Studies
with
doses
of
clarithromycin
500
mg
bd
or
250
mg
bd
only
were
included
A
total
of
82
studies
(31
papers
and
51
abstracts)
involving
110
treatment
arms
and
6123
patients
were
analysed
that
met
the
predetermined
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
In
the
PAC
combination
the
pooled
eradication
rate
in
patients
treated
with
clarithromycin
500
mg
bd
was
895%
(95%
CI
869-92
0%)
by
per
protocol
analysis
and
866%
(95%
CI
810-893%)
by
intention-to-treat
analysis
These
rates
are
significantly
higher
than
those
achieved
with
clarithromycin
250
mg
bd
(833%
by
per
protocol
and
782%
by
intention-to-treat
analysis
both
P
<
00001)
This
difference
was
confirmed
in
head-to-head
comparative
studies
In
the
PMC
regimen
clarithromycin
500
mg
bd
eradicated
908%
(95%
CI
870-945%)
of
the
infections
compared
to
885%
(95%
CI
855-91
5%)
in
patients
treated
with
clarithromycin
250
mg
bd
by
per
protocol
analysis
(P
=
0082)
The
corresponding
rates
by
intention-to-treat
analysis
for
clarithromycin
500
mg
bd
and
250
mg
bd
was
883%
and
867%
respectively
(P
=
0259)
Seven-day
triple
therapies
with
a
proton
pump
inhibitor
clarithromycin
and
amoxycillin
or
metronidazole
are
highly
effective
treatments
for
the
eradication
of
H
pylori
Clarithromycin
500
mg
b
d
should
be
used
in
these
combinations
to
achieve
the
best
first
treatment
results
which
can
minimize
the
subsequent
development
of
bacterial
resistance
to
clarithromycin
and
metronidazole
