Title
Breast
stimulation
for
cervical
ripening
and
induction
of
labour
Abstract
Text
Breast
stimulation
has
been
suggested
as
a
means
of
inducing
labour
It
is
a
non-medical
intervention
allowing
women
greater
control
over
the
induction
process
This
is
one
of
a
series
of
reviews
of
methods
of
cervical
ripening
and
labour
induction
using
a
standardised
methodology
To
determine
the
effectiveness
of
breast
stimulation
for
third
trimester
cervical
ripening
or
induction
of
labour
in
comparison
with
placebo/no
intervention
or
other
methods
of
induction
of
labour
The
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group
Trials
Register
(March
2004)
and
bibliographies
of
relevant
papers
Clinical
trials
of
breast
stimulation
for
third
trimester
cervical
ripening
or
labour
induction
A
strategy
was
developed
to
deal
with
the
large
volume
and
complexity
of
trial
data
relating
to
labour
induction
This
involved
a
two-stage
method
of
data
extraction
Six
trials
(719
women)
were
included
Analysis
of
trials
comparing
breast
stimulation
with
no
intervention
found
a
significant
reduction
in
the
number
of
women
not
in
labour
at
72
hours
(627%
versus
936%
relative
risk
(RR)
067
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
060
to
074)
This
result
was
not
significant
in
women
with
an
unfavourable
cervix
A
major
reduction
in
the
rate
of
postpartum
haemorrhage
was
reported
(07%
versus
6%
RR
016
95%
CI
003
to
087)
No
significant
difference
was
detected
in
the
caesarean
section
rate
(9%
versus
10%
RR
090
95%
CI
038
to
212)
or
rates
of
meconium
staining
There
were
no
instances
of
uterine
hyperstimulation
Three
perinatal
deaths
were
reported
(18%
versus
0%
RR
817
95%
CI
045
to
14777)
When
comparing
breast
stimulation
with
oxytocin
alone
the
analysis
found
no
difference
in
caesarean
section
rates
(28%
versus
47%
RR
060
95%
CI
031
to
118)
No
difference
was
detected
in
the
number
of
women
not
in
labour
after
72
hours
(588%
versus
25%
RR
235
95%
CI
100
to
554)
or
rates
of
meconium
staining
There
were
four
perinatal
deaths
(176%
versus
5%
RR
353
95%
CI
040
to
3088)
Breast
stimulation
appears
beneficial
in
relation
to
the
number
of
women
not
in
labour
after
72
hours
and
reduced
postpartum
haemorrhage
rates
Until
safety
issues
have
been
fully
evaluated
it
should
not
be
used
in
high-risk
women
Further
research
is
required
to
evaluate
its
safety
and
should
seek
data
on
postpartum
haemorrhage
rates
number
of
women
not
in
labour
at
72
hours
and
maternal
satisfaction
