Effectiveness
of
screening
examinations
to

unrecognized
exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
Abstract
Text
To
determine
if
a
physician-administered
physical
examination
and
screening
questionnaire
accurately
detects
exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
(EIB)
in
adolescent
athletes
Study
design
Cross-sectional
study
of
256
adolescents
participating
in
organized
sports
from
3
suburban
high
schools
The
number
of
persons
screened
positive
for
EIB
by
physical
examination
and
questionnaire
was
compared
with
the
number
of
persons
with
EIB
diagnosed
by
a
"gold
standard"
test
that
consisted
of
a
7-minute
exercise
challenge
followed
by
serial
spirometry
We
diagnosed
EIB
in
94%
of
adolescent
athletes
The
screening
history
identified
persons
with
symptoms
or
a
previous
diagnosis
suggestive
of
EIB
in
395%
of
the
participants
but
only
129%
of
these
persons
actually
had
EIB
Among
adolescents
with
a
negative
review
of
symptoms
of
asthma
or
EIB
78%
had
EIB
Among
adolescents
with
no
previous
diagnosis
of
asthma
allergic
rhinitis
or
EIB
72%
had
EIB
diagnosed
by
exercise
challenge
Persons
who
screened
negative
on
all
questions
about
symptoms
or
history
of
asthma
EIB
and
allergic
rhinitis
accounted
for
458%
of
the
adolescents
with
EIB
EIB
occurs
frequently
in
adolescent
athletes
and
screening
by
physical
examination
and
medical
history
does
not
accurately
detect
it
