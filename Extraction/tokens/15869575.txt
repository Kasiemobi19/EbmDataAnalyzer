Abstract
Text
The
optimal
intensity
of
oral
anticoagulation
for
the
prevention
of
recurrent
thrombosis
in
patients
with
antiphospholipid
antibody
syndrome
is
uncertain
Retrospective
studies
show
that
only
high-intensity
oral
anticoagulation
[target
international
normalized
ratio
(INR)
>30]
is
effective
but
a
recent
randomized
clinical
trial
comparing
high
(INR
range
30-40)
vs
moderate
(INR
20-30)
intensities
of
anticoagulation
failed
to
confirm
this
assumption
We
conducted
a
randomized
trial
in
which
109
patients
with
antiphospholipid
syndrome
(APS)
and
previous
thrombosis
were
given
either
high-intensity
warfarin
(INR
range
30-45
54
patients)
or
standard
antithrombotic
therapy
(warfarin
INR
range
20-30
in
52
patients
or
aspirin
alone
100
mg
day(-1)
in
three
patients)
to
determine
whether
intensive
anticoagulation
is
superior
to
standard
treatment
in
preventing
symptomatic
thromboembolism
without
increasing
the
bleeding
risk
The
109
patients
enrolled
in
the
trial
were
followed
up
for
a
median
time
of
36
years
Mean
INR
during
follow-up
was
32
(SD
06)
in
the
high-intensity
warfarin
group
and
25
(SD
03)
(P
<
00001)
in
the
conventional
treatment
patients
given
warfarin
Recurrent
thrombosis
was
observed
in
six
of
54
patients
(111%)
assigned
to
receive
high-intensity
warfarin
and
in
three
of
55
patients
(55%)
assigned
to
receive
conventional
treatment
[hazard
ratio
for
the
high
intensity
group
197
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)

Major
and
minor
bleeding
occurred
in
15
patients
(two
major)
(278%)
assigned
to
receive
high-intensity
warfarin
and
eight
(three
major)
(146%)
assigned
to
receive
conventional
treatment
(hazard
ratio
218
95%
CI
092-515)
High-intensity
warfarin
was
not
superior
to
standard
treatment
in
preventing
recurrent
thrombosis
in
patients
with
APS
and
was
associated
with
an
increased
rate
of
minor
hemorrhagic
complications
