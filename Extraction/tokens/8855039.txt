Title
The
efficacy
of
surgical
modifications
of
the
upper
airway
in
adults
with
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
Abstract
Text
This
paper
which
has
been
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
Board
of
Directors
of
the
American
Sleep
Disorders
Association
provides
the
background
for
the
Standards
of
Practice
Committee's
parameters
for
the
practice
of
sleep
medicine
in
North
America
The
intent
of
this
paper
is
to
provide
an
overview
of
the
surgical
treatment
of
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
to
provide
the
basis
for
the
American
Sleep
Disorders
Association's
practice
parameters
on
this
subject
and
to
share
our
findings
of
metanalysis
of
previously
published
studies
regarding
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
We
searched
MEDLINE
from
January
1966
through
April
1993
with
an
update
in
February
1995
to
provide
a
review
of
the
application
of
surgical
modifications
of
the
upper
airway
to
treat
adults
with
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
Operations
to
treat
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
include
nasal
septal
reconstruction
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
uvulopalatopharyngoglossoplasty
laser
midline
glossectomy
lingualplasty
inferior
sagittal
mandibular
osteotomy
and
genioglossal
advancement
with
hyoid
myotomy
and
suspension
(the
entire
process
is
referred
to
as
GAHM)
maxillomandibular
osteotomy
and
advancement
and
tracheotomy
Papers
included
in
metanalysis
provided
preoperative
and
postoperative
polysomnographic
data
on
at
least
nine
patients
treated
with
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
for
their
obstructive
sleep
apnea
Analysis
of
the
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
papers
revealed
that
this
procedure
is
at
best
effective
in
treating
less
than
50%
of
patients
with
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
The
site
of
pharyngeal
narrowing
or
collapse
although
identified
by
different
and
unvalidated
methods
has
a
marked
effect
on
the
probability
of
success
of
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
Patients
who
achieve
a
favorable
response
with
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
tend
to
have
less
severe
obstructive
sleep
apnea
than
those
who
do
not
For
patients
who
demonstrate
retrolingual
narrowing
or
collapse
other
surgical
modifications
have
been
described
such
as
lingualplasty
GAHM
and
maxillomandibular
osteotomy
and
advancement
The
studies
to
support
the
use
of
the
surgical
treatment
of
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
contain
biases
related
to
small
sample
size
limited
follow-up
and
patient
selection
