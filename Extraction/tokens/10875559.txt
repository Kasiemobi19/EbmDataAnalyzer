Abstract
Text
To
establish
the
evidence
base
for
the
diagnosis
of
sleep
apnea
(SA)
in
adult
patients
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
from
1980
through
November
1
1997
was
performed
Diagnostic
studies
were
included
if
they
reported
results
of
any
test
to
establish
or
support
a
diagnosis
of
SA
in
comparison
to
a
diagnosis
from
a
full
polysomnogram
(PSG)
Test
results
were
meta-analyzed
using
fixed
effects
models
and
summary
receiver
operating
characteristic
curves
(ROCs)
to
examine
consistency
of
tests
within
and
between
diagnostics
vs
the
"gold
standard"
of
PSG
From
a
total
of
937
studies
249
fit
the
broad
eligibility
criteria
for
inclusion
in
the
clinical
trial
database
and
its
data
were
extracted
from
these
reports
useable
data
for
statistical
analyses
were
reported
in
71
studies
(7572
patients)
The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
partial
channel
and
partial
time
PSGs
appeared
most
promising
as
replacements
for
full
PSG
in
patients
suspected
of
obstructive
SA
Clinical
prediction
rules
(multivariate
models)
were
also
promising
Studies
of
portable
sleep
monitors
radiologic
or
morphologic
features
and
focused
questionnaires
were
too
heterogeneous
to
be
meta-analyzed
In
general
the
diversity
of
study
designs
and
objectives
were
very
high
and
the
methodological
rigor
of
these
studies
as
assessments
of
diagnostic
tests
was
very
low
Thus
we
are
still
not
in
a
position
to
recommend
standardization
of
diagnostic
methodology
for
sleep
apnea
Instead
our
recommendations
for
future
research
include
standardization
of
terms
and
diagnostic
criteria
and
consistently
reported
statistics
to
enhance
the
utility
of
this
literature
