Title
Idiopathic
toe-walking
does
treatment
alter
the
natural
history
Abstract
Text
Outcomes
from
observation
or
cast
or
surgical
treatment
of
idiopathic
toe-walking
were
determined
in
136
children
With
patient-determined
outcomes
for
the
observation
group
gait
was
normal
in
6%
improved
in
45%
and
unchanged
in
49%
Physician-determined
outcomes
demonstrated
normal
gait
in
12%
of
children
Outcomes
were
similar
in
the
cast
group
With
patient-determined
outcomes
in
the
surgical
group
22%
walked
normally
50%
had
improved
26%
were
unchanged
and
2%
had
deteriorated
with
physician-determined
outcomes
37%
walked
normally
The
natural
history
determined
from
the
observation
group
was
for
idiopathic
toe-walking
to
persist
albeit
with
improvement
in
50%
Cast
treatment
did
not
alter
the
natural
history
Surgical
treatment
may
influence
the
outcome
but
indications
for
surgery
need
to
be
clarified
