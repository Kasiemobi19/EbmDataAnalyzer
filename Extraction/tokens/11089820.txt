Statins
and
the
risk

dementia
Abstract
Text
Dementia
affects
an
estimated
10%
of
the
population
older
than
65
years
Because
vascular
and
lipid-related
mechanisms
are
thought
to
have
a
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
Alzheimer's
disease
and
vascular
dementia
we
did
an
epidemiological
study
of
the
potential
effect
of
HMGCoA
(3
hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme
A)
reductase
inhibitors
(statins)
and
other
lipid-lowering
agents
on
dementia
We
used
a
nested
case-control
design
with
information
derived
from
368
practices
which
contribute
to
the
UK-based
General
Practice
Research
Database
The
base
study
population
included
three
groups
of
patients
age
50
years
and
older
all
individuals
who
had
received
lipid-lowering
agents
(LLAs)
all
individuals
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
untreated
hyperlipidaemia
and
a
randomly
selected
group
of
other
individuals
From
this
base
population
all
cases
with
a
computer-recorded
clinical
diagnosis
of
dementia
were
identified
Each
case
was
matched
with
up
to
four
controls
derived
from
the
base
population
on
age
sex
practice
and
index
date
of
case
The
study
encompassed
284
cases
with
dementia
and
1080
controls
Among
controls
13%
had
untreated
hyperlipidaemia
11%
were
prescribed
statins
7%
other
LLAs
and
69%
had
no
hyperlipidaemia
or
LLA
exposure
The
relative
risk
estimates
of
dementia
adjusted
for
age
sex
history
of
coronary-artery
disease
hypertension
coronary-bypass
surgery
and
cerebral
ischaemia
smoking
and
body
mass
index
for
individuals
with
untreated
hyperlipidaemia
(odds
ratio
072
[95%
CI
045-114])
or
treated
with
nonstatin
LLAs
(096
[047-197]
was
close
to
10
and
not
significant
compared
with
people
who
had
no
diagnosis
of
hyperlipidaemia
or
exposure
to
other
lipid-lowering
drugs
The
adjusted
relative
risk
for
those
prescribed
statins
was
029
(013-063
p=0002)
Individuals
of
50
years
and
older
who
were
prescribed
statins
had
a
substantially
lowered
risk
of
developing
dementia
independent
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
untreated
hyperlipidaemia
or
exposure
to
nonstatin
LLAs
The
available
data
do
not
distinguish
between
Alzheimer's
disease
and
other
forms
of
dementia
