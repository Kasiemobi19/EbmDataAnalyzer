Long-term
malaria
prophylaxis
with
weekly
mefloquine
Abstract
Text
The
spread
of
chloroquine-resistant
Plasmodium
falciparum
malaria
has
led
to
increased
use
of
mefloquine
prophylaxis
by
US
Peace
Corps
volunteers
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
We
compared
long-term
mefloquine
with
other
drug
regimens
for
effectiveness
and
tolerance
The
incidence
of
Plasmodium
falciparum
infections
and
of
adverse
reactions
was
compared
in
Peace
Corps
volunteers
who
took
chloroquine
weekly
mefloquine
weekly
mefloquine
every
other
week
or
weekly
chloroquine
plus
daily
proguanil
Weekly
mefloquine
was
94%
more
effective
than
chloroquine
(95%
CI
86%
to
97%)
86%
more
effective
than
chloroquine
plus
proguanil
(95%
CI
67%
to
94%)
and
82%
more
effective
than
prophylaxis
with
mefloquine
when
taken
every
other
week
(95%
CI
68%
to
90%)
No
serious
adverse
reactions
were
observed
Mild
adverse
events
were
equally
frequent
in
mefloquine
users
and
chloroquine
users
and
the
frequency
of
these
events
declined
with
increasing
duration
of
prophylaxis
Mefloquine
is
an
effective
and
well-tolerated
drug
for
prophylaxis
of
malaria
by
short-term
and
long-term
travellers
