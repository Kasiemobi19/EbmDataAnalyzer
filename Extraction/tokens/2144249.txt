dermatitis
Abstract
Text
In
an
open
study
19
infants
with
a
bipolar
seborrhoeic
rash
were
treated
with
ketoconazole
2%
in
cream
once
a
day
and
evaluated
over
10
days
of
treatment
At
day
10
789%
of
patients
were
almost
cleared
Percutaneous
absorption
peaked
1-3
h
after
topical
treatment
and
was
minimal
No
plasma
ketoconazole
accumulation
over
the
10-day
treatment
was
detected
Treatment
failures
corresponded
to
histologically
psoriasiform
eruptions
and
probable
atopic
dermatitis
