Diagnosing
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
A
comprehensive
analysis
and
considerations
for
developing
a
new
model
Abstract
Text
--To
examine
the
accuracy
of
existing
diagnostic
indicators
for
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
and
to
develop
guidelines
for
a
new
diagnostic
model
--Studies
were
identified
for
the
period
1969
through
1990
A
Medline
search
of
the
English-language
literature
was
conducted
using
the
subject
terms
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
or
salpingitis
and
diagnosis
In
addition
abstracts
and
bibliographies
of
articles
and
books
were
reviewed
--Studies
were
selected
if
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
was
diagnosed
using
laparoscopic
findings
or
narrow
clinical
rules
Of
the
15
reports
identified
12
were
included
in
this
analysis
The
selected
studies
were
grouped
by
a
quality
rating
based
on
subject
selection
definition
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
data
analysis
and
other
measures
--Diagnostic
findings
were
divided
into
four
categories
historical
(symptoms)
clinical
examination
(signs)
laboratory
and
combinations
of
the
above
Sensitivity
and
specificity
were
extracted
using
raw
data
Data
were
classified
by
quality
rating
--Historical
findings
were
usually
not
statistically
significant
predictors
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
and
when
they
were
they
tended
toward
low
sensitivity
and
high
specificity
while
clinical
findings
were
somewhat
more
sensitive
and
about
as
specific
Several
laboratory
tests
showed
consistent
value
in
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
diagnosis
with
high
sensitivity
and
specificity
Combinations
of
indicators
permitted
high
sensitivity
or
high
specificity
but
not
both
simultaneously
--No
single
or
combination
diagnostic
indicator
was
found
to
reliably
predict
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
Combining
published
evidence
with
practical
clinical
considerations
a
diagnostic
approach
is
proposed
that
emphasizes
diagnostic
sensitivity
when
clinical
presentation
is
mild
and
more
thorough
evaluation
when
a
woman
is
severely
ill
Research
is
needed
to
evaluate
the
accuracy
and
acceptability
of
specific
diagnostic
models
and
to
investigate
new
diagnostic
indicators
