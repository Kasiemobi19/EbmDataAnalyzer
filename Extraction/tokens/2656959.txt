Acetaminophen
more
harm
than
good
for
chickenpox
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
acetaminophen
affects
the
duration
or
severity
of
childhood
varicella
Randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Office-
and
hospital-based
pediatric
practices
Seventy-two
children
between
1
and
12
years
of
age
entered
the
study
One
child
was
withdrawn
because
of
high
fever
and
three
children
did
not
complete
the
study
31
received
placebo
and
37
received
acetaminophen
Acetaminophen
10
mg/kg/dose
was
given
at
8
AM
12
PM
4
PM
and
8
PM
for
4
days
Placebo
was
given
to
the
control
group
Itching
appetite
activity
and
overall
condition
were
measured
for
6
days
The
time
to
last
vesicle
formation
time
to
total
scabbing
and
time
to
total
healing
were
measured
until
complete
resolution
of
the
exanthem
The
following
results
were
better
in
the
placebo
group
(p
less
than
05)
time
to
total
scabbing
56
days
(SD
25)
versus
67
days
(SD
23)
in
the
acetaminophen
group
and
itching
on
day
4
in
the
placebo
group
(symptom
score
29
(SD
020)
vs
22
(SD
026]
Activity
was
better
in
the
acetaminophen
group
on
day
2
(313
(SD
023)
vs
282
(SD
024]
These
results
provide
evidence
that
acetaminophen
does
not
alleviate
symptoms
in
children
with
varicella
and
may
prolong
illness
