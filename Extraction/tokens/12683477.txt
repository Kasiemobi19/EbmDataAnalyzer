Abstract
Text
This
study
was
conducted
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
an
abbreviated
cognitive-behavioral
insomnia
therapy
(ACBT)
with
primary

A
single-blind
randomized
group
design
was
used
in
which
study
patients
were
randomized
to
either
a
brief
2-session
ACBT
or
a
similarly
brief
intervention
(SHC)
that
included
only
generic
sleep
hygiene
recommendations
A
university-affiliated
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
medical
center
Twenty
(2
women)
veteran
patients
(M(age)
=
510
yrs
SD
=
137
years)
who
met
criteria
for
chronic
primary
insomnia
Participants
completed
sleep
logs
for
2
weeks
and
questionnaires
to
measures
insomnia
symptoms
sleep-related
self-efficacy
and
dysfunctional
beliefs
about
sleep
before
treatment
during
a
2-week
posttreatment
assessment
and
again
at
a
3-month
posttreatment
follow-up
Statistical
analyses
showed
that
ACBT
produced
significantly
larger
improvements
across
a
majority
of
outcome
measures
than
did
SHC
Case-by-case
analyses
showed
that
only
the
ACBT
produced
consistent
positive
effects
across
study
patients
and
a
sizeable
proportion
of
these
patients
receiving
this
treatment
achieved
clinically
significant
improvements
by
their
study
endpoints
Approximately
52%
of
those
receiving
the
ACBT
reported
at
least
a
50%
reduction
in
their
wake
time
after
sleep
onset
and
556%
of
ACBT-treated
patients
who
entered
the
study
with
pathologic
scores
on
an
Insomnia
Symptom
Questionnaire
(ISQ)
achieved
normal
ISQ
scores
by
their
final
outcome
assessment
ACBT
is
effective
for
reducing
subjective
sleep
disturbance
and
insomnia
symptoms
in
primary
care
patients
