A
placebo-controlled
crossover
trial
of
nimodipine
in
pediatric
migraine
Abstract
Text
An
8-month
double-blind
placebo-controlled
crossover
trial
was
carried
out
on
the
use
of
nimodipine
in
migraine
prophylaxis
in
37
patients
aged
7
to
18
years
old
After
a
4-week
medication-free
run-in
period
19
subjects
(Group
1)
received
a
placebo
while
18
(Group
2)
received
nimodipine
(10-20
mg
tid
according
to
body
weight)
for
12
weeks
After
a
4-week
wash-out
period
the
groups
switched
therapy
for
a
further
12
weeks
30
patients
completed
the
trial
and
the
number
of
dropouts
was
comparable
in
the
2
groups
The
only
side-effect
during
nimodipine
treatment
was
mild
abdominal
discomfort
(3
cases)
The
treatments
were
evaluated
on
the
basis
of
frequency
and
duration
of
attacks
There
was
a
significant
reduction
in
both
parameters
during
the
first
period
of
treatment
During
the
second
period
of
treatment
nimodipine
proved
to
have
a
significantly
greater
effect
than
the
placebo
with
regard
to
frequency
whereas
the
response
was
similar
with
the
placebo
as
regards
duration
of
attacks
The
latter
parameter
shows
a
significant
decrease
during
the
treatment
periods
regardless
of
type
of
therapy
