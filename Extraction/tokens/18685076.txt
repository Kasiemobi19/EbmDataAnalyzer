Abstract
Text
To
review
the
published
literature
on
the
effectiveness
of
interventions
to
promote
physical
activity
in
children
and
adolescents
Systematic
review
Literature
search
using
PubMed
SCOPUS

and
Embase
up
to
December
2006
Two
independent
reviewers
assessed
studies
against
the
following
inclusion
criteria
controlled
trial
comparison
of
intervention
to
promote
physical
activity
with
no
intervention
control
condition
participants
younger
than
18
years
and
reported
statistical
analyses
of
a
physical
activity
outcome
measure
Levels
of
evidence
accounting
for
methodological
quality
were
assessed
for
three
types
of
intervention
five
settings
and
three
target
populations
The
literature
search
identified
57
studies
33
aimed
at
children
and
24
at
adolescents
Twenty
four
studies
were
of
high
methodological
quality
including
13
studies
in
children
Interventions
that
were
found
to
be
effective
achieved
increases
ranging
from
an
additional
26
minutes
of
physical
education
related
physical
activity
to
283
minutes
per
week
of
overall
physical
activity
Among
children
limited
evidence
for
an
effect
was
found
for
interventions
targeting
children
from
low
socioeconomic
populations
and
environmental
interventions
Strong
evidence
was
found
that
school
based
interventions
with
involvement
of
the
family
or
community
and
multicomponent
interventions
can
increase
physical
activity
in
adolescents
Some
evidence
was
found
for
potentially
effective
strategies
to
increase
children's
levels
of
physical
activity
For
adolescents
multicomponent
interventions
and
interventions
that
included
both
school
and
family
or
community
involvement
have
the
potential
to
make
important
differences
to
levels
of
physical
activity
and
should
be
promoted
A
lack
of
high
quality
evaluations
hampers
conclusions
concerning
effectiveness
especially
among
children
