Title
Physician
advice
for
smoking
cessation
Abstract
Text
Healthcare
professionals
frequently
advise
patients
to
improve
their
health
by
stopping
smoking
Such
advice
may
be
brief
or
part
of
more
intensive
interventions
The
aims
of
this
review
were
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
advice
from
physicians
in
promoting
smoking
cessation
to
compare
minimal
interventions
by
physicians
with
more
intensive
interventions
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
various
aids
to
advice
in
promoting
smoking
cessation
and
to
determine
the
effect
of
anti-smoking
advice
on
disease-specific
and
all-cause
mortality
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Tobacco
Addiction
Group
trials
register
and
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
Date
of
the

Randomized
trials
of
smoking
cessation
advice
from
a
medical
practitioner
in
which
abstinence
was
assessed
at
least
six
months
after
advice
was
first
provided
We
extracted
data
in
duplicate
on
the
setting
in
which
advice
was
given
type
of
advice
given
(minimal
or
intensive)
and
whether
aids
to
advice
were
used
the
outcome
measures
method
of
randomization
and
completeness
of
follow
up
The
main
outcome
measures
were
abstinence
from
smoking
after
at
least
six
months
follow
up
and
mortality
We
used
the
most
rigorous
definition
of
abstinence
in
each
trial
and
biochemically
validated
rates
where
available
Subjects
lost
to
follow
up
were
counted
as
smokers
Where
possible
meta-analysis
was
performed
using
a
Mantel-Haenszel
fixed
effect
model
We
identified
39
trials
conducted
between
1972
and
2003
including
over
31000
smokers
In
some
trials
subjects
were
at
risk
of
specified
diseases
(chest
disease
diabetes
ischaemic
heart
disease)
but
most
were
from
unselected
populations
The
most
common
setting
for
delivery
of
advice
was
primary
care
Other
settings
included
hospital
wards
and
outpatient
clinics
and
industrial
clinics
Pooled
data
from
17
trials
of
brief
advice
versus
no
advice
(or
usual
care)
revealed
a
small
but
significant
increase
in
the
odds
of
quitting
(odds
ratio
174
95%
confidence
interval
148
to
205)
This
equates
to
an
absolute
difference
in
the
cessation
rate
of
about
25%
There
was
insufficient
evidence
from
indirect
comparisons
to
establish
a
significant
difference
in
the
effectiveness
of
physician
advice
according
to
the
intensity
of
the
intervention
the
amount
of
follow
up
provided
and
whether
or
not
various
aids
were
used
at
the
time
of
the
consultation
in
addition
to
providing
advice
Direct
comparison
of
intensive
versus
minimal
advice
showed
a
small
advantage
of
intensive
advice
(odds
ratio
144
95%
confidence
interval
124
to
167)
Direct
comparison
also
suggested
a
small
benefit
of
follow-up
visits
Only
one
study
determined
the
effect
of
smoking
advice
on
mortality
It
found
no
statistically
significant
differences
in
death
rates
at
20
years
follow
up
Simple
advice
has
a
small
effect
on
cessation
rates
Additional
manoeuvres
appear
to
have
only
a
small
effect
though
more
intensive
interventions
are
marginally
more
effective
than
minimal
interventions
