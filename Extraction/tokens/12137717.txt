Cow's
milk
protein
avoidance
and
development
of
childhood
wheeze
in
children
with
a
family
history
of
atopy
Abstract
Text
In
infants
with
a
family
history
of
atopy
food
allergen
avoidance
has
been
advocated
as
means
of
preventing
the
development
of
atopic
disease
when
breast-feeding
is
not
possible
or
supplemental
feeding
is
needed
Most
infant
formulas
are
based
on
cow's
milk
protein
Alternative
choices
include
soya
based
and
hydrolysed
cows
milk
formulas
To
estimate
the
effect
of
dietary
avoidance
of
cow's
milk
protein
on
the
development
of
asthma
or
wheeze
in
children
The
Cochrane
database
was
searched
for
eligible
trials
until
February
2002
The
full
text
papers
of
all
abstracts
identified
as
RCTs
were
obtained
and
reviewed
independently
by
two
reviewers
Randomised
controlled
trials
involving
children
with
a
family
history
of
atopy
in
at
least
one
first
degree
relative
were
considered
if
feeding
with
cow's
milk
based
standard
formula
was
compared
to
dietary
avoidance
of
cow's
milk
protein
using
soya
or
other
hypoallergenic
formula
during
the
initial
four
months
of
life
or
longer
Two
reviewers
extracted
data
independently
A
priori
defined
subgroups
were
the
types
of
hypoallergenic
artificial
feed
and
dietary
restrictions
on
mother
and/or
child's
diet
Six
trials
used
hydrolysed
formula
for
at
least
4
months
in
addition
to
dietary
restrictions
and
in
some
cases
dust-mite
reduction
measures
The
risk
of
infants
experiencing
asthma
or
wheeze
during
the
first
year
of
life
was
reduced
compared
to
standard
cow's
milk
based
formula
(Relative
Risk

Feeding
soya-based
formula
as
opposed
to
standard
cow's
milk
formula
did
not
reduce
the
risk
of
having
asthma
or
wheeze
at
any
age
Breast-milk
should
remain
the
feed
of
choice
for
all
babies
In
infants
with
at
least
one
first
degree
relative
with
atopy
hydrolysed
formula
for
a
minimum
of
4
months
combined
with
dietary
restrictions
and
environment
measures
may
reduce
the
risk
of
developing
asthma
or
wheeze
in
the
first
year
of
life
There
is
insufficient
evidence
to
suggest
that
soya-based
milk
formula
has
any
benefit
