Subclinical
hypothyroidism
is
an
independent
risk
factor
for
atherosclerosis
and
myocardial
infarction
in
elderly
women
the
Rotterdam
Study
Abstract
Text
Overt
hypothyroidism
has
been
found
to
be
associated
with
cardiovascular
disease
Whether
subclinical
hypothyroidism
and
thyroid
autoimmunity
are
also
risk
factors
for
cardiovascular
disease
is
controversial
To
investigate
whether
subclinical
hypothyroidism
and
thyroid
autoimmunity
are
associated
with
aortic
atherosclerosis
and
myocardial
infarction
in
postmenopausal
women
Population-based
cross-sectional
study
A
district
of
Rotterdam
The
Netherlands
Random
sample
of
1149
women
(mean
age
+/-
SD
690
+/-
75
years)
participating
in
the
Rotterdam
Study
Data
on
thyroid
status
aortic
atherosclerosis
and
history
of
myocardial
infarction
were
obtained
at
baseline
Subclinical
hypothyroidism
was
defined
as
an
elevated
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
level
(>40
mU/L)
and
a
normal
serum
free
thyroxine
level
(11
to
25
pmol/L
[09
to
19
ng/dL])
In
tests
for
antibodies
to
thyroid
peroxidase
a
serum
level
greater
than
10
IU/mL
was
considered
a
positive
result
Subclinical
hypothyroidism
was
present
in
108%
of
participants
and
was
associated
with
a
greater
age-adjusted
prevalence
of
aortic
atherosclerosis
(odds
ratio
17
[95%
CI
11
to
26])
and
myocardial
infarction
(odds
ratio
23
[CI
13
to
40])
Additional
adjustment
for
body
mass
index
total
and
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
level
blood
pressure
and
smoking
status
as
well
as
exclusion
of
women
who
took
beta-blockers
did
not
affect
these
estimates
Associations
were
slightly
stronger
in
women
who
had
subclinical
hypothyroidism
and
antibodies
to
thyroid
peroxidase
(odds
ratio
for
aortic
atherosclerosis
19
[CI
11
to
36]
odds
ratio
for
myocardial
infarction
31
[CI
15
to
63])
No
association
was
found
between
thyroid
autoimmunity
itself
and
cardiovascular
disease
The
population
attributable
risk
percentage
for
subclinical
hypothyroidism
associated
with
myocardial
infarction
was
within
the
range
of
that
for
known
major
risk
factors
for
cardiovascular
disease
Subclinical
hypothyroidism
is
a
strong
indicator
of
risk
for
atherosclerosis
and
myocardial
infarction
in
elderly
women
