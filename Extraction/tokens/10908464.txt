methotrexate
in

were

This

supplemented
by
manually

of
previously
published

conference

contacting
drug

and
referring
to
the
Cochrane
Clinical

All

were
included
in
the
initial

All

comparing

gold
azathioprine
and

in

Following
a
published

the
main
outcome
measures
included
individual
component
variables
derived
from

(OMERACT)
These
include
acute

[Tugwell

and

in

(DI)
Only
English
trials
were
included
in
the
review
Data
were
independently
extracted
from
the
published
reports
by
two
of
the
reviewers
(MC
GJ)
An
independent
blinded
quality
assessment
was
also
performed
Twenty
randomized
trials
were
identified
of
which
thirteen
were
included
in
the
quantitative
analysis
with
data
from
1022
subjects
Although
all
agents
were
better
than
placebo
parenteral
high
dose
methotrexate
(not
included)
salazopyrin
azathioprine
and
etretinate
were
the
agents
that
achieved
statistical
significance
in
a
global
index
of
disease
activity
(although
it
should
be
noted
that
only
one
component
variable
was
available
for
azathioprine
and
only
one
trial
was
available
for
etretinate
suggesting
some
caution
is
necessary
in
interpreting
these
results)
Analysis
of
response
in
individual
disease
activity
markers
was
more
variable
with
considerable
differences
between
different
medications
and
responses
In
all
trials
the
placebo
group
improved
over
baseline
(pooled
improvement
039
DI
units
95%
CI
026-054)
There
was
insufficient
data
to
examine
toxicity
Parenteral
high
dose
methotrexate
and
salazopyrin
are
the
only
two
agents
with
well
demonstrated
published
efficacy
in
psoriatic
arthritis
The
magnitude
of
the
effect
seen
with
azathioprine
etretinate
oral
low
dose
methotrexate
and
perhaps
colchicine
suggests
that
they
may
be
effective
but
that
further
multicentre
clinical
trials
are
required
to
establish
their
efficacy
Furthermore
the
magnitude
of
the
improvement
observed
in
the
placebo
group
strongly
suggests
that
uncontrolled
trials
should
not
be
used
to
guide
management
decisions
in
this
condition
