Cumulative
effects
associated
with
recurrent
concussion
in
collegiate
football
players
the
NCAA
Concussion
Study
Abstract
Text
Approximately
300
000
sport-related
concussions
occur
annually
in
the
United
States
and
the
likelihood
of
serious
sequelae
may
increase
with
repeated
head
injury
To
estimate
the
incidence
of
concussion
and
time
to
recovery
after
concussion
in
collegiate
football
players
Prospective
cohort
study
of
2905
football
players
from
25
US
colleges
were
tested
at
preseason
baseline
in
1999
2000
and
2001
on
a
variety
of
measures
and
followed
up
prospectively
to
ascertain
concussion
occurrence
Players
injured
with
a
concussion
were
monitored
until
their
concussion
symptoms
resolved
and
were
followed
up
for
repeat
concussions
until
completion
of
their
collegiate
football
career
or
until
the
end
of
the
2001
football
season
Incidence
of
concussion
and
repeat
concussion
type
and
duration
of
symptoms
and
course
of
recovery
among
players
who
were
injured
with
a
concussion
during
the
seasons
During
follow-up
of
4251
player-seasons
184
players
(63%)
had
a
concussion
and
12
(65%)
of
these
players
had
a
repeat
concussion
within
the
same
season
There
was
an
association
between
reported
number
of
previous
concussions
and
likelihood
of
incident
concussion
Players
reporting
a
history
of
3
or
more
previous
concussions
were
30
(95%
confidence
interval
16-56)
times
more
likely
to
have
an
incident
concussion
than
players
with
no
concussion
history
Headache
was
the
most
commonly
reported
symptom
at
the
time
of
injury
(852%)
and
mean
overall
symptom
duration
was
82
hours
Slowed
recovery
was
associated
with
a
history
of
multiple
previous
concussions
(300%
of
those
with
>
or
=3
previous
concussions
had
symptoms
lasting
>1
week
compared
with
146%
of
those
with
1
previous
concussion)
Of
the
12
incident
within-season
repeat
concussions
11
(917%)
occurred
within
10
days
of
the
first
injury
and
9
(750%)
occurred
within
7
days
of
the
first
injury
Our
study
suggests
that
players
with
a
history
of
previous
concussions
are
more
likely
to
have
future
concussive
injuries
than
those
with
no
history
1
in
15
players
with
a
concussion
may
have
additional
concussions
in
the
same
playing
season
and
previous
concussions
may
be
associated
with
slower
recovery
of
neurological
function
