Abstract
Text
The
accuracy
of
estimating
birth
weight
clinically
sonographically
(using
femur
length
and
abdominal
circumference)
and
by
maternal
prediction
was
studied
prospectively
in
106
term
parous
women
who
were
in
active
labor
Estimates
of
birth
weight
by
these
women
had
lower
standardized
error
(868
+/-
780
g/kg)
than
either
clinical
estimates
(902
+/-
848
g/kg)
or
sonographically
derived
estimates
(1558
+/-
1180
g/kg)
of
birth
weight
(P
=
not
significant)
Maternal
estimates
of
birth
weight
were
within
+/-
10%
of
the
actual
weight
in
698%
compared
with
661%
for
clinical
estimates
and
424%
for
sonography
A
term
parous
woman
in
labor
can
predict
the
birth
weight
with
accuracy
comparable
to
a
clinical
estimation
by
a
physician
or
a
sonographic
estimate
based
on
infant
measurements
