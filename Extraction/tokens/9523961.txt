Injection
accuracy
and
clinical
relief
of
de
Quervain's
tendinitis
Abstract
Text
In
a
controlled
prospective
double-blind
study
the
incidence
of
accurate
injection
of
the
abductor
pollicis
longus
(APL)
and
extensor
pollicis
brevis
(EPB)
tendon
compartments
was
defined
and
correlated
with
clinical
relief
of
de
Quervain's
tendinitis
X-ray
dye
was
included
with
steroid
and
lidocaine
injections
for
19
patients
dye
location
was
immediately
checked
by
1
radiologist
blinded
to
the
clinical
results
Dye
was
confirmed
to
be
within
the
first
dorsal
compartment
in
16
of
19
cases
There
was
relief
of
symptoms
in
11
of
19
patients
Four
of
5
patients
with
dye
in
both
the
APL
and
EPB
tendon
compartments
experienced
relief
of
symptoms
while
all
3
with
dye
in
neither
compartment
experienced
no
relief
This
suggests
that
accurate
injection
of
steroids
is
required
for
relief
of
de
Quervain's
tendinitis
The
EPB
compartment
was
often
missed
(13/19
cases)
possibly
because
it
was
separate
or
of
small
size
and
deep
location
This
may
be
a
factor
in
failed
injections
just
as
surgery
can
fail
if
a
separate
EPB
compartment
is
not
released
