Comparison
of
combination
of
cimetidine
and
levamisole
with
cimetidine
alone
in
the
treatment
of
recalcitrant
warts
Abstract
Text
Various
immunomodulating
agents
have
been
used
in
the
treatment
of
recalcitrant
warts
but
none
is
uniformly
effective
Drugs
like
cimetidine
and
levamisole
have
been
tried
with
varying
success
rates
Given
the
different
target
activities
of
immunomodulation
by
levamisole
and
cimetidine
we
questioned
whether
the
combination
might
be
more
effective
and
conducted
this
double-blind
comparative
trial
of
a
combination
of
cimetidine
and
levamisole
versus
cimetidine
alone
Forty-eight
patients
with
multiple
recalcitrant
warts
were
assigned
to
two
treatment
groups
(A
and
B)
in
double-blind
fashion
Of
the
48
patients
22
in
group
A
and
21
in
group
B
were
able
to
be
evaluated
At
the
end
of
therapy
cure
rates
obtained
were
455%
(10/21)
in
cimetidine
treated
patients
(group
A)
and
857%
(18/21)
in
combination
treated
patients
(group
B)
A
statistically
significant
improvement
was
seen
in
patients
treated
with
the
combination
of
levamisole
and
cimetidine
(P
<
001)
A
similar
statistically
significant
result
was
obtained
on
using
intention
to
treat
analysis
(P
<
002)
The
rate
of
regression
was
faster
in
group
B
(average
regression
period
of
7
weeks
compared
with
10
weeks
in
group
A)
The
present
study
demonstrated
that
the
combination
of
cimetidine
with
levamisole
is
more
effective
than
cimetidine
alone
and
is
a
highly
effective
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
recalcitrant
warts
