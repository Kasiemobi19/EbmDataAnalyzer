Title
Intensity
of
exercise
for
the
treatment
of
osteoarthritis
Abstract
Text
Therapeutic
exercise
is
used
as
one
modality
to
treat
people
with
osteoarthritis
(OA)
To
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
therapeutic
exercise
of
differing
intensities
on
objective
and
subjective
measures
of
disease
activity
in
people
with
OA
We

The
Cochrane
Field
of
Rehabilitation
and
Related
Therapies
and
the
Cochrane
Musculoskeletal
Review
Group
were
also
contacted
for
a
search
of
their
specialized
registers
Handsearching
was
conducted
on
all
retrieved
articles
for
additional
studies
Comparative
controlled
studies
such
as
randomized
controlled
trials
controlled
clinical
trials
cohort
studies
or
case/control
studies
of
therapeutic
exercises
compared
to
control
or
active
interventions
in
people
with
OA
were
eligible
No
language
restrictions
were
applied
Abstracts
were
also
accepted
Two
independent
reviewers
identified
potential
articles
from
the
literature
search
These
reviewers
extracted
data
using
pre-defined
extraction
forms
Consensus
was
reached
on
all
data
extraction
The
two
reviewers
used
a
five
point
scale
to
assess
the
quality
of
the
selected
articles
Randomization
double-blinding
and
description
of
withdrawals
were
assessed
One
study
involving
39
participants
met
the
inclusion
criteria
The
review
indicates
that
there
were
no
significant
differences
between
high
intensity
and
low
intensity
aerobic
exercise
on
participants
with
OA
of
the
knee
for
functional
status
gait
pain
and
aerobic
capacity
(Mangione
1999)
Both
high
intensity
and
low
intensity
aerobic
exercise
appear
to
be
equally
effective
in
improving
a
patient's
functional
status
gait
pain
and
aerobic
capacity
for
people
with
OA
of
the
knee
Further
research
involving
a
greater
number
of
subjects
and
a
larger
number
of
studies
involving
a
control
group
is
needed
to
further
substantiate
these
results
