Title
The
effect
of
mobilisation
of
patients
during
treatment
of
thromboembolic
disorders
with
low-molecular-weight
heparin
Abstract
Text
To
elucidate
the
risk
of
pulmonary
embolism
(PE)
in
patients
with
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
who
are
kept
walking
with
compression
bandages
Perfusion/ventilation
scanning
of
the
lungs
was
performed
at
admission
and
after
10
days
of
treatment
General
community
hospital
A
total
of
631
consecutive
patients
were
studied
(upper
limit
of
the
thrombi
iliofemoral
vein
n=212
femoral
or
popliteal
vein
n=302
lower
leg
n=117)
The
patients
received
different
dose
regimens
of
low-molecular-weight
heparin
(dalteparin)
subcutaneously
The
study
revealed
that
the
prevalence
of
PE
at
baseline
was
between
451%
and
51%
(95%
CI
382-552
and
452-568%
respectively)
in
patients
with
proximal
DVT
and
319%
(95%
CI
236-412%)
in
those
with
DVT
restricted
to
the
lower
leg
The
majority
of
these
cases
of
PE
were
completely
asymptomatic
The
incidence
of
a
new
PE
revealed
by
a
second
lung
scan
on
day
10
after
admission
was
70%
(95%
CI
39-114%)
in
patients
with
iliofemoral
DVT
55%
(95%
CI
32-87%)
in
those
with
femoropopliteal
DVT
and
27%
(95%
CI
06-76%)
in
those
with
lower-leg
DVT
These
incidence
rates
for
new
PEs
were
significantly
lower
than
the
rates
previously
reported
(p<001)
The
fatality
rate
was
also
lower
compared
with
the
literature
one
patient
suffered
a
fatal
PE
(02%
95%
CI
0-09%)
four
patients
died
from
malignant
tumours
and
one
from
pneumonia
The
frequency
of
malignant
tumours
was
greater
in
this
study
than
in
the
literature
(23%
in
patients
with
iliofemoral
DVT
14%
in
those
with
femoropopliteal
DVT
and
9%
in
those
with
DVT
of
the
lower
leg)
Mobile
patients
with
DVT
do
not
need
bed-rest
Low-molecular-weight
heparin
sc
compression
bandages
and
walking
exercises
make
home-treatment
of
DVT
feasible
