Douching
in
relation
to
bacterial
vaginosis
lactobacilli
and
facultative
bacteria
in
the
vagina
Abstract
Text
To
study
how
frequency
recentness
and
reason
for
douching
impact
bacterial
vaginosis-related
vaginal
microflora
and
the
occurrence
of
cervical
pathogens
Douching
has
been
linked
to
bacterial
vaginosis
as
well
as
to
chlamydial
cervicitis
in
some
but
not
all
studies
A
total
of
1200
women
at
high
risk
for
sexually
transmitted
infections
were
enrolled
from
five
clinical
sites
around
the
United
States
Cross-sectional
structured
interviews
were
conducted
and
vaginal
swabs
were
self-obtained
for
Gram
stain
culture
and
DNA
amplification
tests
for
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
and
Chlamydia
trachomatis
Douching
at
least
once
per
month
was
associated
with
an
increased
frequency
of
bacterial
vaginosis
Those
who
douched
recently
(within
7
days)
were
at
highest
risk

Douching

and
for
hygiene
(OR

both
related
to
bacterial
vaginosis
risk
The
associations
between
douching
and
Gardnerella
vaginalis
Mycoplasma
hominis
and
lack
of
hydrogen
peroxide-producing
lactobacilli
were
similar
to
those
between
douching
and
bacterial
vaginosis
Gonococcal
or
chlamydial
cervicitis
was
not
associated
with
douching
Douching
for
symptoms
or
hygiene
particularly
frequent
or
recent
douching
was
associated
with
bacterial
vaginosis
and
bacterial
vaginosis-associated
vaginal
microflora
but
not
with
gonococcal
or
chlamydial
cervicitis
