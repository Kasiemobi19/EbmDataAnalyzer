Effect
of
splitting
simvastatin
tablets
for
control
of
low-density

cholesterol
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
safety
and
economics
of
a
voluntary
conversion
from
whole
simvastatin
tablets
to
split
tablets
in
6
Veterans
Affairs
medical
centers
were
retrospectively
evaluated
in
3787
patients
who
received
a
consistent
daily
dose
(5
to
40
mg)
of
simvastatin
in
1999
Baseline
and
final
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
and
average
change
from
baseline
were
not
significantly
different
between
groups
(p
>005)
nor
were
the
incidence
of
transaminase
increases
(p
>005)
or
measurements
of
patient
compliance
(p
=
007)
Widespread
implementation
of
this
initiative
resulted
in
a
cost
avoidance
of
>$12
million
in
the
6
medical
centers
and
$103
million
across
the
Veterans
Affairs
medical
system
in
1999
with
>$46
million
avoided
in
2003
