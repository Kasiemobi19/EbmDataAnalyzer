Abstract
Text
The
value
of
screening
for
ovarian
cancer
is
uncertain
We
did
a
pilot
randomised
trial
to
assess
multimodal
screening
with
sequential
CA
125
antigen
and
ultrasonography
Postmenopausal
women
aged
45
years
or
older
were
randomised
to
a
control
group
(n=10977)
or
screened
group
(n=10958)
Women
randomised
to
screening
were
offered
three
annual
screens
that
involved
measurement
of
serum
CA
125
pelvic
ultrasonography
if
CA
125
was
30
U/mL
or
more
and
referral
for
gynaecological
opinion
if
ovarian
volume
was
88
mL
or
more
on
ultrasonography
All
women
were
followed
up
to
see
whether
they
developed
invasive
epithelial
cancers
of
the
ovary
or
fallopian
tube
(index
cancers)
Of
468
women
in
the
screened
group
with
a
raised
CA
125
29
were
referred
for
a
gynaecological
opinion
screening
detected
an
index
cancer
in
six
and
23
had
false-positive
screening
results
The
positive
predictive
value
was
207%
During
7-year
follow-up
ten
further
women
with
index
cancers
were
identified
in
the
screened
group
and
20
in
the
control
group
Median
survival
of
women
with
index
cancers
in
the
screened
group
was
729
months
and
in
the
control
group
was
418
months
(p=00112)
The
number
of
deaths
from
an
index
cancer
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
control
and
screened
groups
(18
of
10977
vs
nine
of
10958
relative
risk
20
[95%
CI
078-513])
These
results
show
that
a
multimodal
approach
to
ovarian
cancer
screening
in
a
randomised
trial
is
feasible
and
justify
a
larger
randomised
trial
to
see
whether
screening
affects
mortality
