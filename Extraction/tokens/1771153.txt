Title
Electroconvulsive
therapy
in
the
treatment-resistant
patient
Abstract
Text
In
medication-resistant
patients
with
major
depressive
disorder
the
response
rate
with
bilateral
electroconvulsive
therapy
(ECT)
drops
to
50%
from
the
expected
range
of
80%
to
90%
Relapse
rates
following
ECT
are
high
in
medication-resistant
depressed
patients
and
are
clustered
in
the
first
4
months
following
clinical
response
Medication
resistance
during
the
index
episode
predicts
a
high
rate
of
relapse
whereas
those
patients
who
have
not
received
an
adequate
medication
trial
prior
to
ECT
are
less
likely
to
relapse
If
a
patient
who
fails
an
antidepressant
trial
then
responds
to
a
course
of
ECT
alternative
pharmacologic
strategies
or
maintenance
ECT
should
be
considered
to
decrease
the
likelihood
of
relapse
Patients
who
do
not
respond
to
a
traditional
course
of
bilateral
ECT
may
respond
subsequently
to
longer
courses
of
bilateral
ECT
at
markedly
suprathreshold
stimulus
intensity
or
may
respond
to
a
different
class
of
antidepressant
medication
from
that
which
they
failed
previously
