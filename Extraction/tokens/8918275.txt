Abstract
Text
Many
clinical
trials
have
evaluated
the
benefit
of
long-term
use
of
antiplatelet
drugs
in
reducing
the
risk
of
clinical
thrombotic
events
Aspirin
and
ticlopidine
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
but
both
have
potentially
serious
adverse
effects
Clopidogrel
a
new
thienopyridine
derivative
similar
to
ticlopidine
is
an
inhibitor
of
platelet
aggregation
induced
by
adenosine
diphosphate
CAPRIE
was
a
randomised
blinded
international
trial
designed
to
assess
the
relative
efficacy
of
clopidogrel
(75
mg
once
daily)
and
aspirin
(325
mg
once
daily)
in
reducing
the
risk
of
a
composite
outcome
cluster
of
ischaemic
stroke
myocardial
infarction
or
vascular
death
their
relative
safety
was
also
assessed
The
population
studied
comprised
subgroups
of
patients
with
atherosclerotic
vascular
disease
manifested
as
either
recent
ischaemic
stroke
recent
myocardial
infarction
or
symptomatic
peripheral
arterial
disease
Patients
were
followed
for
1
to
3
years
19185
patients
with
more
than
6300
in
each
of
the
clinical
subgroups
were
recruited
over
3
years
with
a
mean
follow-up
of
191
years
There
were
1960
first
events
included
in
the
outcome
cluster
on
which
an
intention-to-treat
analysis
showed
that
patients
treated
with
clopidogrel
had
an
annual
532%
risk
of
ischaemic
stroke
myocardial
infarction
or
vascular
death
compared
with
583%
with
aspirin
These
rates
reflect
a
statistically
significant
(p
=
0043)
relative-risk
reduction
of
87%
in
favour
of
clopidogrel
(95%
Cl
03-165)
Corresponding
on-treatment
analysis
yielded
a
relative-risk
reduction
of
94%
There
were
no
major
differences
in
terms
of
safety
Reported
adverse
experiences
in
the
clopidogrel
and
aspirin
groups
judged
to
be
severe
included
rash
(026%
vs
010%)
diarrhoea
(023%
vs
011%)
upper
gastrointestinal
discomfort
(097%
vs
122%)
intracranial
haemorrhage
(033%
vs
047%)
and
gastrointestinal
haemorrhage
(052%
vs
072%)
respectively
There
were
ten
(010%)
patients
in
the
clopidogrel
group
with
significant
reductions
in
neutrophils
(<
12
x
10(9)/L)
and
16
(017%)
in
the
aspirin
group
Long-term
administration
of
clopidogrel
to
patients
with
atherosclerotic
vascular
disease
is
more
effective
than
aspirin
in
reducing
the
combined
risk
of
ischaemic
stroke
myocardial
infarction
or
vascular
death
The
overall
safety
profile
of
clopidogrel
is
at
least
as
good
as
that
of
medium-dose
aspirin
