Retrospective
analysis
of
calls
to
poison
control
centers
resulting
from
exposure
to
the
insect
repellent
NN-diethyl-m-toluamide
(DEET)
from
1985-1989
Abstract
Text
This
study
analyzed
9086
human
exposures
involving
NN-diethyl-m-toluamide--containing
insect
repellents
that
were
reported
to
Poison
Control
Centers
from
1985-1989
Nearly
two-thirds
of
those
exposed
had
no
adverse
effects
or
only
experienced
minor
symptoms
that
resolved
rapidly
Symptoms
were
more
likely
to
occur
after
ocular
or
inhalation
exposures
and
least
likely
to
occur
if
the
product
was
ingested
The
only
reported
death
occurred
in
a
patient
who
suicidally
ingested
8
oz
of
an
insect
repellent
containing
NN-diethyl-m-toluamide
Five
patients
may
have
experienced
a
serious
or
potentially
life-threatening
effect
but
the
poison
center
record
did
not
provide
unequivocal
substantiation
of
the
effect
or
clearly
establish
NN-diethyl-m-toluamide
as
the
causative
agent
From
the
analysis
of
those
patients
calling
Poison
Control
Centers
it
appears
the
risk
of
serious
medical
effects
with
the
labeled
use
of
NN-diethyl-m-toluamide-containing
insect
repellents
is
low
in
comparison
with
its
reported
annual
use
by
about
30%
of
Americans
For
patients
contacting
Poison
Control
Centers
the
occurrence
of
adverse
effects
appears
to
be
related
to
the
route
of
exposure
rather
than
age
or
gender
of
the
patient
or
the
concentration
of
NN-diethyl-m-toluamide
in
the
product
