Abstract
Text
Patients
with
insomnia
may
experience
one
or
more
of
the
following
problems
difficulty
falling
asleep
difficulty
maintaining
sleep
waking
up
too
early
in
the
morning
and
nonrefreshing
sleep
In
addition
daytime
consequences
such
as
fatigue
lack
of
energy
difficulty
concentrating
and
irritability
are
often
present
Approximately
10
percent
of
adults
experience
persistent
insomnia
although
most
patients
do
not
mention
it
during
routine
office
visits
Asking
sleep-related
questions
during
the
general
review
of
systems
and
asking
patients
with
sleep
complaints
to
keep
a
sleep
diary
are
helpful
approaches
in
detecting
insomnia
Behavior
and
pharmacologic
therapies
are
used
in
treating
insomnia
Behavior
approaches
take
a
few
weeks
to
improve
sleep
but
continue
to
provide
relief
even
after
training
sessions
have
ended
Hypnotic
medications
are
safe
and
effective
in
inducing
maintaining
and
consolidating
sleep
Effective
treatment
of
insomnia
may
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
many
patients
