Neuromodulators

Abstract
Text
Migraine
is
a
debilitating
condition
characterized
by
a
cycle
of
painful
headaches
and
headache-related
symptoms
interspersed
with
periods
of
worry
distress
and
apprehension
The
negative
impact
of
migraine
on
patient
functioning
workplace
productivity
and
other
daily
activities
has
been
demonstrated
through
the
use
of
a
variety
of
clinician-
and
patient-reported
assessment
tools
including
the
Migraine-Specific
Questionnaire
and
the
Migraine
Disability
Assessment
questionnaire
In
addition
to
considering
the
frequency
and
severity
of
migraine
clinicians
need
to
encourage
more
open
dialogue
with
their
patients
about
the
impact
of
this
disorder
on
daily
activities
and
productivity
Only
then
can
the
most
appropriate
course
of
treatment
be
determined
Appropriately
prescribed
acute
and
preventive
therapies
should
break
the
cycle
of
migraine
and
improve
the
daily
activities
of
patients
with
this
chronic
condition
Divalproex
sodium
and
topiramate
are
neuromodulators
that
are
approved
by
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
for
the
prophylaxis
(prevention)
of
migraine
headache
in
adults
Non-FDA-approved
neuromodulators
sometimes
used
in
the
management
of
migraine
headache
include
gabapentin
lamotrigine
levetiracetam
and
zonisamide
All
medications
need
to
be
titrated
and
treatment-related
adverse
events
need
to
be
managed
appropriately
Preventive
medications
should
be
taken
for
at
least
2-3
months
to
ascertain
their
therapeutic
effect
