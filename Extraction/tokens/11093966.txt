A
multicentre
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
of
naltrexone
in
the
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
or
abuse
Abstract
Text
The
opioid
antagonist
naltrexone
is
reported
in
single
centre
studies
to
improve
the
clinical
outcome
of
individuals
with
alcohol
dependence
participating
in
outpatient
psychosocial
programmes
This
is
the
first
multicentre
controlled
study
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
naltrexone
as
adjunctive
treatment
for
alcohol
dependence
or
abuse
Patients
who
met
criteria
for
alcohol
dependence
(n
=
169)
or
alcohol
abuse
(n
=
6)
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
double-blind
oral
naltrexone
50
mg
daily
(n
=
90)
or
placebo
(n
=
85)
for
12
weeks
as
an
adjunct
to
psychosocial
treatment
The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
time
to
first
episode
of
heavy
drinking
secondary
efficacy
assessments
included
time
to
first
drink
alcohol
consumption
craving
and
changes
in
the
serum
biological
markers
gamma-glutamyl
transferase
(GGT)
and
aspartate
and
alanine
aminotransferases
Compliance
was
assessed
by
tablet
counts
and
in
the
naltrexone-treated
group
by
measurement
of
urinary
concentrations
of
6-ss-naltrexol
Forty-nine
(58%)
patients
randomized
to
placebo
and
53
(59%)
randomized
to
naltrexone
did
not
complete
the
study
In
intention-to-treat
analyses
there
was
no
difference
between
groups
on
measures
of
drinking
The
median
reduction
from
baseline
of
serum
GGT
(P
<
005)
and
the
reductions
in
alcohol
craving
(Obsessive
and
Compulsive
Drinking
Scale
OCDS)
were
greater
in
the
naltrexone
group
(P
<
005)
from
approximately
half-way
through
the
study
Of
70
patients
(35
placebo
35
naltrexone)
who
met
an
a
priori
definition
of
compliance
(80%
tablet
consumption
attendance
at
all
follow-up
appointments)
those
allocated
to
naltrexone
reported
consuming
half
the
amount
of
alcohol
(P
<
005)
had
greater
median
reduction
in
serum
GGT
activity
(P
<
005)
and
greater
reduction
in
alcohol
craving
(OCDS
total
score
P
<
005
Obsessive
subscale
score
P
<
005)
compared
to
patients
in
the
placebo
group
Use
of
naltrexone
raised
no
safety
concerns
Naltrexone
is
effective
in
treating
alcohol
dependence/abuse
in
conjunction
with
psychosocial
therapy
in
patients
who
comply
with
treatment
