Early
determinants
of
childhood
overweight
and
adiposity
in
a
birth
cohort
study
role
of
breast-feeding
Abstract
Text
The
prevalence
of
adiposity
in
childhood
is
increasing
Is
breast-feeding
protective
as
suggested
by
cross-sectional
studies
In
a
longitudinal
birth
cohort
study
we
tested
whether
breast-feeding
for
more
than
2
months
has
preventive
effects
against
overweight
and
adiposity
at
6
y
Of
1314
children
representing
the
catchment
areas
of
six
delivery
units
918
could
be
followed
up
to
the
age
of
6
y
Height
weight
and
skin-fold
thickness
were
measured
at
regular
visits
As
the
criteria
of
overweight
obesity
and
adiposity
in
the
children
the
90th
and
the
97th
percentiles
of
BMI
and
skin-fold
values
were
used
Parents
with
a
BMI
at
or
above
the
90th
percentile
which
was
27
kg/m(2)
or
more
were
considered
overweight
Infants
bottle-fed
from
birth
or
breast-fed
for
less
than
3
months
were
classified
as
'bottle-fed'
(BO)
and
those
breast-fed
for
3
months
and
more
as
'breast-fed'
(BR)
Univariate
comparisons
and
logistic
regression
analysis
were
performed
applying
SAS
612
The
final
logistic
model
consisted
of
the
480
cases
for
whom
complete
data
for
all
variables
were
available
The
potential
effect
of
loss
to
follow-up
was
analysed
by
the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel
test
the
outcomes
were
not
significantly
influenced
by
loss
to
follow-up
At
birth
BMIs
were
nearly
identical
in
both
groups
By
3
months
BO
had
significantly
higher
BMIs
and
thicker
skin
folds
than
BR
From
6
months
on
compared
to
BR
a
consistently
higher
proportion
of
BO
children
exceeded
the
90th
and
the
97th
percentile
of
BMI
and
skin-fold
thickness
reference
values
From
the
age
of
4
y
to
5
and
6
y
in
BO
the
prevalence
of
obesity
nearly
doubled
and
tripled
respectively
With
only
minor
changes
of
obesity
prevalence
in
BR
the
difference
of
BMI
and
skin-fold
thickness
between
groups
became
statistically
significant
Logistic
regression
analysis
revealed
that
overweight
of
the
mother
maternal
smoking
during
pregnancy
bottle
feeding
and
low
social
status
remained
important
risk
factors
for
overweight
and
adiposity
at
6
y
of
age
A
maternal
BMI
of
>
or
=27
bottle-feeding
maternal
smoking
during
pregnancy
and
low
social
status
are
risk
factors
for
overweight
and
adiposity
at
6
y
of
age
Early
bottle-feeding
brings
forward
the
obesity
rebound
predictive
of
obesity
in
later
life
