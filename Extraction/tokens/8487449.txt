Abstract
Text
To
model
the
impact
of
initial
therapy
on
outcomes
for
men
with
localized
(clinical
stage
A
or
B)
prostatic
carcinoma
A
decision
analysis
modeling
three
strategies
radical
prostatectomy
external-beam
radiation
therapy
and
watchful
waiting
with
delayed
hormonal
therapy
if
metastatic
disease
develops
We
modeled
the
main
benefit
of
treatment
as
a
reduction
in
the
chance
of
death
or
disutility
from
metastatic
disease
These
benefits
were
offset
in
the
model
by
the
risks
of
treatment-related
morbidity
and
mortality
The
model
was
used
to
analyze
expected
outcomes
by
tumor
grade
(well
moderately
and
poorly
differentiated)
for
men
60
to
75
years
of
age
Probabilities
and
rates
for
important
clinical
events
obtained
through
review
of
the
literature
for
prostatic
carcinoma
and
analysis
of
Medicare
claims
data
Several
patterns
emerged
within
the
range
of
uncertainty
about
the
risks
and
benefits
of
treatment
for
prostatic
carcinoma
In
patients
with
well-differentiated
tumor
grades
based
on
clinical
staging
treatment
at
best
offers
limited
benefit
in
terms
of
quality-adjusted
life
expectancy
and
may
result
in
harm
to
the
patient
Among
patients
with
moderately
or
poorly
differentiated
tumors
if
we
use
the
most
optimistic
assumptions
about
treatment
efficacy
then
patients
aged
60
to
65
years
would
benefit
from
either
radical
prostatectomy
or
external-beam
radiation
therapy
compared
with
watchful
waiting
However
in
most
other
cases
treatment
offers
less
than
a
1-year
improvement
in
quality-adjusted
life
expectancy
or
decreases
the
quality-adjusted
life
expectancy
compared
with
watchful
waiting
Invasive
treatment
generally
appears
to
be
harmful
for
patients
older
than
70
years
Radical
prostatectomy
and
radiation
therapy
may
benefit
selected
groups
of
patients
with
localized
prostate
cancer
particularly
younger
patients
with
higher-grade
tumors
However
our
model
shows
that
in
most
cases
the
potential
benefits
of
therapy
are
small
enough
that
the
choice
of
therapy
is
sensitive
to
the
patient's
preferences
for
various
outcomes
and
discounting
The
choice
of
watchful
waiting
is
a
reasonable
alternative
to
invasive
treatment
for
many
men
with
localized
prostatic
carcinoma
