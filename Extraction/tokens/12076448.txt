Title
Tricyclic
drugs
for
depression
in
children
and
adolescents
Abstract
Text
There
is
a
need
to
identify
effective
and
safe
treatments
for
depression
in
children
and
adolescents
While
tricyclic
drugs
are
effective
in
treating
depression
in
adults
individual
studies
involving
children
and
adolescents
have
been
equivocal
To
assess
the
effects
of
oral
tricyclic
antidepressants
compared
to
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
child
and
adolescent
depression
We
searched
MEDLINE
(1966-1997)
EMBASE
Excerpta
Medica
(June
1974-1997)
the
Cochrane
Collaboration
Depression
Anxiety
and
Neurosis
Group
trials
register
(most
recent
search

and
bibliographies
of
previously
published
reviews
and
papers
describing
original
research
were
cross-checked
Current
Contents
was
screened
for
recent
publications
We
contacted
authors
of
relevant
abstracts
in
conference
proceedings
of
the
American
Academy
of
Child
and
Adolescent
Psychiatry
and
we
hand
searched
the
Journal
of
the
American
Academy
of
Child
and
Adolescent
Psychiatry
(1978-1999)
Randomised
controlled
trials
comparing
the
efficacy
of
orally
administered
tricyclic
medication
with
placebo
in
depressed
people
aged
6-18
years
Most
studies
reported
multiple
outcome
measures
including
depression
scales
and
clinical
global
impression
scales
For
each
study
the
best
available
depression
measure
was
taken
as
the
index
measure
of
depression
outcome
Predetermined
criteria
were
established
to
assist
in
the
ranking
of
measures
Where
authors
reported
categorical
outcomes
we
calculated
individual
and
pooled
odds
ratios
for
the
odds
of
improvement
in
treated
compared
with
control
subjects
For
continuous
outcomes
pooled
effect
sizes
were
calculated
as
the
number
of
standard
deviations
by
which
the
change
in
depression
scores
for
the
treatment
group
exceeded
those
for
the
control
groups
Thirteen
trials
(involving
506
participants)
were
included
No
overall
improvement
with
treatment
compared
to
placebo
was
seen
for
children
or
adolescents
(odds
ratio
=
084
95%
confidence
interval
056
to
125)
A
statistically
significant
but
small
benefit
of
treatment
over
placebo
was
seen
in
reducing
symptoms
(effect
size
(standardised
mean
difference)
=
-031
95%
confidence
interval
-062
to
-001)
Subgroup
analyses
suggest
a
larger
benefit
among
adolescents
(effect
size
=
-047
95%
confidence
interval
-092
to
-002)
and
no
benefit
among
children
(effect
size
=
015
95%
confidence
interval
-034
to
064)
Treatment
with
a
tricyclic
antidepressant
caused
more
vertigo
(odds
ratio
=
438
95%
confidence
interval
233
to
825)
orthostatic
hypotension
(odds
ratio
=
678
95%
confidence
interval
206
to
2226)
tremor
(odds
ratio
629
95%
confidence
interval
178
to
2217)
and
dry
mouth
(odds
ratio
=
517
95%
confidence
interval
268
to
2999)
than
did
placebo
but
no
statistically
significant
difference
was
found
for
other
possible
adverse
effects
Data
suggest
tricyclic
antidepressants
are
not
useful
in
treating
depression
in
pre
pubertal
children
There
is
marginal
evidence
to
support
the
use
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
in
the
treatment
of
depression
in
adolescents
although
the
magnitude
of
effect
is
likely
to
be
moderate
at
best
