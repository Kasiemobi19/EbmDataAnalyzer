Effects
of
a
new
type
of
5-HT
receptor
agonist
on
male
rat
sexual
behavior
Abstract
Text
8-Methoxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)
tetralin
(8-OMe-DPAT)
and
8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)
tetralin
(8-OH-DPAT)
are
two
new
drugs
exerting
selective
actions
on
brain
5-HT
neurotransmission
In
the
present
experiments
we
have
investigated
the
effects
of
these
two
drugs
on
male
rat
sexual
behavior
It
was
found
that
both
drugs
reduce
the
number
of
intromissions
preceding
ejaculation
and
shorten
the
ejaculation
latency
These
effects
are
extremely
pronounced
and
several
animals
ejaculate
at
the
first
intromission
In
addition
8-OH-DPAT
produced
a
slight
reduction
of
the
post-ejaculatory
interval
There
were
no
significant
effects
on
latency
to
initiate
copulation
or
in
the
number
of
mounts
preceding
ejaculation
Finally
sexual
behavior
was
partly
or
completely
restored
in
castrated
male
rats
after
injection
with
8-OMe-DPAT
or
8-OH-DPAT
