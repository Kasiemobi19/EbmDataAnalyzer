Loss
of
bone
density
with
inhaled
triamcinolone
in
Lung
Health
Study
II
Abstract
Text
Inhaled
glucocorticosteroids
(ICS)
are
commonly
prescribed
for
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
No
adverse
effect
on
bone
mineral
density
(BMD)
has
been
proven
In
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
at
seven
centers
in
North
America
we
recruited
412
current
smokers
or
recent
quitters
with
mild
to
moderate
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
They
used
inhaled
triamcinolone
acetonide
600
mcg
or
placebo
twice
daily
We
measured
femoral
neck
and
lumbar
spine
BMD
at
baseline
and
after
1
and
3
years
and
serum
osteocalcin
at
baseline
3
months
1
year
and
3
years
After
3
years
BMD
at
the
femoral
neck
decreased
178%
more
with
ICS
than
with
placebo
(p
<
0001)
More
participants
in
the
ICS
group
experienced
6%
or
more
loss
of
femoral
neck
BMD
(p
=
0002)
Lumbar
spine
BMD
increased
in
the
placebo
group
by
098%
but
decreased
by
035%
in
the
ICS
group
(a
difference
of
133%
p
=
0007)
Changes
in
osteocalcin
did
not
correlate
with
changes
in
BMD
Fractures
lost
height
or
osteoporosis
diagnoses
were
not
increased
among
ICS
users
compared
with
placebo
users
In
summary
the
use
of
inhaled
triamcinolone
acetonide
was
associated
with
loss
of
BMD
at
the
femoral
neck
and
lumbar
spine
after
3
years
of
treatment
