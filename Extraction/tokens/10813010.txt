Title
Development
and
validation
of
the
Osteoporosis
Risk
Assessment
Instrument
to
facilitate
selection
of
women
for
bone
densitometry
Abstract
Text
Although
mass
screening
for
osteoporosis
is
not
recommended
among
postmenopausal
women
there
is
no
consensus
on
which
women
should
undergo
testing
for
low
bone
mineral
density
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
develop
and
validate
a
clinical
tool
to
help
clinicians
identify
which
women
are
at
increased
risk
for
osteoporosis
and
should
therefore
undergo
further
testing
with
bone
densitometry
Using
Ontario
baseline
data
from
the
Canadian
Multicentre
Osteoporosis
Study
we
identified
all
cognitively
normal
women
aged
45
years
or
more
who
had
undergone
testing
with
dual-energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
(DXA)
at
both
the
femoral
neck
and
the
lumbar
spine
(L1-L4)
Participants
who
had
a
previous
diagnosis
of
osteoporosis
or
were
taking
bone
active
medication
other
than
ovarian
hormones
were
excluded
The
main
outcome
measure
was
low
bone
mineral
density
(T
score
of
2
or
more
standard
deviations
below
the
mean
for
young
Canadian
women)
at
either
the
femoral
neck
or
the
lumbar
spine
Logistic
regression
analysis
and
receiver
operating
characteristic
(ROC)
analysis
were
used
to
identify
the
simplest
algorithm
that
would
identify
women
at
increased
risk
for
low
bone
mineral
density
The
study
population
comprised
1376
women
of
whom
926
were
allocated
to
the
development
of
the
tool
and
450
to
its
validation
A
simple
algorithm
based
on
age
weight
and
current
estrogen
use
(yes
or
no)
was
developed
Validation
of
this
3-item
Osteoporosis
Risk
Assessment
Instrument
(ORAI)
showed
that
the
tool
had
a
sensitivity
of
933%
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
863%-970%)
and
a
specificity
of
464%
(95%
CI
410%-518%)
for
selecting
women
with
low
bone
mineral
density
The
sensitivity
of
the
instrument
for
selecting
women
with
osteoporosis
was
944%
(95%
CI
837%-986%)
Use
of
the
ORAI
represented
a
387%
reduction
in
DXA
testing
compared
with
screening
all
women
in
our
study
The
ORAI
accurately
identifies
the
vast
majority
of
women
likely
to
have
low
bone
mineral
density
and
is
effective
in
substantially
decreasing
the
need
for
all
women
to
undergo
DXA
testing
