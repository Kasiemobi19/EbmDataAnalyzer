Nut
corn
and
popcorn
consumption
and
the
incidence
of
diverticular
disease
Abstract
Text
Patients
with
diverticular
disease
are
frequently
advised
to
avoid
eating
nuts
corn
popcorn
and
seeds
to
reduce
the
risk
of
complications
However
there
is
little
evidence
to
support
this
recommendation
To
determine
whether
nut
corn
or
popcorn
consumption
is
associated
with
diverticulitis
and
diverticular
bleeding
The
Health
Professionals
Follow-up
Study
is
a
cohort
of
US
men
followed
up
prospectively
from
1986
to
2004
via
self-administered
questionnaires
about
medical
(biennial)
and
dietary
(every
4
years)
information
Men
reporting
newly
diagnosed
diverticulosis
or
diverticulitis
were
mailed
supplemental
questionnaires
The
study
included
47228
men
aged
40
to
75
years
who
at
baseline
were
free
of
diverticulosis
or
its
complications
cancer
and
inflammatory
bowel
disease
and
returned
a
food-frequency
questionnaire
Incident
diverticulitis
and
diverticular
bleeding
During
18
years
of
follow-up
there
were
801
incident
cases
of
diverticulitis
and
383
incident
cases
of
diverticular
bleeding
We
found
inverse
associations
between
nut
and
popcorn
consumption
and
the
risk
of
diverticulitis
The
multivariate
hazard
ratios
for
men
with
the
highest
intake
of
each
food
(at
least
twice
per
week)
compared
with
men
with
the
lowest
intake
(less
than
once
per
month)
were
080
(95%
confidence
interval
063-101
P
for
trend
=
04)
for
nuts
and
072
(95%
confidence
interval
056-092
P
for
trend
=
007)
for
popcorn
No
associations
were
seen
between
corn
consumption
and
diverticulitis
or
between
nut
corn
or
popcorn
consumption
and
diverticular
bleeding
or
uncomplicated
diverticulosis
In
this
large
prospective
study
of
men
without
known
diverticular
disease
nut
corn
and
popcorn
consumption
did
not
increase
the
risk
of
diverticulosis
or
diverticular
complications
The
recommendation
to
avoid
these
foods
to
prevent
diverticular
complications
should
be
reconsidered
