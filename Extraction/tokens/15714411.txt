Short-course

a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
A
major
difficulty
associated
with
the
use
of
standard
therapy
with
isoniazid
for
latent
tuberculosis
infection
is
poor
patient
adherence
to
therapy
because
of
the
prolonged
course
required
Shorter
courses
of
therapy
involving
>
or
=2
drugs
have
been
proposed
as
an
alternative
to
standard
therapy
but
they
have
not
undergone
enough
testing
We
performed
a
meta-analysis
to
determine
the
equivalence
of
daily
short-course
therapy
with
rifampin
plus
isoniazid
for
3
months
and
standard
therapy
with
isoniazid
for
6-12
months
The
end
points
that
were
evaluated
were
development
of
active
tuberculosis
severe
adverse
drug
reactions
and
death
We
searched
published
information
in
the
Cochrane
Library
MEDLINE
and
Embase
databases
as
well
as
unpublished
information
in
the
Cambridge
Scientific
Abstracts
Internet
database
Conference
Papers
Index
AIDS
and
Cancer
Research
Abstracts
and
ClinicalTrialsgov
We
also
scanned
the
reference
lists
of
articles
We
only
included
trials
in
which
individuals
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
treatment
Two
reviewers
independently
applied
the
criteria
for
trial
selection
assessed
trial
quality
and
extracted
data
Five
trials
comprising
1926
adults
from
Hong
Kong
Spain
and
Uganda
were
identified
The
mean
duration
of
follow-up
varied
from
13
to
37
months
Overall
development
of
active
tuberculosis
was
equivalent
in
association
with
both
regimens
(pooled

that
is
the
result
of

Severe
adverse
effects
were
reported
with
a
similar
frequency
for
both
regimens
(pooled

CI
-7%
to
5%)
but
with
statistically
significant
heterogeneity
detected
(I2

However
a
subanalysis
of
high-quality
trials
(including
74%
of
the
sample
size)
suggested
that
both
regimens
were
equally
safe
In
3
trials
(comprising
1390
patients)
that
provided
data
on
mortality
the
regimens
showed
equivalence
(pooled

Short-course
therapy
with
rifampin
plus
isoniazid
was
equivalent
to
standard
therapy
with
isoniazid
in
terms
of
efficacy
the
proportion
of
severe
side
effects
that
occurred
and
mortality
