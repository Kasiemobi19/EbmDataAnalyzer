The
effectiveness
of
interventions
to
increase
physical
activity
A
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
The
Guide
to
Community
Preventive
Service's
methods
for
systematic
reviews
were
used
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
various
approaches
to
increasing
physical
activity
informational
behavioral
and
social
and
environmental
and
policy
approaches
Changes
in
physical
activity
behavior
and
aerobic
capacity
were
used
to
assess
effectiveness
Two
informational
interventions
("point-of-decision"
prompts
to
encourage
stair
use
and
community-wide
campaigns)
were
effective
as
were
three
behavioral
and
social
interventions
(school-based
physical
education
social
support
in
community
settings
and
individually-adapted
health
behavior
change)
and
one
environmental
and
policy
intervention
(creation
of
or
enhanced
access
to
places
for
physical
activity
combined
with
informational
outreach
activities)
Additional
information
about
applicability
other
effects
and
barriers
to
implementation
are
provided
for
these
interventions
Evidence
is
insufficient
to
assess
a
number
of
interventions
classroom-based
health
education
focused
on
information
provision
and
family-based
social
support
(because
of
inconsistent
findings)
mass
media
campaigns
and
college-based
health
education
and
physical
education
(because
of
an
insufficient
number
of
studies)
and
classroom-based
health
education
focused
on
reducing
television
viewing
and
video
game
playing
(because
of
insufficient
evidence
of
an
increase
in
physical
activity)
These
recommendations
should
serve
the
needs
of
researchers
planners
and
other
public
health
decision
makers
