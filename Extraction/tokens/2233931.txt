effect
of
low-dose
warfarin
on

of

in
patients
with
nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation

Abstract
Text
Nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
increases
the
risk
of
stroke
presumably
from
atrial
thromboemboli
There
is
uncertainty
about
the
efficacy
and
risks
of
long-term
warfarin
therapy
to
prevent
stroke
We
conducted
an
unblinded
randomized
controlled
trial
of
long-term
low-dose
warfarin
therapy
(target
prothrombin-time
ratio
12
to
15)
in
patients
with
nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
The
control
group
was
not
given
warfarin
but
could
choose
to
take
aspirin
A
total
of
420
patients
entered
the
trial
(212
in
the
warfarin
group
and
208
in
the
control
group)
and
were
followed
for
an
average
of
22
years
Prothrombin
times
in
the
warfarin
group
were
in
the
target
range
83
percent
of
the
time
Only
10
percent
of
the
patients
assigned
to
receive
warfarin
discontinued
the
drug
permanently
There
were
2
strokes
in
the
warfarin
group
(incidence
041
percent
per
year)
as
compared
with
13
strokes
in
the
control
group
(incidence
298
percent
per
year)
for
a
reduction
of
86
percent
in
the
risk
of
stroke
(warfarincontrol
incidence
ratio
=
014
95
percent
confidence
interval
004
to
049
P
=
00022)
There
were
37
deaths
altogether
The
death
rate
was
markedly
lower
in
the
warfarin
group
than
in
the
control
group
225
percent
as
compared
with
597
percent
per
year
for
an
incidence
ratio
of
038
(95
percent
confidence
interval
017
to
082
P
=
0005)
There
was
one
fatal
hemorrhage
in
each
group
The
frequency
of
bleeding
events
that
led
to
hospitalization
or
transfusion
was
essentially
the
same
in
both
groups
The
warfarin
group
had
a
higher
rate
of
minor
hemorrhage
than
the
control
group
(38
vs
21
patients)
Long-term
low-dose
warfarin
therapy
is
highly
effective
in
preventing
stroke
in
patients
with
non-rheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
and
can
be
quite
safe
with
careful
monitoring
