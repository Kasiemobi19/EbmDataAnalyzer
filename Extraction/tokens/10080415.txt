Title
Meta-analysis
of
exercise
testing
to
detect
coronary
artery
disease
in
women
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
accuracy
of
the
exercise
electrocardiogram
(ECG)
exercise
thallium
and
exercise
echocardiogram
(echo)
for
the
diagnosis
of
coronary
artery
disease
in
women
English
language
studies
published
between
1966
and
1995
were
identified
through
a
MEDLINE
search
Studies
that
contained
data
on
at
least
50
women
who
underwent
both
an
exercise
test
and
coronary
angiography
were
examined
Studies
were
reviewed
for
sensitivity
specificity
and
methodologic
characteristics
by
2
independent
reviewers
Nineteen
studies
met
the
inclusion
criteria
for
exercise
electrocardiography
5
studies
for
exercise
thallium
and
3
studies
for
exercise
echo
The
exercise
ECG
had
a
weighted
mean
sensitivity
specificity
and
a
likelihood
ratio
(LR)
of
061
(95%
confidence
intervals
054
to
068)
070
(064
to
075)
(+)
LR
225
(184
to
266)
(-)
LR
055
(047
to
062)
respectively
The
exercise
thallium
had
a
weighted
mean
sensitivity
specificity
and
LRs
of
078
(072
to
083)
064
(051
to
077)
(+)
LR
287
(10
to
496)
(-)
LR
036
(027
to
045)
The
exercise
echo
had
a
weighted
mean
sensitivity
specificity
and
LRs
of
086
(075
to
096)
079
(072
to
086)
(+)
LR
429
(293
to
565)
(-)
LR
018
(005
to
031)
Thallium
subset
analysis
revealed
that
studies
using
planar
imaging
were
more
specific
than
those
using
tomographic
imaging
Thus
currently
available
exercise
tests
are
only
moderately
sensitive
and
specific
for
the
diagnosis
of
coronary
artery
disease
in
women
