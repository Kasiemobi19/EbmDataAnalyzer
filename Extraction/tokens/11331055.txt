on

The
Heart
and
Estrogen/Progestin
Replacement
Study
(HERS)
Abstract
Text
To
determine
if
estrogen
plus
progestin
reduces
the
incidence
of
fractures
or
height
loss
in
postmenopausal
women
with
coronary
disease
We
enrolled
2763
postmenopausal
women
with
coronary
disease
and
with
an
intact
uterus
into
the
Heart
Estrogen/progestin
Replacement
Study
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
secondary
prevention
trial
of
cardiovascular
disease
Radiographically
documented
clinical
fractures
were
a
prespecified
secondary
endpoint
Height
loss
was
used
as
a
surrogate
for
vertebral
fractures
The
average
age
of
the
women
was
667
+/-
67
years
and
fewer
than
15%
of
the
women
had
osteoporosis
based
on
their
bone
density
Women
were
randomly
assigned
to
either
0625
mg
of
conjugated
equine
estrogens
plus
25
mg
of
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
in
1
tablet
daily
(n
=
1380)
or
placebo
(n
=
1383)
Follow-up
averaged
41
years
82%
of
those
assigned
to
hormone
treatment
were
taking
it
at
the
end
of
1
year
and
64%
at
the
end
of
the
study
During
10554
person
years
of
follow-up
286
women
experienced
a
fracture
138
in
the
treatment
group
(263
per
1000
person
years)
and
148
in
the
placebo
group
(280
per
1000
person
years)
relative

These
included
58
wrist
fractures
(101
06
to
17)
27
hip
fractures
(109
05
to
23)
32
spine
fractures
(069
03
to
14)
and
192
other
fractures
(091
07
to
12)
There
was
no
difference
in
average
height
loss
between
the
treatment
and
placebo
groups
or
in
the
percent
of
women
who
lost
more
than
2
cm
in
height
106%
in
the
treatment
group
and
121%
in
the
placebo
group
There
was
no
evidence
of
a
reduction
in
the
incidence
of
fractures
or
rate
of
height
loss
in
older
women
not
selected
for
osteoporosis
Randomized
studies
are
needed
to
clarify
the
effect
of
hormone
replacement
therapy
on
fracture
risk
among
women
with
and
without
osteoporosis
