Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
effect
of
unmodified
cows'
milk
and
iron
supplemented
formula
milk
on
psychomotor
development
in
infants
from
inner
city
areas
when
used
as
the
main
milk
source
Double
blind
randomised
intervention
trial
Birmingham
health
centre
100
infants
mean
age
78
months
(range
57
to
86
months)
whose
mothers
had
already
elected
to
use
unmodified
cows'
milk
as
their
infant's
milk
source
Changing
to
an
iron
supplemented
formula
milk
from
enrolment
to
18
months
of
age
or
continuing
with
unmodified
cows'
milk
Developmental
assessments
using
Griffiths
scales
at
enrolment
and
at
18
and
24
months
85
participants
completed
the
trial
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
haemoglobin
concentration
between
the
two
groups
at
enrolment
but
by
18
months
of
age
33%
of
the
unmodified
cows'
milk
group
but
only
2%
of
the
iron
supplemented
group
were
anaemic
(P<0001)
The
experimental
groups
had
Griffiths
general
quotient
scores
that
were
not
significantly
different
at
enrolment
but
the
scores
in
both
groups
declined
during
the
study
By
24
months
the
decrease
in
the
mean
scores
in
the
unmodified
cows'
milk
group
was
147
whereas
the
decrease
in
the
mean
scores
in
the
iron
supplemented
group
was
93
(P<002
95%
confidence
interval
04
to
104)
Mean
subquotient
scores
were
considerably
lower
in
the
unmodified
cows'
milk
group
at
24
months
significantly
so
for
personal
and
social
scores
(P<002
12
to
168
[corrected])
Replacing
unmodified
cows'
milk
with
an
iron
supplemented
formula
milk
up
to
18
months
of
age
in
infants
from
inner
city
areas
prevents
iron
deficiency
anaemia
and
reduces
the
decline
in
psychomotor
development
seen
in
such
infants
from
the
second
half
of
the
first
year
