Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
length
of
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
(short
versus
long
duration)
after
a
first
episode
of
venous
thromboembolism
(VTE)
Meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
comparing
two
durations
of
anticoagulation
identified
in
1999
by
a
computerized
search
of
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trial
Register
Medline
and
Embase
completed
by
an
extensive
review
of
the
references
of
pertinent
articles
The
meta-analysis
was
performed
on
literature
data
Seven
published
controlled
trials
were
included
Relative
risks
with
95%
confidence
intervals
were
computed
using
the
relative
risk
logarithm
method
Statistical
significance
was
set
up
at
001
for
the
test
of
association
Outcomes
are
major
haemorrhage
and
recurrence
after
a
12-month
follow-up
For
the
recurrence
end-point
(sample
size
of
2304
patients)
a
duration
treatment
of
12-24
weeks
seems
preferable
to
a
3-6
week
regimen
with
a
relative
risk
(RR)
of
060
(95%
CI
045-079
P
<
0001)
For
the
major
haemorrhage
end-point
(1823
patients)
the
RR
is
not
significantly
different
from
1
(RR
=
143
95%
CI
051-401
P
=
0
5)
The
results
were
similar
for
the
subgroup
'permanent
risk
factors'
or
'idiopathic
VTE'
(RR
for
recurrence
=
048
95%
CI
0
34-068
P
<
0001)
The
tendency
was
similar
although
not
reaching
statistical
significance
for
the
'temporary
risk
factors'
subgroup
(RR
for
recurrence
=
034
95%
CI
013-093
P
=
0035)
After
a
first
episode
of
VTE
a
long-term
treatment
regimen
allows
a
significant
reduction
in
the
incidence
of
recurrences
without
increasing
the
incidence
of
bleeding
events
