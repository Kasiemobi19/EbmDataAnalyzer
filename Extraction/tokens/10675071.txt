Abstract
Text
Diabetes
mellitus
is
a
strong
risk
factor
for
cardiovascular
and
renal
disease
We
investigated
whether
the
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitor
ramipril
can
lower
these
risks
in
patients
with
diabetes
3577
people
with
diabetes
included
in
the
Heart
Outcomes
Prevention
Evaluation
study
aged
55
years
or
older
who
had
a
previous
cardiovascular
event
or
at
least
one
other
cardiovascular
risk
factor
no
clinical
proteinuria
heart
failure
or
low
ejection
fraction
and
who
were
not
taking
ACE
inhibitors
were
randomly
assigned
ramipril
(10
mg/day)
or
placebo
and
vitamin
E
or
placebo
according
to
a
two-by-two
factorial
design
The
combined
primary
outcome
was
myocardial
infarction
stroke
or
cardiovascular
death
Overt
nephropathy
was
a
main
outcome
in
a
substudy
The
study
was
stopped
6
months
early
(after
45
years)
by
the
independent
data
safety
and
monitoring
board
because
of
a
consistent
benefit
of
ramipril
compared
with
placebo
Ramipril
lowered
the
risk
of
the
combined
primary
outcome
by
25%
(95%
CI
12-36
p=00004)
myocardial
infarction
by
22%
(6-36)
stroke
by
33%
(10-50)
cardiovascular
death
by
37%
(21-51)
total
mortality
by
24%
(8-37)
revascularisation
by
17%
(2-30)
and
overt
nephropathy
by
24%
(3-40
p=0027)
After
adjustment
for
the
changes
in
systolic
(24
mm
Hg)
and
diastolic
(10
mm
Hg)
blood
pressures
ramipril
still
lowered
the
risk
of
the
combined
primary
outcome
by
25%
(12-36
p=00004)
Ramipril
was
beneficial
for
cardiovascular
events
and
overt
nephropathy
in
people
with
diabetes
The
cardiovascular
benefit
was
greater
than
that
attributable
to
the
decrease
in
blood
pressure
This
treatment
represents
a
vasculoprotective
and
renoprotective
effect
for
people
with
diabetes
