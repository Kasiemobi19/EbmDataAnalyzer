Reduction
of
environmental
tobacco
smoke
exposure
in
asthmatic
children
A
2-year
follow-up
Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
long-term
maintenance
of
a
previously
reported
behavioral
counseling
intervention
to
reduce
asthmatic
children's
exposure
to
environmental
tobacco
smoke
(ETS)
Families
of
asthmatic
children
(6
to
17
years)
including
at
least
one
parent
who
smoked
in
the
home
recruited
from
four
pediatric
allergy
clinics
Participants
were
randomized
to
one
of
three
groups
behavioral
counseling
to
reduce
ETS
exposure
self-monitoring
control
and
usual
medical
care
control
Counseling
concluded
at
month
6
and
the
original
trial
ended
at
month
12
Two
follow-up
interviews
occurred
at
months
20
and
30
The
originally
reported
analysis
of
baseline
to
12
months
was
reanalyzed
with
a
more
robust
restricted
maximum
likelihood
procedure
The
2-year
follow-up
period
was
analyzed
similarly
Significantly
greater
change
occurred
in
the
counseling
group
than
the
control
groups
and
was
sustained
throughout
the
2
years
of
follow-up
Further
exploratory
analyses
suggested
that
printed
counseling
materials
given
to
all
participants
at
month
12
(conclusion
of
the
original
study)
were
associated
with
decreased
exposure
in
the
control
groups
Such
long-term
maintenance
of
behavior
change
is
highly
unusual
in
the
general
behavioral
science
literature
let
alone
for
addictive
behaviors
We
conclude
that
ETS
exposure
can
be
reduced
and
that
a
clinician-delivered
treatment
may
provide
substantial
benefit
