Does
leucocytosis
identify
bacterial
infections
in
febrile
neonates
presenting
to
the
emergency
department
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
undertaken
to
evaluate
the
discriminatory
power
of
the
peripheral
white
blood
cell
(WBC)
count
to
identify
bacterial
infections
in
a
cohort
of
febrile
neonates
(<or=28
days
of
age)
presenting
to
an
emergency
department
Retrospective
medical
record
review
using
descriptive
statistics
and
a
receiver
operating
characteristic
(ROC)
curve
Neonates
who
presented
to
a
tertiary
care
paediatric
emergency
department
between
1
January
1999
and
22
August
2002
had
a
temperature
>or=38
degrees
C
underwent
lumbar
puncture
and
had
a
WBC
count
obtained
were
included
They
were
divided
according
to
microbiological
and
radiographic
findings
into
four
groups
bacterial
infections
viral
infections
pneumonia
and
negative
sepsis
evaluations
A
total
of
69
febrile
neonates
met
the
inclusion
criteria
The
number
of
neonates
in
each
group
was
as
follows
8
with
bacterial
infections
10
with
viral
infections
3
with
pneumonias
and
48
with
negative
sepsis
evaluations
There
was
substantial
overlap
in
WBC
counts
among
the
groups
The
area
under
the
ROC
curve
was
07231
(95%
CI
05665
to
08797)
In
a
cohort
of
febrile
neonates
evaluated
in
the
emergency
department
the
WBC
count
had
modest
discriminatory
power
in
identifying
neonates
with
bacterial
infections
and
demonstrated
substantial
overlap
among
groups
The
present
data
suggest
against
the
use
of
any
WBC
count
threshold
to
identify
bacterial
infections
in
febrile
neonates
presenting
to
the
emergency
department
