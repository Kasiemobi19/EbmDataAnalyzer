Complications
of
use
of
intrauterine

among
HIV-1-infected
women
Abstract
Text
A
WHO
expert
group
and
the
International
Planned
Parenthood
Federation
recommend
against
use
of
intrauterine
devices
(IUDs)
in
HIV-1-infected
women
based
on
theoretical
concerns
about
pelvic
infection
and
increased
blood
loss
We
investigated
whether
the
risk
of
complications
after
IUD
insertion
is
higher
in
HIV-1-infected
women
than
in
non-infected
women
649
(156
HIV-1
infected
493
non-infected)
women
in
Nairobi
Kenya
who
requested
and
met
local
eligibility
criteria
for
insertion
of
an
IUD
were
enrolled
We
gathered
information
on
IUD-related
complications
including
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
removals
due
to
infection
pain
or
bleeding
expulsions
and
pregnancies
at
1
and
4
months
after
insertion
Patients'
HIV-1
status
was
masked
from
physicians
Complications
were
identified
in
48
of
615
women
(11
[76%]
HIV-1-infected
women
37
[79%]
non-infected)
Incident
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(two
[14%]
HIV-1
infected
one
[02%]
non-infected)
and
infection-related
complications
(any
tenderness
removal
of
IUD
for
infection
or
pain
ten
[69%]
HIV-1
infected
27
[57%]
non-infected)
were
also
rare
and
similar
in
the
two
groups
Complication
rates
were
similar
by
CD4
(immune)
status
Multivariate
analyses
suggested
no
association
between
HIV-1
infection
and
increased
risks
for
overall
complications
(odds
ratio
08
[95%
CI
04-17])
or
infection-related
complications
(10
[05-23])
adjusted
for
marital
status
study
site
previous
IUD
use
ethnic
origin
and
frequency
of
sexual
intercourse
but
a
slight
increase
cannot
be
ruled
out
Our
data
suggest
that
IUDs
may
be
a
safe
contraceptive
method
for
appropriately
selected
HIV-1-infected
women
with
continuing
access
to
medical
services
Both
the
International
Planned
Parenthood
Federation
and
the
World
Health
Organization
have
warned
against
use
of
IUDs
in
HIV-infected
women
due
to
theoretical
concerns
about
pelvic
infection
and
increased
blood
loss
No
published
studies
have
investigated
this
concern
however
The
validity
of
this
recommendation
was
investigated
in
a
comparative
study
of
156
HIV-1-infected
and
493
non-infected
women
from
two
public
family
planning
clinics
(Kenyatta
National
Hospital
and
Riruta
City
Clinic)
in
Nairobi
Kenya
who
requested
and
met
local
eligibility
criteria
for
IUD
insertion
At
1
and
4
months
after
insertion
information
was
collected
from
physicians--blinded
as
to
the
patient's
HIV
status--on
IUD-related
complications
such
as
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(PID)
removals
expulsions
and
pregnancies
Complications
were
identified
in
11
(76%)
HIV-positive
and
37
(79%)
HIV-negative
women
There
were
only
3
incident
cases
of
PID
2
of
which
occurred
in
HIV-infected
women
IUD
removal
due
to
pain
or
infection
occurred
in
10
(69%)
HIV-infected
and
27
(57%)
noninfected
women
There
were
no
differences
in
overall
IUD
complications
in
HIV-1-infected
women
by
CD4
status
(severely
moderately
or
mildly
immunocompromised)
After
adjustment
for
marital
status
study
site
previous
IUD
use
ethnic
origin
and
frequency
of
sexual
intercourse
multivariate
analysis
suggested
no
association
between
HIV-1
infection
and
increased
risks
for
overall
IUD-related
complications
(odds
ratio
(OR)
08
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
04-17)
or
infection-related
complications
(OR
10
95%
CI
05-23)
These
findings
suggest
that
the
IUD
may
be
a
safe
contraceptive
method
for
appropriately
selected
HIV-infected
women
with
continuing
access
to
medical
services
