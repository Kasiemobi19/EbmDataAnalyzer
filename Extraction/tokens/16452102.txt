Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
potential
of
anticholinergic
drugs
as
a
cause
of
non-degenerative
mild
cognitive
impairment
in
elderly
people
Longitudinal
cohort
study
63
randomly
selected
general
practices
in
the
Montpellier
region
of
southern
France
372
people
aged
>
60
years
without
dementia
at
recruitment
Anticholinergic
burden
from
drug
use
cognitive
examination
and
neurological
assessment
92%
of
subjects
continuously
used
anticholinergic
drugs
during
the
year
before
cognitive
assessment
Compared
with
non-users
they
had
poorer
performance
on
reaction
time
attention
delayed
non-verbal
memory
narrative
recall
visuospatial
construction
and
language
tasks
but
not
on
tasks
of
reasoning
immediate
and
delayed
recall
of
wordlists
and
implicit
memory
Eighty
per
cent
of
the
continuous
users
were
classified
as
having
mild
cognitive
impairment
compared
with
35%
of
non-users
and
anticholinergic
drug
use
was
a
strong
predictor
of
mild
cognitive
impairment
(odds
ratio
512
P
=
0001)
No
difference
was
found
between
users
and
non-users
in
risk
of
developing
dementia
at
follow-up
after
eight
years
Elderly
people
taking
anticholinergic
drugs
had
significant
deficits
in
cognitive
functioning
and
were
highly
likely
to
be
classified
as
mildly
cognitively
impaired
although
not
at
increased
risk
for
dementia
Doctors
should
assess
current
use
of
anticholinergic
drugs
in
elderly
people
with
mild
cognitive
impairment
before
considering
administration
of
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
