Effect
of
calcium
and
vitamin

supplementation
on
bone
density
in
men
and

65

of
age
or
older
Abstract
Text
Inadequate
dietary
intake
of
calcium
and
vitamin
D
may
contribute
to
the
high
prevalence
of
osteoporosis
among
older
persons
We
studied
the
effects
of
three
years
of
dietary
supplementation
with
calcium
and
vitamin
D
on
bone
mineral
density
biochemical
measures
of
bone
metabolism
and
the
incidence
of
nonvertebral
fractures
in
176
men
and
213
women
65
years
of
age
or
older
who
were
living
at
home
They
received
either
500
mg
of
calcium
plus
700
IU
of
vitamin
D3
(cholecalciferol)
per
day
or
placebo
Bone
mineral
density
was
measured
by
dual-energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
blood
and
urine
were
analyzed
every
six
months
and
cases
of
nonvertebral
fracture
were
ascertained
by
means
of
interviews
and
verified
with
use
of
hospital
records
The
mean
(+/-SD)
changes
in
bone
mineral
density
in
the
calcium-vitamin
D
and
placebo
groups
were
as
follows
femoral
neck
+050+/-480
and
-070+/-503
percent
respectively
(P=002)
spine+212+/-406
and
+122+/-425
percent
(P=004)
and
total
body
+006+/-183
and
-109+/-171
percent
(P<0001)
The
difference
between
the
calcium-vitamin
D
and
placebo
groups
was
significant
at
all
skeletal
sites
after
one
year
but
it
was
significant
only
for
total-body
bone
mineral
density
in
the
second
and
third
years
Of
37
subjects
who
had
nonvertebral
fractures
26
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
11
were
in
the
calcium-vitamin
D
group
(P=002)
In
men
and
women
65
years
of
age
or
older
who
are
living
in
the
community
dietary
supplementation
with
calcium
and
vitamin
D
moderately
reduced
bone
loss
measured
in
the
femoral
neck
spine
and
total
body
over
the
three-year
study
period
and
reduced
the
incidence
of
nonvertebral
fractures
