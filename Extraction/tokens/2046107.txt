Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
ability
of
antihypertensive
drug
treatment
to
reduce
the
risk
of
nonfatal
and
fatal
(total)
stroke
in
isolated
systolic
hypertension
Multicenter
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
Community-based
ambulatory
population
in
tertiary
care
centers
4736
persons
(106%)
from
447921
screenees
aged
60
years
and
above
were
randomized
(2365
to
active
treatment
2371
to
placebo)
Systolic
blood
pressure
ranged
from
160
to
219
mm
Hg
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
was
less
than
90
mm
Hg
Of
the
participants
3161
were
not
receiving
antihypertensive
medication
at
initial
contact
and
1575
were
The
average
systolic
blood
pressure
was
170
mm

average
diastolic
blood
pressure
77
mm
Hg
The
mean
age
was
72
years
57%
were
women
and
14%
were
black
--Participants
were
stratified
by
clinical
center
and
by
antihypertensive
medication
status
at
initial
contact
For
step
1
of
the
trial
dose
1
was
chlorthalidone
125
mg/d
or
matching
placebo
dose
2
was
25
mg/d
For
step
2
dose
1
was
atenolol

Secondary
Cardiovascular

measures
Average
follow-up
was
45
years
The
5-year
average
systolic
blood
pressure
was
155
mm
Hg
for
the
placebo
group
and
143
mm
Hg
for
the
active
treatment
group
and
the
5-year
average
diastolic
blood
pressure
was
72
and
68
mm
Hg
respectively
The
5-year
incidence
of
total
stroke
was
52
per
100
participants
for
active
treatment
and
82
per
100
for
placebo
The
relative
risk
by
proportional
hazards
regression
analysis
was
064
(P
=
0003)
For
the
secondary
end
point
of
clinical
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
plus
coronary
death
the
relative
risk
was
073
Major
cardiovascular
events
were
reduced
(relative
risk
068)
For
deaths
from
all
causes
the
relative
risk
was
087
In
persons
aged
60
years
and
over
with
isolated
systolic
hypertension
antihypertensive
stepped-care
drug
treatment
with
low-dose
chlorthalidone
as
step
1
medication
reduced
the
incidence
of
total
stroke
by
36%
with
5-year
absolute
benefit
of
30
events
per
1000
participants
Major
cardiovascular
events
were
reduced
with
5-year
absolute
benefit
of
55
events
per
1000
