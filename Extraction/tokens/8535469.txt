Title
A
review
of
the
McMurray
test
definition
interpretation
and
clinical
usefulness
Abstract
Text
Clinicians
frequently
use
the
results
of
clinical
diagnostic
tests
to
make
decisions
concerning
patients
The
intent
of
this
paper
is
to
review
the
technical
aspects
and
measurement
properties
of
the
McMurray
test
and
more
globally
to
illustrate
the
impact
that
indiscriminate
test
application
has
on
test
interpretation
The
literature
shows
that
diagnostic
accuracy
studies
which
evaluate
the
test
described
by
McMurray
yield
remarkably
similar
estimates
of
sensitivity
(about
26%)
and
specificity
(about
94%)
These
test
characteristics
are
applied
to
three
case
scenarios
to
illustrate
the
impact
that
history-specific
prevalence
(ie
the
likelihood
a
patient
has
the
condition
based
on
the
history)
has
on
the
predictive
values
The
results
show
a
high
false
positive
rate
when
applied
to
patients
who
based
on
the
history
have
a
low
pre-physical
examination
likelihood
for
the
condition
of
interest
and
a
higher
false
negative
rate
when
applied
to
patients
who
have
a
high
history-specific
prevalence
Readers
are
warned
that
the
exhaustive
examination
approach
effectively
lowers
the
prevalence
and
results
in
a
high
false
positive
rate
The
impact
that
the
exhaustive
approach
has
on
increasing
the
false
positive
rate
is
universal
to
all
diagnostic
investigations
and
is
not
unique
to
the
McMurray
test
