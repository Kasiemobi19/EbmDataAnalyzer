is
looking

and
has
identified
breastfeeding
as
an
important
factor
CDD
is
studying
the
protective

of
exclusive

the
morbidity

mortality
risks
for
infants
exclusively
partially
or
not
breastfed
CDD
has
identified
trials
of
interventions
for
breastfeeding
promotion
and
the
evaluation
of
approaches
for
the
implementation
of
tested
interventions
among
its
research
priorities

two
management
