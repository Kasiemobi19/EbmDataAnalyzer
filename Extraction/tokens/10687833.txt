Title
Treatment
outcomes
for
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
effectiveness
of
cone
biopsy
cryotherapy
laser
ablation
and
the
loop
electrosurgical
procedure
in
the
treatment
of
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
Systematic
review
of
randomized
controlled
trials
in
subjects
who
underwent
treatment
of
low-
and
high-grade
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
with
these
modalities
Main
outcome
measures
included
the
following
percent
resolution
and
persistence
of
a
lesion
and
notable
complications
for
each
procedure
Pooled
rates
of
resolution
for
low-grade
high-grade
or
combined
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
were
similar
across
the
different
treatment
modalities
(range
852-947%)
with
substantial
overlap
among
the
95%
confidence
intervals
Significant
hemorrhage
occurred
most
frequently
in
subjects
who
received
cone
biopsy
(46%)
(95%
CI
215
699)
followed
by
laser
ablation
(175%)
(95%
CI
070
281)
and
LEEP
(135%)
(95%
CI
024
247)
No
hemorrhages
were
reported
among
subjects
who
received
cryotherapy
Study
sample
sizes
were
relatively
small
There
were
no
reported
cases
of
progression
to
invasive
cancer
but
duration
of
follow-up
(median
follow-up
time
for
all
eligible
studies
=
12
months)
was
not
sufficient
to
evaluate
long-term
outcomes
There
were
no
substantive
differences
in
outcomes
regarding
persistence
and
resolution
in
the
treatment
of
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
for
subjects
receiving
cone
biopsy
cryotherapy
laser
ablation
or
LEEP
