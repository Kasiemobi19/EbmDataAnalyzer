Abstract
Text
A
case
series
of
consecutive
patients
with
cervical
radiculopathy
A
multitude
of
physical
therapy
interventions
have
been
proposed
to
be
effective
in
the
management
of
cervical
radiculopathy
However
outcome
studies
using
consistent
treatment
approaches
on
a
well-defined
sample
of
patients
are
lacking
The
purpose
of
this
case
series
is
to
describe
the
outcomes
of
a
consecutive
series
of
patients
presenting
to
physical
therapy
with
cervical
radiculopathy
and
managed
with
the
use
of
manual
physical
therapy
cervical
traction
and
strengthening
exercises
Eleven
consecutive
patients
(mean
age
517
years
SD
82)
who
presented
with
cervical
radiculopathy
on
the
initial
examination
were
treated
with
a
standardized
approach
including
manual
physical
therapy
cervical
traction
and
strengthening
exercises
of
the
deep
neck
flexors
and
scapulothoracic
muscles
At
the
initial
evaluation
all
patients
completed
self-report
measures
of
pain
and
function
including
a
numeric
pain
rating
scale
(NPRS)
the
Neck
Disability
Index
(NDI)
and
the
Patient-Specific
Functional
Scale
(PSFS)
All
patients
again
completed
the
outcome
measures
in
addition
to
the
global
rating
of
change
(GROC)
at
the
time
of
discharge
from
therapy
and
at
a
6-month
follow-up
session

Ten
of
the
11
patients
(91%)
demonstrated
a
clinically
meaningful
improvement
in
pain
and
function
following
a
mean
of
71
(SD
15)
physical
therapy
visits
and
at
the
6-month
follow-up
Ninety-one
percent
(10
of
11)
of
patients
with
cervical
radiculopathy
in
this
case
series
improved
as
defined
by
the
patients
classifying
their
level
of
improvement
as
at
least
"quite
a
bit
better"
on
the
GROC
However
because
a
cause-and-effect
relationship
cannot
be
inferred
from
a
case
series
follow-up
randomized
clinical
trials
should
be
performed
to
further
investigate
the
effectiveness
of
manual
physical
therapy
cervical
traction
and
strengthening
exercises
in
a
homogeneous
group
of
patients
with
cervical
radiculopathy
