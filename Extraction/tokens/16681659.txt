Comparison
of
the
surgical
outcomes
of
punch
incision
and
elliptical
excision
in
treating
epidermal
inclusion
cysts
a
prospective
randomized
study
Abstract
Text
Punch
incision
has
been
introduced
as
an
alternative
method
to
surgical
excision
for
troublesome
epidermal
inclusion
cysts
To
date
there
is
no
randomized
study
directly
comparing
the
long-term
results
of
these
two
methods
To
compare
the
surgical
outcomes
of
these
two
procedures
and
to
identify
the
characteristics
of
a
lesion
most
suitable
for
the
punch
incision
technique
In
a
16-month
period
60
patients
with
noninfected
epidermal
inclusion
cysts
were
randomly
treated
with
either
punch
incision
or
elliptical
excision
Demographic
data
size
and
location
of
lesion
length
of
wound
operative
time
complications
recurrence
and
patient
satisfaction
were
compared
statistically
The
mean
lengths
of
the
wounds
in
the
punch
incision
and
elliptical
excision
groups
were
073
and
234
cm
respectively
(p<001)
Mean
operative
time
was
significantly
shorter
in
the
punch
group
(127
minutes)
as
compared
with
the
surgical
group
(216
minutes)
(p<001)
No
complication
occurred
in
the
punch
incision
group
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
recurrence
rate
Punch
incision
produces
a
superior
cosmetic
result
while
keeping
a
low
recurrence
rate
of
cysts
Epidermal
inclusion
cysts
measuring
1
to
2
cm
that
are
located
on
the
face
or
in
an
area
of
cosmetic
concern
are
best
treated
with
punch
incision
