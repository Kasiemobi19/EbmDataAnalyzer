Abstract
Text
One
hundred
two
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
facial
acne
vulgaris
completed
a
12-week
investigator-masked
randomized
parallel-group
comparison
of
a
gel
formation
of
erythromycin
(2%)
with
clindamycin
phosphate
1%
solution
Patients
were
evaluated
at
a
baseline
visit
and
after
4
8
and
12
weeks
of
twice-daily
treatment
Both
medications
significantly
reduced
the
numbers
of
papules
and
open
and
closed
comedones
No
significant
differences
in
lesion
count
reductions
were
detected
between
the
treatment
groups
after
8
and
12
weeks
of
treatment
By
the
end
of
12
weeks
48%
of
the
patients
in
the
erythromycin
group
and
47%
in
the
clindamycin
group
had
good
or
excellent
responses
to
treatment
No
patient
was
terminated
from
the
study
for
side
effects
Most
patients
65%
in
the
erythromycin
2%
gel
group
and
67%
in
the
clindamycin
phosphate
1%
solution
group
had
a
favorable
impression
of
the
overall
cosmetic
characteristics
of
their
study
medication
