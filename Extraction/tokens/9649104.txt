Comparison
of
bimanual
examination
with
ultrasound
examination
before
hysterectomy
for
uterine
leiomyoma
Abstract
Text
To
correlate
the
preoperative
bimanual
examination
with
ultrasound
examination
with
regard
to
estimating
the
size
of
enlarged
nongravid
leiomyomatous
uteri
We
performed
a
retrospective
review
of
161
patients
who
underwent
hysterectomy
for
uterine
leiomyoma
between
January
1994
and
December
1994
and
between
July
1995
and
April
1996
Uterine
size
was
estimated
clinically
by
bimanual
examination
Ultrasound
reports
were
reviewed
Uterine
weights
and
dimensions
in
pathology
reports
were
compared
with
findings
on
bimanual
examination
and
ultrasonography
Body
mass
index
(BMI)
was
calculated
and
patients
were
divided
into
two
groups
one
with
BMIs
of
more
than
30
and
another
with
BMIs
of
less
than
or
equal
to
30
Ultrasound
examination
was
ordered
in
111
patients
(689%)
preoperatively
There
was
a
strong
correlation
between
the
bimanual
examination
findings
and
the
ultrasound
dimensions
The
equation
for
this
relationship
is
ultrasound
length
(cm)=368
+
068
x
number
of
weeks
(r=78
P
<
001)
Ultrasound
length
also
was
related
strongly
to
size
given
in
the
pathologic
reports
the
equation
for
this
relationship
is
ultrasound
length
(cm)=294
+
075
x
pathology
length
(cm)
(r=73
P
<
001)
The
correlation
between
bimanual
examination
and
ultrasound
findings
was
similar
in
obese
and
in
nonobese
patients
when
uterine
size
could
be
estimated
There
is
a
strong
correlation
between
bimanual
and
ultrasound
examinations
with
regard
to
determining
the
size
of
leiomyomatous
uteri
Routine
ultrasound
is
not
indicated
when
an
experienced
examiner
can
assess
uterine
size
Ultrasonography
may
be
appropriate
when
physical
assessment
is
difficult
as
in
the
case
of
obesity
