Title
Is
mucaine
an
appropriate
medication
for
the
relief
of
heartburn
during
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
A
double
blind
comparative
study
comparing
Mucaine
Mucaine
without
oxethazaine
and
placebo
was
carried
out
with
50
patients
with
symptoms
of
heartburn
during
late
pregnancy
We
found
that
the
2
active
treatments
were
more
effective
than
placebo
for
the
relief
of
heartburn
but
there
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
groups
for
the
relief
of
nausea
and
regurgitation
There
was
a
significant
difference
in
the
percentage
of
days
of
use
of
each
medication
with
the
placebo
being
used
least
frequently
Although
not
statistically
significant
for
the
3
measures
for
which
placebo
differed
from
the
active
treatments
patients
showed
a
better
response
to
mucaine
This
suggests
that
the
addition
of
oxethazaine
may
be
of
benefit
The
lack
of
statistical
significance
may
be
due
to
the
relatively
small
number
of
cases
and
the
findings
are
promising
No
side
effects
were
recorded
for
any
treatment
