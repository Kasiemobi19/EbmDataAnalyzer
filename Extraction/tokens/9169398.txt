Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
relation
between
routine
infant
care
practices
and
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
in
Scotland
National
study
of
201
infants
dying
of
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(cases)
and
276
controls
by
means
of
home
interviews
comparing
methods
of
infant
care
and
socioeconomic
factors
Sleeping
prone
(odds
ratio
696
(95%
confidence
interval
151
to
3197)
and
drug
treatment
in
the
previous
week
(odds
ratio
233
(110
to
494))
were
more
common
in
the
cases
than
controls
on
multivariate
analysis
Smoking
was
confirmed
as
a
significant
risk
factor
(odds
ratio
for
mother
and
father
both
smoking
519
(226
to
1191))
The
risk
increased
with
the
number
of
parents
smoking
(P
<
00001)
with
the
number
of
cigarettes
smoked
by
mother
or
father
(P
=
00001)
and
with
bed
sharing
(P
<
0005)
A
new
finding
was
an
increased
risk
of
dying
of
the
syndrome
for
infants
who
slept
at
night
on
a
mattress
previously
used
by
another
infant
or
adult
(odds
ratio
251
(139
to
452))
However
this
increased
risk
was
not
established
for
mattresses
totally
covered
by
polyvinyl
chloride
Sleeping
prone
and
parental
smoking
are
confirmed
as
modifiable
risk
factors
for
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
Sleeping
on
an
old
mattress
may
be
important
but
needs
confirmation
before
recommendations
can
be
made
