Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
our
study
was
to
use
an
artificial
neural
network
to
differentiate
benign
from
malignant
pulmonary
nodules
on
high-resolution
CT
findings
and
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
artificial
neural
network
output
on
the
performance
of
radiologists
using
receiver
operating
characteristic
analysis
We
selected
155
cases
with
pulmonary
nodules
less
than
3
cm
(99
malignant
nodules
and
56
benign
nodules)
An
artificial
neural
network
was
used
to
distinguish
benign
from
malignant
nodules
on
the
basis
of
seven
clinical
parameters
and
16
radiologic
findings
that
were
extracted
by
attending
radiologists
using
subjective
rating
scales
In
the
observer
test
12
radiologists
(four
attending
radiologists
four
radiology
fellows
and
four
radiology
residents)
were
presented
with
high-resolution
CT
images
first
without
and
then
with
the
artificial
neural
network
output
Observer
performance
was
evaluated
by
means
of
receiver
operating
characteristic
analysis
using
a
continuous
rating
scale
The
artificial
neural
network
showed
a
high
performance
in
differentiating
benign
from
malignant
pulmonary
nodules
(A(z)
=
0951)
The
average
A(z)
value
for
all
radiologists
increased
by
a
statistically
significant
level
from
0831
to
0959
with
the
use
of
the
artificial
neural
network
output
Our
computerized
scheme
using
the
artificial
neural
network
can
improve
the
diagnostic
accuracy
of
radiologists
who
are
differentiating
benign
from
malignant
pulmonary
nodules
on
high-resolution
CT
