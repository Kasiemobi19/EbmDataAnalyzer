Prevention
of
ultraviolet-light-induced
herpes
labialis
by
sunscreen
Abstract
Text
Sunlight
exposure
is
reported
by
some
patients
to
precede
onset
of
recurrent
herpes
labialis
Ultraviolet
(UV)
B
light
is
known
to
be
a
stimulus
for
the
reactivation
of
herpes
simplex
virus
(HSV)
infections
We
assessed
the
effect
of
a
sunblocking
agent
on
UV-light-induced
reactivation
of
recurrent
herpes
labialis
in
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
crossover
trial
38
patients
were
exposed
on
two
separate
occasions
to
four
minimum
erythema
doses
of
UV
light
at
an
area
of
previous
labial
herpes
recurrence
A
solution
containing
sunscreen
was
applied
to
the
lips
before
one
exposure
and
a
matched
placebo
before
the
other
After
placebo
and
UV
exposure
herpes
labialis
developed
in
27
(71%)
of
the
38
patients
with
a
mean
time
to
recurrence
of
29
(SEM
02)
days
In
contrast
when
sunscreen
was
applied
before
UV
exposure
no
lesions
developed
but
1
of
the
35
patients
shed
virus
at
the
exposure
site
We
conclude
that
UV
light
is
a
potent
stimulus
for
inducing
reactivation
of
herpes
labialis
and
that
application
of
sunscreen
may
be
effective
in
the
prevention
of
sunlight-induced
recurrent
infection
