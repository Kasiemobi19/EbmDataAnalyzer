Abstract
Text
Only
limited
data
on
the
rate
of
hemodynamic
progression
and
predictors
of
outcome
in
asymptomatic
patients
with
valvular
aortic
stenosis
(AS)
are
available
In
123
adults
(mean
age
63
+/-
16
years)
with
asymptomatic
AS
annual
clinical
echocardiographic
and
exercise
data
were
obtained
prospectively
(mean
follow-up
of
25
+/-
14
years)
Aortic
jet
velocity
increased
by
032
+/-
034
m/s
per
year
and
mean
gradient
by
7
+/-
7
mm
Hg
per
year
valve
area
decreased
by
012
+/-
019
cm2
per
year
Kaplan-Meier
event-free
survival
with
end
points
defined
as
death
(n
=
8)
or
aortic
valve
surgery
(n
=
48)
was
93
+/-
5%
at
1
year
62
+/-
8%
at
3
years
and
26
+/-
10%
at
5
years
Univariate
predictors
of
outcome
included
baseline
jet
velocity
mean
gradient
valve
area
and
the
rate
of
increase
in
jet
velocity
(all
P
<
or
=
001)
but
not
age
sex
or
cause
of
AS
Those
with
an
end
point
had
a
smaller
exercise
increase
in
valve
area
blood
pressure
and
cardiac
output
and
a
greater
exercise
decrease
in
stroke
volume
Multivariate
predictors
of
outcome
were
jet
velocity
at
baseline
(P
<
0001)
the
rate
of
change
in
jet
velocity
(P
<
0001)
and
functional
status
score
(P
=
002)
The
likelihood
of
remaining
alive
without
valve
replacement
at
2
years
was
only
21
+/-
18%
for
a
jet
velocity
at
entry
>
40
m/s
compared
with
66
+/-
13%
for
a
velocity
of
30
to
40
m/s
and
84
+/-
16%
for
a
jet
velocity
<
30
m/s
(P
<
0001)
In
adults
with
asymptomatic
AS
the
rate
of
hemodynamic
progression
and
clinical
outcome
are
predicted
by
jet
velocity
the
rate
of
change
in
jet
velocity
and
functional
status
