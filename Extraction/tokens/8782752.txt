Abstract
Text
Adjusted-dose
warfarin
is
highly
efficacious
for
prevention
of
ischaemic
stroke
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
(AF)
However
this
treatment
carries
a
risk
of
bleeding
and
the
need
for
frequent
medical
monitoring
We
sought
an
alternative
that
would
be
safer
and
easier
to
administer
to
patients
with
AF
who
are
at
high-risk
of
thromboembolism
1044
patients
with
AF
and
with
at
least
one
thromboembolic
risk
factor
(congestive
heart
failure
or

systolic

of

Hg
at
study
enrollment
or
being
a
woman
aged
over
75
years)
were
randomly
assigned
either
a
combination
of
low-intensity
fixed-dose
warfarin
(international
normalised
ratio
[INR]
12-15
for
initial
dose
adjustment)
and
aspirin
(325
mg/day)
or
adjusted-dose
warfarin
(INR
20-30)
Drugs
were
given
open-labelled
The
mean
INR
during
follow-up
of
patients
taking
combination
therapy
(n
=
521)
was
13
compared
with
24
for
those
taking
adjusted-dose
warfarin
(n
=
523)
During
follow-up
54%
of
INRs
in
patients
taking
combination
therapy
were
12-15
and
34%
were
less
than
12
The
trial
was
stopped
after
a
mean
follow-up
of
11
years
when
the
rate
of
ischaemic
stroke
and
systemic
embolism
(primary
events)
in
patients
given
combination
therapy
(79%
per
year)
was
significantly
higher
than
in
those
given
adjusted-dose
warfarin
(19%
per
year)
at
an
interim
analysis
(p
<
00001)
an
absolute
reduction
of
60%
per
year
(95%
Cl
34

by
adjusted-dose
warfarin
The
annual
rates
of
disabling
stroke
(56%
vs
17%
p
=
00007)
and
of
primary
event
or
vascular
death
(118%
vs
64%
p
=
0002)
were
also
higher
with
combination
therapy
The
rates
of
major
bleeding
were
similar
in
both
treatment
groups
Low-intensity
fixed-dose
warfarin
plus
aspirin
in
this
regimen
is
insufficient
for
stroke
prevention
in
patients
with
non-valvular
AF
at
high-risk
for
thromboembolism
adjusted-dose
warfarin
(target
INR
20-30)
importantly
reduces
stroke
for
high-risk
patients
