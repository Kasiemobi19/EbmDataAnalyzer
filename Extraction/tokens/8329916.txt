Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
relations
between
early
introduction
of
solid
food
and
infant
weight
gastrointestinal
illness
and
allergic
illnesses
during
the
first
two
years
of
life
Prospective
observational
study
of
infants
followed
up
for
24
months
after
birth
Community
setting
in
Dundee
671
newborn
infants
of
whom
455
were
still
available
for
study
at
2
years
of
age
Infants'
diet
weight
and
incidence
of
gastrointestinal
illness
respiratory
illness
napkin
dermatitis
and
eczema
at
2
weeks
and
2
3
4

15
18
21
and
24
months
of
age
The
infants
given
solid
food
at
an
early
age
(at
<
8
weeks
or
8-12
weeks)
were
heavier
than
those
introduced
to
solids
later
(after
12
weeks)
at
4
8
13
and
26
weeks
of
age
(p
<
001)
but
not
at
52
and
104
weeks
At
their
first
solid
feed
those
given
solids
early
were
heavier
than
infants
of
similar
age
who
had
not
yet
received
solids
The
incidence
of
gastrointestinal
illness
wheeze
and
nappy
dermatitis
was
not
related
to
early
introduction
of
solids
There
was
a
significant
but
less
than
twofold
increase
in
respiratory
illness
at
14-26
weeks
of
age
and
persistent
cough
at
14-26
and
27-39
weeks
of
age
among
the
infants
given
solids
early
The
incidence
of
eczema
was
increased
in
the
infants
who
received
solids
at
8-12
weeks
of
age
Early
introduction
of
solid
food
to
infants
is
less
harmful
than
was
previously
reported
Longer
follow
up
is
needed
but
meanwhile
a
more
relaxed
approach
to
early
feeding
with
solids
should
be
considered
