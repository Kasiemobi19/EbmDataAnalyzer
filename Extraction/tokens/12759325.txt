Health

Abstract
Text
Establishing
relative
benefit
or
harm
from
specific
antihypertensive
agents
is
limited
by
the
complex
array
of
studies
that
compare
treatments
Network
meta-analysis
combines
direct
and
indirect
evidence
to
better
define
risk
or
benefit
To
summarize
the
available
clinical
trial
evidence
concerning
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
various
antihypertensive
therapies
used
as
first-line
agents
and
evaluated
in
terms
of
major
cardiovascular
disease
end
points
and
all-cause
mortality
We
used
previous
meta-analyses
MEDLINE
searches
and
journal
reviews
from
January
1995
through
December
2002
We
identified
long-term
randomized
controlled
trials
that
assessed
major
cardiovascular
disease
end
points
as
an
outcome
Eligible
studies
included
both
those
with
placebo-treated
or
untreated
controls
and
those
with
actively
treated
controls
Network
meta-analysis
was
used
to
combine
direct
within-trial
between-drug
comparisons
with
indirect
evidence
from
the
other
trials
The
indirect
comparisons
which
preserve
the
within-trial
randomized
findings
were
constructed
from
trials
that
had
one
treatment
in
common
Data
were
combined
from
42
clinical
trials
that
included
192
478
patients
randomized
to
7
major
treatment
strategies
including
placebo
For
all
outcomes
low-dose
diuretics
were
superior
to

None
of
the
first-line
treatment
strategies-beta-blockers
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
calcium
channel
blockers
(CCBs)
alpha-blockers
and
angiotensin
receptor
blockers-was
significantly
better
than
low-dose
diuretics
for
any
outcome
Compared
with
CCBs
low-dose
diuretics
were
associated
with
reduced
risks
of
cardiovascular
disease
events
(RR

and

(RR

Compared

(RR

and

(RR

Compared
with
beta-blockers
low-dose
diuretics
were
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
events
(RR
089
95%
CI
080-098)
Compared
with
alpha-blockers
low-dose
diuretics
were
associated
with
reduced
risks
of
CHF
(RR
051
95%
CI
043-060)
and
cardiovascular
disease
events
(RR

95%
CI
075-093)
Blood
pressure
changes
were
similar
between
comparison
treatments
Low-dose
diuretics
are
the
most
effective
first-line
treatment
for
preventing
the
occurrence
of
cardiovascular
disease
morbidity
and
mortality
Clinical
practice
and
treatment
guidelines
should
reflect
this
evidence
and
future
trials
should
use
low-dose
diuretics
as
the
standard
for
clinically
useful
comparisons
