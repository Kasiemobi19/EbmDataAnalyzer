Title
Predictors
of
intracranial
pathologic
findings
in
patients
who
seek
emergency
care
because
of
headache
Abstract
Text
Clinical
criteria
to
select
patients
with
headache
in
whom
structural
diagnostic
studies
(computed
tomography)
have
a
high
yield
disclosing
intracranial
pathologic
findings
independent
of
abnormal
findings
on
neurologic
examination
have
not
been
defined
To
determine
which
clinical
characteristics
predict
the
presence
of
intracranial
pathologic
findings
independently
of
neurologic
examination
in
patients
with
headache
Case-control
consecutive
sample
Major
metropolitan
trauma
center
emergency
department
Hospital
records
of
139
hospitalized
and
329
randomly
selected
patients
from
1720
nonhospitalized
adult
patients
consecutively
evaluated
for
headache
in
the
emergency
department
were
reviewed
Demographic
data
clinical
characteristics
of
the
headache
results
of
neurologic
and
physical
examinations
and
diagnostic
radiologic
and
laboratory
results
were
correlated
with
final
diagnosis
and
outcome
at
6
months
after
emergency
department
visit
Nonparametric
statistical
analysis
Intracranial
pathologic
findings
were
found
in
18
(38%)
of
468
patients
Acute
onset
and
occipitonuchal
location
of
headache
presence
of
associated
symptoms
and
patient
age
of
55
years
or
older
were
significantly
associated
with
the
finding
of
intracranial
pathology
independently
of
the
findings
from
neurologic
examination
Abnormal
findings
on
neurologic
examination
alone
whether
focal
or
nonfocal
had
a
highly
significant
association
and
a
positive
predictive
value
for
intracranial
pathology
of
39%
Abnormal
results
from
neurologic
examination
are
the
best
clinical
parameters
to
predict
structural
intracranial
pathology
however
in
patients
55
years
or
older
with
headache
of
acute
onset
located
in
the
occipitonuchal
region
that
has
associated
symptoms
computed
tomographic
scan
of
the
head
is
justified
as
part
of
their
clinical
evaluation
independently
of
the
findings
of
the
neurologic
examination
