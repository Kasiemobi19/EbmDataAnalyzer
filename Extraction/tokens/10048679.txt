Etiology
and
treatment
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
in
ambulatory
children
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
etiology
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
in
ambulatory
children
and
to
compare
responses
to
treatment
with
azithromycin
amoxicillin-clavulanate
or
erythromycin
estolate
Ambulatory
patients
with
pneumonia
were
identified
at
the
Children's
Medical
Center
of
Dallas
TX
Children
age
6
months
to
16
years
with
radiographic
and
clinical
evidence
of
pneumonia
were
enrolled
and
randomized
to
receive
either
azithromycin
suspension
for
5
days
or
a
10-day
course
of
amoxicillin-clavulanate
for
those
<5
years
or
erythromycin
estolate
suspension
for
those
>
or
=
5
years
Blood
culture
was
obtained
in
all
patients
and
we
obtained
nasopharyngeal
and
pharyngeal
swabs
for
culture
and
polymerase
chain
reaction
(PCR)
testing
for
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
and
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
and
nasopharyngeal
swabs
for
viral
direct
fluorescent
antibody
and
culture
Acute
and
convalescent
serum
specimens
were
tested
for
antibodies
to
C
pneumoniae
M
pneumoniae
and
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
Patients
were
evaluated
10
to
37
days
later
when
repeat
specimens
for
serology
PCR
and
culture
were
obtained
For
comparative
purposes
healthy
children
attending
the
well-child
clinic
had
nasopharyngeal
and
pharyngeal
swabs
obtained
for
PCR
and
culture
for
C
pneumoniae
and
M
pneumoniae
Between
February
1996
and
December
1997
we
enrolled
174
patients
168
of
whom
fulfilled
protocol
criteria
for
evaluation
There
were
55%
males
and
63%
were
<5
years
of
age
All
blood
cultures
were
sterile
and
there
was
no
correlation
between
the
white
blood
cell
and
differential
counts
and
etiology
of
pneumonia
Etiologic
agents
were
identified
in
73
(43%)
of
168
patients
Infection
was
attributed
to
M
pneumoniae
in
7%
(12
of
168)
C
pneumoniae
in
6%
(10
of
168)
S
pneumoniae
in
27%
(35
of
129)
and
viruses
in
20%
(31
of
157)
None
of
the
swab
specimens
from
75
healthy
control
children
was
positive
for
C
pneumoniae
or
M
pneumoniae
Clinical
response
to
therapy
was
similar
for
the
three
antibiotic
regimens
evaluated
including
those
with
infection
attributed
to
bacterial
agents
Although
a
possible
microbial
etiology
was
identified
in
43%
of
the
evaluable
patients
clinical
findings
and
results
of
blood
cultures
chest
radiographs
and
white
blood
cell
and
differential
counts
did
not
distinguish
patients
with
a
defined
etiology
from
those
without
a
known
cause
for
pneumonia
There
were
no
differences
in
the
clinical
responses
of
patients
to
the
antimicrobial
regimens
studied
