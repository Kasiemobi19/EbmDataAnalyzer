Intrauterine
contraceptive
devices
and
risk
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
standard
of
care
in
high
STI
prevalence
settings
Abstract
Text
The
intrauterine
contraceptive
device
(IUD)
is
highly
effective
and
cost-effective
IUD
use
is
limited
in
some
regions
however
due
to
concerns
about
increased
risk
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(PID)
and
subsequent
complications
such
as
infertility
and
ectopic
pregnancy
Recent
reviews
suggest
that
the
overall
risk
of
PID
with
modern
IUDs
is
lower
than
previously
thought
at
least
in
regions
with
a
low
prevalence
of
sexually
transmitted
infections
(STIs)
Risk
of
PID
may
be
higher
however
in
places
where
gonorrhoea
and
chlamydia
are
prevalent
where
screening
for
STIs
is
limited
and
where
aseptic
conditions
for
insertion
are
difficult
to
ensure
A
World
Health
Organization
multi-centre
study
and
other
studies
have
confirmed
regional
differences
in
STI
prevalence
and
the
WHO
study
established
that
PID
risk
is
temporally
related
to
IUD
insertion
procedures
Studies
of
the
effectiveness
of
antibiotic
prophylaxis
to
prevent
infectious
complications
are
inconclusive
due
at
least
in
part
to
use
of
sub-therapeutic
regimens
for
pathogens
commonly
implicated
in
PID
In
summary
the
IUD
can
be
safe
and
effective
if
inserted
under
aseptic
conditions
in
women
free
of
cervical
infection
Further
study
is
needed
to
define
appropriate
standards
of
care
for
IUD
insertion
where
STI
prevalence
is
high
and
ability
to
rule
out
infection
is
limited
Even
with
safe
insertion
IUD
promotion
in
areas
of
high
STI/HIV
prevalence
must
address
women's
needs
for
dual
protection
from
infection
and
unwanted
pregnancy
