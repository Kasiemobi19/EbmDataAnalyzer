First
trimester
topical
tretinoin
and
congenital
disorders
Abstract
Text
We
used
information
from
the
Group
Health
Cooperative
of
Puget
Sound
Washington
USA
to
evaluate
the
risk
of
birth
defects
in
mothers
exposed
to
topical
tretinoin--a
retinoid
preparation
used
to
treat
acne--in
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy
We
identified
215
women
who
delivered
live
or
stillborn
infants
at
Group
Health
Cooperative
hospitals
and
who
were
exposed
to
topical
tretinoin
early
in
pregnancy
and
430
age-matched
nonexposed
women
who
delivered
live
or
stillborn
infants
at
the
same
hospitals
The
prevalence
of
major
anomalies
among
babies
born
to
the
exposed
women
was
19%
and
among
babies
born
to
the
nonexposed
women
was
26%
The
relative
risk
estimate
for
having
a
baby
with
a
major
congenital
anomaly
for
exposed
versus
nonexposed
women
was
07
(95%
CI
02-23)
We
conclude
that
topical
tretinoin
is
not
associated
with
an
increased
risk
for
major
congenital
disorders
