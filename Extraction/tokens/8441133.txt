Title
Laparoscopic
versus
clinical
diagnosis
of
acute
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
accuracy
of
clinical
diagnosis
of
acute
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(PID)
Data
were
obtained
on
176
consecutive
women
admitted
to
St
Elizabeth
Hospital
Medical
Center
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
PID
All
underwent
diagnostic
laparoscopy
PID
was
established
laparoscopically
in
134
(761%)
of
the
patients
Statistical
tests
for
significant
associations
between
PID
and
each
of
21
clinical
indicators
of
the
disease
were
conducted
using
the
chi
2
and
Mann-Whitney
tests
Stepwise
logistic
regression
was
performed
on
those
variables
whose
univariate
tests
of
significant
association
with
PID
resulted
in
P
values
<
020
An
optimal
set
of
PID
indicators
consisted
of
adnexal
tenderness
lower
abdominal
pain
of
<
one
week's
duration
and
an
elevated
white
blood
cell
count
Use
of
these
indicators
resulted
in
a
test
with
an
estimated
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
866%
and
457%
respectively
Estimated
predictive
values
for
positive
and
negative
test
results
were
084
and
052
respectively
These
results
confirm
the
fact
that
laparoscopy
is
the
definitive
diagnostic
modality
in
PID
