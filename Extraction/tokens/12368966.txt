Title
The
development
of
a
group
B
streptococcus
prevention
policy
at
a
community
hospital
Abstract
Text
In
1996
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
(CDC)
issued
guidelines
for
antepartum
antibiotic
prophylaxis
of
group
B
streptococcal
(GBS)-positive
women
The
objective
of
this
study
is
to
document
results
of
a
GBS
prophylaxis
policy
at
one
nonacademically
affiliated
community
hospital
and
discern
its
effectiveness
with
regard
to
compliance
as
well
as
in
decreasing
the
incidence
of
early
onset
GBS
(EOGBS)
disease
The
development
of
a
GBS-prevention
policy
at
the
Women's
Hospital
of
Greensboro
(WHG)
was
documented
by
means
of
interviews
and
examination
of
minutes
of
meetings
Effectiveness
of
the
policy
was
assessed
by
calculating
the
percentage
of
all
GBS+
or
unknown
mothers
who
received
antepartum
antibiotics
during
a
1-year
period
Additionally
all
newborns
with
any
positive
GBS
culture
during
the
past
13
years
at
WHG
were
identified
The
policy
was
formulated
and
distributed
during
a
6-month
period
by
strong
leadership
community
"buy-in"
and
an
educational
seminar
A
preprinted
physician
order
was
written
so
that
all
GBS-positive/unknown
mothers
would
receive
antepartum
antibiotics
Additionally
a
clinical
pathway
was
used
to
track
and
monitor
maternal
GBS
status
During
October
1
1999
to
September
30
2000
1124
(231%)
mothers
were
found
to
be
GBS
positive/unknown
Of
those
who
delivered
an
infant
>37
weeks'
gestation
and
who
could
be
linked
to
the
pharmacy
database
777
(911%)
received
antepartum
antibiotics
The
incidence
of
EOGBS
disease
at
WHG
before
1996
was
193
+/-
07/1000
births
compared
to
04
+/-
005/1000
after
the
issuance
of
the
guidelines
(p
=
0002
t-test)
Over
90%
of
GBS-positive
mothers
were
treated
with
antibiotics
at
WHG
Associated
with
this
high
adherence
rate
to
the
CDC
guidelines
has
been
a
five-fold
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
EOGBS
disease
We
attribute
these
results
to
the
implementation
of
a
preprinted
physician
order
sheet
to
direct
intrapartum
antibiotics
for
women
with
GBS
positive
or
unknown
colonization
and
the
use
of
a
clinical
pathway
to
track
GBS
colonization
status
