Treatment

Abstract
Text
A
prospective
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
was
conducted
to
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
nitazoxanide
in
the
treatment
of
diarrhea
caused
by
Giardia
intestinalis
or
Entamoeba
histolytica
and/or
E
dispar
in
89
adults
and
adolescents
22
of
whom
were
diagnosed
with
G
intestinalis
53
with
E
histolytica
and/or
E
dispar
and
14
with
both
G
intestinalis
and
E
histolytica
and/or
E
dispar
The
study
medication
was
administered
as
1
nitazoxanide
500-mg
tablet
or
a
matching
placebo
twice
daily
for
3
days
Thirty-eight
(81%)
of
47
patients
in
the
nitazoxanide
treatment
group
resolved
diarrhea
within
7
days
(median
3
days)
after
initiation
of
treatment
versus
17
(40%)
of
42
in
the
placebo
group
(P=0002)
With
its
efficacy
in
treating
a
broad
spectrum
of
enteric
protozoan
pathogens
nitazoxanide
could
play
an
important
role
in
the
management
of
diarrhea
caused
by
enteric
protozoa
reducing
morbidity
and
costs
associated
with
these
diarrheal
illnesses
