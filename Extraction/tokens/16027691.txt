in

a
case-control
study
Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
hypothesis
that
bedsharing
with
an
infant
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(SIDS)
A
12
casecontrol
study
in
Scotland
UK
population
51
million
including
123
infants
who
died
of
SIDS
between
January
1
1996
and
May
31
2000
and
263
controls
The
main
outcome
measure
was
sharing
a
sleep
surface
during
last
sleep
Sharing
a
sleep
surface
was
associated
with
SIDS
(multivariate
OR
289
95%
CI
140
597)
The
largest
risk
was
associated
with
couch
sharing
(OR
669
95%
CI
28
1597)
Of
46
SIDS
infants
who
bedshared
during
their
last
sleep
40
(87%)
were
found
in
the
parents'
bed
Sharing
a
bed
when
<11
weeks
(OR
1020
95%
CI
299
348)
was
associated
with
a
greater
risk
P
=
010
compared
with
sharing
when
older
(OR
107
95%
CI
032
356)
The
association
remained
if
mother
did
not
smoke
(OR
801
95%
CI
120
533)
or
the
infant
was
breastfed
(OR
1310
95%
CI
129
133)
Bedsharing
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
SIDS
for
infants
<11
weeks
of
age
Sharing
a
couch
for
sleep
should
be
strongly
discouraged
at
any
age
