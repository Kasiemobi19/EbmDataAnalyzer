A
dose-ranging
study
of
a
new
once-daily
dual-component
drug
product
containing
niacin
extended-release
and
lovastatin
Abstract
Text
Combination
therapy
for
dyslipidemia
holds
promise
as
effective
treatment
for
patients
with
multiple
lipid
disorders
especially
those
at
high
risk
This
study
evaluated
dose-response
relationships
and
safety
of
a
new
dual-component
drug
product
containing
niacin
extended-release
(niacin
ER)
and
lovastatin
The
28-week
double-blind
multicenter
trial
randomized
237
patients
with
type
IIA
or
IIB
hyperlipidemia
to
one
of
four
escalating-dose
treatment
groups
niacin
ER/lovastatin
1000/20
mg
niacin
ER/lovastatin
2000/40
mg
niacin
ER
2000
mg
or
lovastatin
40
mg
Niacin
ER/lovastatin
was
more
effective
than
each
of
its
components
for
improving
levels
of
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C)
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
and
triglycerides
(TG)
and
exhibited
a
clear
dose-response
effect
and
additivity
across
the
dosage
range
The
2000/40
dose
achieved
greater
mean
reductions
in
LDL-C
(-42%)
than
1000/20
(-28%
p
<
0001)
lovastatin
40
mg
(-32%
p
<
005)
or
niacin
ER
2000
mg
(-14%
p
<
005)
The
2000/40
dose
was
significantly
more
effective
in
increasing
HDL-C
levels
(+30%)
than
the
1000/20
dose
(+21%
p
=
0016)
The
decrease
in
TG
was
greater
with
2000/40
(-43%)
than
with
1000/20
(-26%
p
=
0009)
All
three
niacin-containing
treatments
were
more
effective
than
lovastatin
monotherapy
in
reducing
lipoprotein
(a)
[Lp(a)]
levels
Flushing
caused
12
(11%)
patients
receiving
niacin
ER/lovastatin
and
I
patient
receiving
lovastatin
alone
to
withdraw
No
drug-related
myopathy
was
noted
One
patient
each
in
the
2000/40
group
and
the
lovastatin
40-mg
group
had
reversible
elevations
in
liver
transaminases
Niacin
ER/lovastatin
is
well
tolerated
and
effective
for
patients
with
multiple
lipid
disorders
