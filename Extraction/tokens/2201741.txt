Abstract
Text
To
determine
risk
factors
for
neonatal
group
B
streptococcal
(GBS)
disease
a
cohort
study
was
conducted
in
Atlanta
of
infants
with
invasive
GBS
disease
during
1982
and
1983
Laboratory
review
detected
71
infants
with
early-onset
disease
(109
cases/1000
live
births)
and
37
infants
with
late-onset
disease
(057
cases/1000
live
births)
Compared
with
the
64858
births
in
Atlanta
in
the
same
period
infants
with
early-onset
GBS
disease
were
more
often
black
less
than
2500
g
and
born
to
teenage
mothers
A
history
of
miscarriage
increased
a
woman's
risk
of
delivering
an
infant
with
early-onset
disease
Black
infants
had
35
times
the
risk
of
late-onset
disease
that
nonblack
infants
had
Thirty
percent
of
early-onset
disease
and
92%
of
late-onset
disease
could
be
attributed
to
black
race
independent
of
other
risk
factors
Most
case-mothers
(96%)
received
prenatal
care
suggesting
that
prevention
strategies
such
as
prenatal
screening
or
maternal
immunization
could
reach
nearly
all
the
population
at
risk
