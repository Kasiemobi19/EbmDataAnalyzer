Different
metabolic
predictors
of
white-coat
and
sustained
hypertension
over
a
20-year
follow-up
period
a

elderly
men
Abstract
Text
The
clinical
significance
of
white-coat
hypertension
is
still
unclear
Moreover
no
study
has
examined
metabolic
predictors
of
white-coat
versus
sustained
hypertension
We
investigated
men
(n=602)
in
a
longitudinal
population-based
cohort
who
at
age
70
years
were
identified
as
normotensive
white-coat
hypertensive
(office
blood
pressure
[BP]
>
or
=140/90
and
daytime
ambulatory
BP
<135/85
mm
Hg)
and
sustained
hypertensive
(office
BP
>
or
=140/90
and
daytime
ambulatory
BP
>
or
=135/85
mm
Hg)
At
baseline
when
the
subjects
were
aged
50
years
blood
glucose
insulin
lipids
and
fatty
acid
composition
of
the
serum
cholesterol
esters
were
analyzed
The
investigations
at
age
70
years
included
determination
of
insulin
sensitivity
and
target
organ
damage
At
age
50
years
individuals
who
20
years
later
were
identified
as
white-coat
hypertensive
or
sustained
hypertensive
showed
significantly
elevated
BP
heart
rate
and
impaired
glucose
tolerance
compared
with
normotensive
subjects
but
white
coat
hypertensive
subjects
were
leaner
and
had
a
more
favorable
serum
cholesterol
ester
fatty
acid
profile
than
did
sustained
hypertensive
subjects
At
age
70
years
both
white-coat
and
sustained
hypertensive
subjects
showed
an
impaired
insulin
sensitivity
elevated
blood
glucose
and
increased
serum
insulin
and
heart
rate
compared
with
normotensive
subjects
but
left
ventricular
mass
and
urinary
albumin
excretion
were
increased
only
in
sustained
hypertensive
subjects
These
findings
indicate
that
although
metabolic
abnormalities
and
elevated
heart
rate
were
consistent
over
time
in
both
hypertensive
groups
a
lower
body
mass
index
and
more
favorable
dietary
fat
composition
predicted
the
development
of
white-coat
as
opposed
to
sustained
hypertension
over
20
years
