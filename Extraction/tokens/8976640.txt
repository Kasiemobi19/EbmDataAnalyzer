Intra-articular

Abstract
Text
To
show
whether
intra-articular
steroid
injections
are
effective
in
osteoarthritis
to
determine
factors
that
predict
response
and
to
determine
whether
injection
has
a
beneficial
effect
on
muscle
strength
Double
blind
placebo
controlled
crossover
study
in
59
patients
with
symptomatic
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
Outcome
measure-Primary
outcome
measure
change
in
visual
analogue
score
for
pain
at
three
weeks
Predictors
of
response
analysed
using
logistic
regression
with
a
15%
decrease
in
pain
score
at
three
weeks
defining
response
Intra-articular
methyl
prednisolone
acetate
produced
a
significant
reduction
in
visual
analogue
pain
score
at
three
weeks
compared
to
both
baseline
(median
change
-20
mm
interquartile
range
-1625
to
40)
and
placebo
(median
00
mm
interquartile
range
-90
to
625)
No
clinical
predictors
of
response
could
be
identified
Muscle
strength
was
not
significantly
improved
in
the
short
term
by
intra-articular
injection
Intra-articular
corticosteroids
are
effective
for
short
term
relief
of
pain
in
osteoarthritis
but
predicting
responders
is
not
possible
There
may
be
a
place
for
their
more
widespread
use
