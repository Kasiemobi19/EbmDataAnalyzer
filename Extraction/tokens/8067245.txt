Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
of
a
new
administration
form
of
oxymetazoline
a
nasal
bellows
container
was
investigated
in
two
separate
studies
by
means
of
a
combined
treatment
with
phenoxymethyl-penicillin
for
acute
maxillary
sinusitis
In
the
first
study
(study
1)
oxymetazoline
administered
with
a
bellows
(OXBE)
was
compared
both
with
a
placebo
belows
(PLBE)
as
well
as
with
oxymetazoline
and
placebo
administered
with
a
conventional
nasal
spray
(OXSP
respective
PLSP)
in
73
patients
In
the
second
study
(study
2)
OXBE
was
compared
only
with
PLBE
in
48
patients
Objective
evaluation
was
made
by
comparing
the
radiographical
improvement
in
conventional
plain
sinus
X-ray
images
A
scoring
system
corresponding
to
the
outcome
of
antral
irrigation
was
used
for
evaluating
the
X-ray
pictures
Subjective
symptoms
nasal
stuffiness
and
pain
were
assessed
by
registrations
on
visual
analogue
scales
Neither
with
regard
to
radiographical
improvement
nor
to
decrease
in
subjective
symptoms
could
any
significant
differences
be
found
between
the
different
treatment
modes
Oxymetazoline
administered
with
a
nasal
bellows
thus
did
not
accelerate
the
rate
of
healing
of
acute
maxillary
sinusitis
in
these
two
studies
It
is
inferred
from
these
results
that
decongestion
of
the
sinus
ostia
is
not
of
primary
importance
for
the
course
of
healing
of
a
manifest
acute
sinusitis
