Calcium
supplementation
in
premenstrual
syndrome
a
randomized
crossover
trial
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
efficacy
of
calcium
supplementation
in
women
with
premenstrual
syndrome
(PMS)
Randomized
double-blind
crossover
trial
Outpatient
medical
clinic
of
a
large
city
hospital
Seventy-eight
women
were
initially
screened
Trial
selection
was
based
on
a
history
of
recurrent
PMS
symptoms
and
on
the
results
of
a
prospective
assessment
of
daily
symptom
scores
Only
women
with
symptom
scores
during
the
late
luteal
phase
that
were
at
least
50%
greater
than
those
during
the
intermenstrual
phase
were
selected
Thirty-three
women
completed
the
trial
A
preliminary
evaluation
included
physical
examination
routine
laboratory
tests
dietary
assessment
and
psychiatric
evaluation
Each
participant
received
six
months
of
treatment
involving
three
months
of
daily
calcium
supplementation
(1000
mg
of
calcium
carbonate)
and
three
months
of
placebo
Efficacy
was
assessed
prospectively
by
changes
in
daily
symptom
scores
over
a
six-month
period
and
retrospectively
by
an
overall
global
assessment
Multivariate
repeated
measures
analysis
of
variance
on
symptom
ratings
derived
from
daily
PMS
symptom
scores
demonstrated
a
reduction
in
symptoms
on
calcium
treatment
during
both
the
luteal
(p
=
0011)
and
the
menstrual
phases
(p
=
0032)
of
the
reproductive
cycle
Calcium
supplementation
had
no
effect
during
the
intermenstrual
phase
Retrospective
assessment
of
overall
symptoms
confirmed
this
reduction
73%
of
the
women
reported
fewer
symptoms
during
the
treatment
phase
on
calcium
15%
preferred
placebo
and
12%
had
no
clear
preference
Three
premenstrual
factors
(negative
affect
[p
=
0045]
water
retention
[p
=
0003]
pain
[p
=
0036])
and
one
menstrual
factor
(pain
[p
=
002])
were
significantly
alleviated
by
calcium
Calcium
supplementation
is
a
simple
and
effective
treatment
for
premenstrual
syndrome
but
further
studies
will
be
needed
to
determine
its
precise
role
in
PMS
