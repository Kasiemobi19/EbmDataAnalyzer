Title
Evaluation
of
acute
knee
pain
in
primary
care
Abstract
Text
The
evaluation
of
acute
knee
pain
often
includes
radiography
of
the
knee
To
synthesize
the
literature
to
determine
the
role
of
radiologic
procedures
in
evaluating
common
causes
of
acute
knee
pain
fractures
meniscal
or
ligamentous
injuries
osteoarthritis
and
pseudogout
MEDLINE
search
from
1966
to
October
2002
We
included
all
published
peer-reviewed
studies
of
decision
rules
for
fractures
We
included
studies
that
used
arthroscopy
as
the
gold
standard
for
measuring
the
accuracy
of
the
physical
examination
and
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI)
for
meniscal
and
ligamentous
knee
damage
We
included
all
studies
on
the
use
of
radiographs
in
pseudogout
We
extracted
all
data
in
duplicate
and
abstracted
physical
examination
and
MRI
results
into
2
x
2
tables
Among
the
5
decision
rules
for
deciding
when
to
use
plain
films
in
knee
fractures
the
Ottawa
knee
rules
(injury
due
to
trauma
and
age
>55
years
tenderness
at
the
head
of
the
fibula
or
the
patella
inability
to
bear
weight
for
4
steps
or
inability
to
flex
the
knee
to
90
degrees)
have
the
strongest
supporting
evidence
When
the
history
suggests
a
potential
meniscal
or
ligamentous
injury
the
physical
examination
is
moderately
sensitive
(meniscus
87%
anterior
cruciate
ligament
74%
and
posterior
cruciate
ligament
81%)
and
specific
(meniscus
92%
anterior
cruciate
ligament
95%
and
posterior
cruciate
ligament
95%)
The
Lachman
test
is
more
sensitive
and
specific
for
ligamentous
tears
than
is
the
drawer
sign
For
meniscal
tears
joint
line
tenderness
is
sensitive
(75%)
but
not
specific
(27%)
while
the
McMurray
test
is
specific
(97%)
but
not
sensitive
(52%)
Compared
with
the
physical
examination
MRI
is
more
sensitive
for
ligamentous
and
meniscal
damage
but
less
specific
When
the
differential
diagnosis
for
acute
knee
pain
includes
an
exacerbation
of
osteoarthritis
clinical
features
(age
>50
years
morning
stiffness
<30
minutes
crepitus
or
bony
enlargement)
are
89%
sensitive
and
88%
specific
for
underlying
chronic
arthritis
Adding
plain
films
improves
sensitivity
slightly
but
not
specificity
Plain
films
for
pseudogout
are
not
sensitive
or
specific
according
to
limited-quality
studies
We
recommend
the
Ottawa
knee
rules
to
decide
when
to
obtain
plain
films
for
suspected
knee
fracture
A
careful
physical
examination
should
be
sufficient
to
decide
whether
to
refer
patients
with
potential
meniscal
and
ligament
injuries
and
we
prefer
clinical
criteria
rather
than
plain
films
for
evaluating
osteoarthritis
We
do
not
recommend
using
plain
films
to
diagnose
pseudogout
