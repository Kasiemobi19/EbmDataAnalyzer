Clinical
risk
factors
for
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
in
children
Abstract
Text
To
identify
the
clinical
factor(s)
that
identify
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
syndrome
(OSAS)
in
children
A
prospective
study
of
children
referred
to
the
sleep
clinic
of
the
paediatric
department
was
conducted
in
a
public
non-teaching
regional
hospital
in
Hong
Kong
A
standard
questionnaire
was
administered
and
overnight
sleep
polysomnography
was
performed
in
a
consecutive
series
of
patients
Logistic
regression
analysis
was
performed
to
obtain
significant
risk
factors
for
prediction
of
OSAS
in
this
series
of
patients
Sixty-two
children
were
enrolled
into
the
study
and
22
were
diagnosed
to
have
OSAS
Logistic
regression
analysis
showed
that
among
all
the
answers
'snoring
every
night'
is
the
single
most
significant
risk
factor
(p<00001)
to
predict
OSAS
'Snoring
every
night'
has
a
sensitivity
of
91%
and
specificity
of
75%
for
OSAS
patients
It
also
has
a
positive
predictive
value
of
67%
and
negative
predictive
value
of
94%
Snoring
every
night
is
an
important
risk
factor
in
identifying
OSAS
in
children
Priority
for
an
overnight
sleep
polysomnogram
should
be
given
to
those
with
this
symptom
