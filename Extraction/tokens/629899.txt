Abstract
Text
Copper
intrauterine
contraceptive
devices
(IUCDs)
were
used
in
243
young
nulligravidae
attending
a
gynaecological
clinic
for
schoolgirls
in
Uppsala
between
March
1973
and
June
1975
226
of
these
girls
(93%)
were
seen
again
during
December
1975
making
a
total
of
3138
months
of
observation
At
the
time
of
follow
up
126
patients
(558%)
still
had
the
IUCD
in
situ
20%
had
expelled
the
IUCD
and
in
another
242%
the
IUCD
had
been
removed
because
of
bleeding
and/or
pain
or
because
of
suspected
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(7
patients)
Twelve
of
the
girls
conceived
during
the
period
of
observation
making
the
Pearl
index
46
nine
of
the
conceptions
occurred
within
nine
months
of
the
insertion
of
the
IUCD
Unlike
others
we
do
not
advocate
the
use
of
the
IUCD
for
young
nulligravidae
