Combination-therapy
with
bedtime
nph
insulin
and
sulphonylureas
gives
similar
glycaemic
control
but
lower
weight
gain
than
insulin
twice

in
patients

Abstract
Text
To
study
the
effect
on
body
weight
and
glycaemic
control
of
two
insulin
treatment
regimens
in
patients
with
Type
2
diabetes
and
moderate
failure
to
oral
hypoglycaemic
agents
Sixteen
patients
treated
with
oral
hypoglycaemic
agents
(6
men
and
10
women)
were
included
in
this
open-label
randomized
parallel
group
study
Their
age
was
62
+/-
2
(mean
+/-
SEM)
years
(range
44-79
years)
body
weight
713
+/-
29
kg
body
mass
index
(BMI)
246
+/-
08
kg/m(2)
The
patients
were
switched
to
insulin
treatment
with
bedtime
NPH
insulin
combined
with
daytime
sulphonylurea
(combination
group)
or
twice
daily
injections
of
a
premixed
combination
of
regular
human
and
NPH
insulin
(insulin
twice
daily
group)
with
measurements
as
given
below
before
and
after
12
and
24
weeks
of
treatment
HbA(1c)
was
lowered
from
83
+/-
03%
to
70
+/-
02%
in
the
insulin
twice
daily
group
(p<005)
and
from
83
+/-
03%
to
68
+/-
05%
in
the
combination
group
(p<003
ns
between
treatment
groups)
Body
weight
increased
from
717
+/-
40
kg
to
776
+/-
44
kg
in
the
insulin
twice
daily
group
(p<0001)
and
from
708
+/-
46
kg
to
727
+/-
51
kg
in
the
combination
group
(ns
p<002
between
groups)
The
dose
of
insulin
at
24
weeks
in
the
insulin
twice
daily
group
was
458
+/-
42
U
and
294
+/-
54
U
in
the
combination
group
(p=003)
Combination
treatment
reduced
fasting
and
stimulated
C-peptide
levels
Both
treatments
improved
glycaemic
control
to
the
same
extent
but
the
combination
of
bedtime
NPH
insulin
and
daytime
sulphonylurea
gave
a
very
small
increase
of
body
weight
over
a
6
months
period
We
conclude
that
combination
therapy
is
an
attractive
alternative
when
starting
insulin
treatment
in
patients
with
Type
2
diabetes
as
this
is
a
critical
period
for
weight
gain
in
such
patients
