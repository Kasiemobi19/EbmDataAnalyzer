Title
Consent
and
refusal
of
treatment
Abstract
Text
Clearly
a
multitude
of
potential
consent
problems
can
exist
for
the
emergency
physician
It
is
difficult
at
times
to
balance
the
concepts
of
patient
autonomy
with
the
desire
to
provide
optimal
medical
care
Experienced
emergency
physicians
should
be
able
to
individualize
the
type
of
consent
needed
in
a
particular
situation
based
on
a
clinical
evaluation
of
the
case
Some
general
principles
apply
but
no
strict
rules
can
guide
the
physician
in
every
case
Documentation
of
consent
and
refusal
of
treatment
are
critical
for
quality
of
patient
care
and
legal
liability
reasons
Principles
of
what
is
good
"appropriate"
legal
consent
usually
follow
from
good
medical
care
and
strict
concern
for
the
patient's
health
and
rights
