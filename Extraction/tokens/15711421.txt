Patients
with
elevated
baseline
liver
enzymes
do
not
have
higher
frequency
of
hepatotoxicity
from
lovastatin
than
those
with
normal
baseline
liver
enzymes
Abstract
Text
It
is
recommended
that
lovastatin
be
avoided
in
patients
with
unexplained
elevation
in
transaminase
levels
However
there
are
no
studies
that
evaluated
the
risk
of
lovastatin
hepatotoxicity
in
subjects
with
elevated
liver
enzymes
Our
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
patients
with
elevated
liver
enzymes
are
not
at
higher
risk
for
hepatotoxicity
from
lovastatin
Our
study
consisted
of
the
following
three
cohorts
of
patients
seen
between
December
1987
and
December
1998
cohort
1
135
patients
with
elevated
baseline
enzymes
(aspartate
transaminase
[AST]
>40
IU/L
or
alanine
transaminase
[ALT]
>35
IU/L)
who
received
lovastatin
cohort
2
620
patients
without
elevated
liver
enzymes
who
received
lovastatin
and
cohort
3
2644
patients
with
elevated
liver
enzymes
but
not
prescribed
lovastatin
Elevations
in
liver
biochemistries
over
a
12-month
period
after
lovastatin
was
prescribed
were
categorized
into
mild-moderate
or
severe
elevations
and
into
"Hy's
Rule"
based
on
published
criteria
The
incidence
of
mild-moderate
elevations
and
severe
elevations
in
liver
biochemistries
in
cohort
1
were
66%
and
0%
respectively
Compared
with
cohort
2
individuals
in
cohort
1
had
higher
incidence
of
mild-moderate
elevations
(66%
versus
3%
P
=
003)
but
not
severe
elevations
(0%
versus
03%
P
=
09)
Compared
with
cohort
3
patients
in
cohort
1
had
similar
mild-moderate
elevations
(66%
versus
11%
P
=
02)
but
lower
severe
elevations
(0%
versus
55%
P
<
001)
No
one
in
cohorts
1
or
2
developed
elevations
meeting
Hy's
Rule
whereas
35%
of
the
patients
in
cohort
3
exhibited
such
elevations
(P
<
005
versus
cohort
1
or
cohort
2)
Significant
hepatotoxicity
from
lovastatin
was
very
infrequent
in
this
study
and
individuals
with
elevated
baseline
liver
enzyme
levels
did
not
have
higher
frequency
of
lovastatin
hepatotoxicity
than
those
with
normal
liver
enzyme
levels
