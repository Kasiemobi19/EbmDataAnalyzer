Group
prenatal

a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
group
prenatal
care
improves
pregnancy
outcomes
psychosocial
function
and
patient
satisfaction
and
to
examine
potential
cost
differences
A
multisite
randomized
controlled
trial
was
conducted
at
two
university-affiliated
hospital
prenatal
clinics
Pregnant
women
aged
14-25
years
(n=1047)
were
randomly
assigned
to
either
standard
or
group
care
Women
with
medical
conditions
requiring
individualized
care
were
excluded
from
randomization
Group
participants
received
care
in
a
group
setting
with
women
having
the
same
expected
delivery
month
Timing
and
content
of
visits
followed
obstetric
guidelines
from
week
18
through
delivery
Each
2-hour
prenatal
care
session
included
physical
assessment
education
and
skills
building
and
support
through
facilitated
group
discussion
Structured
interviews
were
conducted
at
study
entry
during
the
third
trimester
and
postpartum
Mean
age
of
participants
was
204
years
80%
were
African
American
Using
intent-to-treat
analyses
women
assigned
to
group
care
were
significantly
less
likely
to
have
preterm
births
compared
with
those
in
standard
care
98%
compared
with
138%
with
no
differences
in
age
parity
education
or
income
between
study
conditions
This
is
equivalent
to
a
risk
reduction
of
33%
(odds
ratio
067
95%
confidence
interval
044-099
P=045)
or
40
per
1000
births
Effects
were
strengthened
for
African-American
women
100%
compared
with
158%
(odds
ratio
059
95%
confidence
interval
038-092
P=02)
Women
in
group
sessions
were
less
likely
to
have
suboptimal
prenatal
care
(P<01)
had
significantly
better
prenatal
knowledge
(P<001)
felt
more
ready
for
labor
and
delivery
(P<001)
and
had
greater
satisfaction
with
care
(P<001)
Breastfeeding
initiation
was
higher
in
group
care
665%
compared
with
546%
P<001
There
were
no
differences
in
birth
weight
nor
in
costs
associated
with
prenatal
care
or
delivery
Group
prenatal
care
resulted
in
equal
or
improved
perinatal
outcomes
at
no
added
cost
