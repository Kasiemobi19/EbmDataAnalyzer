The
outcome
of
treating

suspected
rebound
headache
Abstract
Text
To
prospectively
document
the
outcome
of
patients
suspected
of
having
rebound
headache
Previous
publications
on
rebound
headache
have
for
the
most
part
implied
that
the
patients
improve
but
have
failed
to
specify
the
percent
who
improved
the
pattern
of
improvement
or
the
end
point
that
is
achieved
This
was
a
prospective
study
of
50
consecutive
patients
presenting
with
chronic
daily
headache
of
over
2
months'
duration
who
were
suspected
of
having
rebound
headache
from
the
medications
that
they
were
using
for
pain
relief
and
who
were
eligible
to
follow
our
usual
treatment
protocol
ie
abrupt
termination
of
the
offending
medications
and
use
of
subcutaneous
injections
of
dihydroergotamine
for
excruciating
headache
One
year
after
the
initial
patient
was
enrolled
and
8
months
after
the
last
patient
was
enrolled
29
patients
(58%)
achieved
the
goal
of
6
or
more
consecutive
headache-free
days
the
mean
time
to
achieve
this
goal
was
84
days
Another
9
patients
showed
varying
degrees
of
improvement
1
continued
to
improve
and
achieved
5
consecutive
headache-free
days
after
having
omitted
her
medications
for
10
months
Eleven
patients
failed
to
stop
their
medications
or
stopped
their
medications
for
only
a
brief
interval
One
patient
continued
to
have
daily
headaches
after
having
essentially
omitted
all
pain
relief
medications
for
12
months
and
was
the
only
true
treatment
failure
in
the
group
Most
patients
suspected
of
having
rebound
headache
comply
with
the
instructions
to
omit
the
offending
agents
and
can
be
helped
This
information
might
help
other
physicians
who
are
treating
patients
suspected
of
having
rebound
headache
