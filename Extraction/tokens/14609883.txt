Efficacy
of
olanzapine
and
olanzapine-fluoxetine
combination
in
the
treatment
of
bipolar
I
depression
Abstract
Text
Despite
the
longer
duration
of
the
depressive
phase
in
bipolar
disorder
and
the
frequent
clinical
use
of
antidepressants
combined
with
antipsychotics
or
mood
stabilizers
relatively
few
controlled
studies
have
examined
treatment
strategies
for
bipolar
depression
To
examine
the
use
of
olanzapine
and
olanzapine-fluoxetine
combination
in
the
treatment
of
bipolar
I
depression
Double-blind
8-week
randomized
controlled
trial
Eighty-four
sites
(inpatient
and
outpatient)
in
13
countries
Patients
A
total
of
833
randomized
adults
with
bipolar
I
depression
with
a
Montgomery-Asberg
Depression
Rating
Scale
(MADRS)
score
of
at
least
20
Intervention
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
placebo
(n
=
377)
olanzapine
5
to
20
mg/d
(n
=
370)
or
olanzapine-fluoxetine
combination
6
and
25
6
and
50
or
12
and
50
mg/d
(n
=
86)
Changes
in
MADRS
total
scores
using
mixed-effects
model
repeated-measures
analyses
During
all
8
study
weeks
the
olanzapine
and
olanzapine-fluoxetine
groups
showed
statistically
significant
improvement
in
depressive
symptoms
vs
the
placebo
group
(P<001
for
all)
The
olanzapine-fluoxetine
group
also
showed
statistically
greater
improvement
than
the
olanzapine
group
at
weeks
4
through
8
At
week
8
MADRS
total
scores
were
lower
than
at
baseline
by
119
150
and
185
points
in
the
placebo
olanzapine
and
olanzapine-fluoxetine
groups
respectively
Remission
criteria
were
met
by
245%
(87/355)
of
the
placebo
group
328%
(115/351)
of
the
olanzapine
group
and
488%
(40/82)
of
the
olanzapine-fluoxetine
group
Treatment-emergent
mania
(Young
Mania
Rating
Scale
score
<15
at
baseline
and
>
or
=15
subsequently)
did
not
differ
among
groups
(placebo
67%
[23/345]
olanzapine
57%
[19/335]
and
olanzapine-fluoxetine
64%
[5/78])
Adverse
events
for
olanzapine-fluoxetine
therapy
were
similar
to
those
for
olanzapine
therapy
but
also
included
higher
rates
of
nausea
and
diarrhea
Olanzapine
is
more
effective
than
placebo
and
combined
olanzapine-fluoxetine
is
more
effective
than
olanzapine
and
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
bipolar
I
depression
without
increased
risk
of
developing
manic
symptoms
