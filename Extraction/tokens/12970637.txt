Double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
of
omeprazole
in
irritable
infants
with
gastroesophageal
reflux
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
efficacy
of
omeprazole
in
treating
irritable
infants
with
gastroesophageal
reflux
and/or
esophagitis
Irritable
infants
(n=30)
3
to
12
months
of
age
met
the
entry
criteria
of
esophageal
acid
exposure
>5%
(n=22)
and/or
abnormal
esophageal
histology
(n=15)
They
completed
a
4-week
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
crossover
trial
of
omeprazole
Cry/fuss
diary
(minutes/24
hours)
and
a
visual
analogue
scale
of
infant
irritability
as
judged
by
parental
impression
were
obtained
at
baseline
and
the
end
of
each
2-week
treatment
period
The
reflux
index
fell
significantly
during
omeprazole
treatment
compared
with
placebo
(-89%+/-56%
-19%+/-20%
P<001)
Cry/fuss
time
decreased
from
baseline
(267+/-119)
regardless
of
treatment
sequence
(period
1
203+/-99
P<04
period
2
188+/-121
P<008)
Visual
analogue
score
decreased
from
baseline
to
period
2
(68+/-16
48+/-29
P=008)
There
was
no
significant
difference
for
both
outcome
measures
while
taking
either
omeprazole
or
placebo
Compared
with
placebo
omeprazole
significantly
reduced
esophageal
acid
exposure
but
not
irritability
Irritability
improved
with
time
regardless
of
treatment
