Title
Microscopic
haematuria
as
a
predictor
of
urological
diseases
among
steel
workers
Abstract
Text
A
cohort
of
501
workers
in
a
steel
mill
in
Ontario
Canada
was
followed
up
from
1974
to
1986
for
13
years
Results
indicate
that
the
13-year
cumulative
incidence
of
urological
diseases
among
workers
who
had
a
positive
urinalysis
result
of
microscopic
haematuria
at
the
beginning
of
the
follow-up
period
(1974)
was
13
times
that
of
those
who
had
a
negative
urinalysis
result
(95%
confidence
interval
06-28)
This
relative
risk
remained
the
same
after
adjusting
for
age
and
smoking
This
indicates
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
urinary
screening
for
microscopic
haematuria
could
be
a
useful
predictor
of
urological
disease
occurrence
However
the
benefits
of
early
detection
and
management
were
difficult
to
demonstrate
Serious
urological
diseases
particularly
urinary
cancers
were
not
detected
earlier
as
a
result
of
the
urinary
screening
test
in
this
study
Several
studies
have
been
done
to
validate
the
test
in
the
past
More
work
to
validate
the
test
and
to
determine
the
predictive
accuracy
is
recommended
