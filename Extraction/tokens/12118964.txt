Abstract
Text
To
perform
a
systematic
review
of
the
cost-effectiveness
of
colorectal
cancer
screening
for
the
US
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
MEDLINE
and
the
British
National
Health
Service
Economic
Evaluation
Database
January
1993
through
September
2001
Original
economic
evaluations
of
colorectal
cancer
screening
in
average-risk
patients
were
reviewed
The
authors
sought
studies
addressing
the
incremental
cost-effectiveness
of
different
screening
strategies
compared
with
no
screening
of
different
screening
strategies
compared
with
one
another
and
of
different
ages
of
screening
initiation
and
cessation
Two
investigators
independently
reviewed
each
abstract
and
potentially
eligible
articles
were
retrieved
A
four-member
working
group
reached
consensus
regarding
final
inclusion
or
exclusion
of
articles
One
reviewer
extracted
data
into
evidence
tables
The
results
were
checked
by
other
members
and
discrepancies
resolved
by
consensus
Among
180
potential
articles
identified
7
were
retained
in
the
final
analysis
Compared
with
no
screening
cost-effectiveness
ratios
for
screening
with
any
of
the
commonly
considered
methods
were
generally
between
10
000
dollars
and
25
000
dollars
per
life-year
saved
No
one
strategy
was
consistently
found
to
be
the
most
effective
or
to
have
the
best
incremental
cost-effectiveness
ratio
Currently
available
models
provided
insufficient
evidence
to
determine
optimal
starting
and
stopping
ages
for
screening
Screening
for
colorectal
cancer
appears
cost-effective
compared
with
no
screening
but
a
single
optimal
strategy
cannot
be
determined
from
the
currently
available
data
Additional
data
regarding
adherence
with
screening
over
time
complication
rates
in
real-world
settings
and
colorectal
cancer
biology
are
needed
Additional
analyses
are
necessary
to
determine
optimal
ages
of
initiation
and
cessation
