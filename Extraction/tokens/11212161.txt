Two-year
effects
of
alendronate
on
bone
mineral
density
and
vertebral
fracture
in
patients
receiving
glucocorticoids
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
extension
trial
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
continued
efficacy
and
safety
of
alendronate
(ALN)
for
up
to
2
years
in
patients
receiving
glucocorticoids
This
is
a
12-month
extension
of
a
previously
completed
1-year
trial
of
daily
ALN
performed
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
ALN
over
a
total
of
2
years
in
66
men
and
142
women
continuing
to
receive
at
least
75
mg
of
prednisone
or
equivalent
daily
All
patients
received
supplemental
calcium
and
vitamin
D
The
primary
end
point
was
the
mean
percentage
change
in
lumbar
spine
bone
mineral
density
(BMD)
from
baseline
to
24
months
Other
outcomes
included
changes
in
hip
and
total
body
BMD
biochemical
markers
of
bone
turnover
radiographic
joint
damage
of
the
hands
and
vertebral
fracture
incidence
The
mean
(+/-SEM)
lumbar
spine
BMD
increased
by
28
+/-
06%
39
+/-
07%
and
37
+/-
06%
respectively
in
the
groups
that
received
5
mg
10
mg
and
25/10
mg
of
ALN
daily
(P
<
or
=
0001)
and
decreased
by
-08
+/-
06%
in
the
placebo
group
(P
not
significant)
over
24
months
In
patients
receiving
any
dose
of
ALN
BMD
was
increased
at
the
trochanter
(P
<
or
=
005)
and
maintained
at
the
femoral
neck
Total
body
BMD
was
increased
in
patients
receiving
5
or
10
mg
ALN
(P
<
or
=
001)
These
2
dose
levels
of
ALN
were
more
effective
than
placebo
at
all
sites
(P
<
or
=
005)
Bone
turnover
markers
(N-telopeptides
of
type
I
collagen
and
bone-specific
alkaline
phosphatase)
decreased
60%
and
25%
respectively
during
treatment
with
ALN
(P
<
or
=
005)
There
were
fewer
patients
with
new
vertebral
fractures
in
the
ALN
group
versus
the
placebo
group
(07%
versus
68%
P
=
0026)
The
safety
profile
was
similar
between
treatment
groups
Alendronate
is
an
effective
well-tolerated
therapy
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
glucocorticoid-induced
osteoporosis
with
sustained
treatment
advantages
for
up
to
2
years
