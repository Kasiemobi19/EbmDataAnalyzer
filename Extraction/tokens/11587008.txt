statement
Abstract
Text
A
panel
of
14
physicians
practicing
medicine
in
the
United
States
with
expertise
in
radiology
obstetrics
and
gynecology
gynecologic
oncology
hysteroscopy
epidemiology
and
pathology
was
convened
by
the
Society
of
Radiologists
in
Ultrasound
to
discuss
the
role
of
sonography
in
women
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
Broad
objectives
of
this
conference
were
(1)
to
advance
understanding
of
the
utility
of
different
diagnostic
techniques
for
evaluating
the
endometrium
in
women
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
(2)
to
formulate
useful
and
practical
guidelines
for
evaluation
of
women
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
specifically
as
it
relates
to
the
use
of
sonography
and
(3)
to
offer
suggestions
for
future
research
projects
October
24
and
25
2000
Washington
DC
preceding
the
annual
Society
of
Radiologists
in
Ultrasound
Advances
in
Sonography
conference
Specific
questions
to
the
panel
included
the
following
(1)
What
are
the
relative
effectiveness
and
cost-effectiveness
of
using
transvaginal
sonography
versus
office
(nondirected)
endometrial
biopsy
as
the
initial
examination
for
a
woman
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
(2)
What
are
the
sonographic
standards
for
evaluating
a
woman
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
(3)
What
are
the
abnormal
sonographic
findings
in
a
woman
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
(4)
When
should
saline
infusion
sonohysterography
or
hysteroscopy
be
used
in
the
evaluation
of
postmenopausal
bleeding
(5)
Should
the
diagnostic
approach
be
modified
for
patients
taking
hormone
replacement
medications
tamoxifen
or
other
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulators
Consensus
recommendations
were
used
to
create
an
algorithm
for
evaluating
women
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
All
panelists
agreed
that
because
postmenopausal
bleeding
is
the
most
common
presenting
symptom
of
endometrial
cancer
when
postmenopausal
bleeding
occurs
clinical
evaluation
is
indicated
The
panelists
also
agreed
that
either
transvaginal
sonography
or
endometrial
biopsy
could
be
used
safely
and
effectively
as
the
first
diagnostic
step
Whether
sonography
or
endometrial
biopsy
is
used
initially
depends
on
the
physician's
assessment
of
patient
risk
the
nature
of
the
physician's
practice
the
availability
of
high-quality
sonography
and
patient
preference
Similar
sensitivities
for
detecting
endometrial
carcinoma
are
reported
for
transvaginal
sonography
when
an
endometrial
thickness
of
greater
than
5
mm
is
considered
abnormal
and
for
endometrial
biopsy
when
"sufficient"
tissue
is
obtained
Currently
with
respect
to
mortality
morbidity
and
quality-of-life
end
points
there
are
insufficient
data
to
comment
as
to
which
approach
is
more
effective
The
conference
concluded
by
identifying
several
important
unanswered
questions
and
suggestions
that
could
be
addressed
by
future
research
projects
