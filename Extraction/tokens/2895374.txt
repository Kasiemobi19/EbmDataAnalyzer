Reliability
of
eliciting
physical
signs
in
examination
of
the
chest
Abstract
Text
Agreement
between
24
physicians
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
respiratory
signs
was
investigated
The
physicians
were
divided
into
six
sets
of
4
each
set
examined
4
patients
with
well-defined
chest
signs
There
was
generally
poor
agreement
about
particular
signs
Overall
the
4
physicians
in
a
set
were
in
complete
agreement
only
55%
of
the
time
Some
signs
such
as
wheezing
seemed
to
be
more
reliably
elicited
than
others
such
as
whispering
pectoriloquy
Comparison
of
diagnoses
based
on
the
clinical
findings
with
the
correct
diagnoses
supported
by
investigations
showed
that
28%
of
physicians'
diagnoses
were
incorrect
The
more
often
the
examiners
differed
from
the
majority
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
sign
the
more
likely
they
were
to
make
an
incorrect
diagnosis
A
ranked
order
of
the
reliability
with
which
chest
signs
are
elicited
would
improve
the
teaching
of
chest
medicine
