Feasibility

Abstract
Text
An
attempt
was
made
to
improve
the
control
of
blood
glucose
in
patients
with
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
Ten
patients
were
studied
over
a
period
exceeding
8
mo
in
the
outpatient
department
Each
patient
was
taught
to
monitor
his
or
her
own
blood
glucose
concentration
and
was
enrolled
in
an
exercise
program
In
addition
they
were
taught
to
calibrate
insulin
food
and
exercise
in
terms
of
the
response
of
the
blood
glucose
After
3
mo
of
study
there
was
a
significant
decrease
in
hemoglobin
A1c
(Hb
A1c)
values
from
a
mean
concentration
of
103
to
76%
Hb
A1c
values
correlated
well
with
mean
blood
glucose
levels
(r
=
086)
Dietary
analysis
revealed
that
the
patients
selected
a
diet
consisting
of
25%
protein
44%
fat
and
31%
carbohydrate
but
there
was
a
wide
range
in
caloric
distribution
There
was
no
correlation
between
blood
glucose
control
as
measured
by
Hb
A1c
and
caloric
distribution
Systolic
blood
pressures
decreased
greater
than
10
mm
Hg
Serum
alkaline
phosphatase
also
decreased
in
each
patient
as
control
of
blood
glucose
improved
Three
of
the
patients
with
abnormalities
of
nerve
conduction
measurement
at
the
beginning
of
the
study
had
a
complete
return
to
normal
at
8
mo
An
outpatient
program
such
as
this
may
be
cost
effective
through
the
avoidance
of
diabetes-related
hospitalizations
and
may
provide
a
mechanism
whereby
larger
studies
can
be
designed
to
define
further
the
relationship
of
glycemia
to
the
sequelae
of
diabetes
