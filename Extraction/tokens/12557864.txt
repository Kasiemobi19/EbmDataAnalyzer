Balloon
angioplasty
or
medical
therapy
for
hypertensive
patients
with
atherosclerotic

stenosis
A
meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
Abstract
Text
The
optimal
treatment
for
hypertensive
patients
with
atherosclerotic
renal
artery
stenosis
is
controversial
We
performed
a
meta-analysis
comparing
the
effects
of
balloon
angioplasty
and
medical
therapy
in
these
patients
We
searched
MEDLINE
EMBASE
the
Science
Citation
Index
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Registry
and
reference
lists
Authors
of
published
trials
were
contacted
We
identified
three
trials
involving
a
total
of
210
patients
with
moderate-to-severe
(>
or
=
50%)
unilateral
or
bilateral
atherosclerotic
renal
artery
stenosis
and
poorly
controlled
hypertension
who
were
followed
for
at
least
3
months
after
intervention
Balloon
angioplasty
was
significantly
more
effective
in
reducing
blood
pressure
than
was
medical
therapy
the
weighted
mean
difference
between
the
two
treatments
was
-7
mm
Hg
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
-12
to
-1
mm
Hg)
for
systolic
blood
pressure
and
-3
mm
Hg
(95%
CI
-6
to
-1
mm
Hg)
for
diastolic
blood
pressure
There
was
no
consistent
difference
in
changes
in
renal
function
Patients
treated
with
balloon
angioplasty
were
more
likely
to
have
patent
renal
arteries
after
12
months
(52%
vs
19%
odds
ratio
[OR]
=
42
95%
CI
18
to
98)
used
fewer
antihypertensive
medications
and
appeared
to
have
fewer
major
cardiovascular
and
renovascular
complications
(OR
=
027
95%
CI
006
to
123
P
=
009)
Balloon
angioplasty
has
a
modest
but
significant
effect
on
blood
pressure
and
should
be
considered
for
patients
with
atherosclerotic
renal
artery
stenosis
and
poorly
controlled
hypertension
There
is
no
evidence
supporting
its
use
in
improving
or
preserving
renal
function
although
none
of
the
trials
were
designed
to
address
this
issue
