Abstract
Text
In
a
study
using
a
split-sample
design
liquid-based
cytology
(ThinPrep
Processor
Cytyc
Corporation
Boxborough
MA)
was
compared
with
the
conventional
Papanicolaou
(Pap)
smear
in
Guanacaste
Costa
Rica
The
study
provides
the
first
population-based
comparison
of
the
ThinPrep
screening
technology
and
includes
"gold
standard"
measures
of
diagnostic
accuracy
The
population-based
study
was
performed
among
over
8000
women
residing
in
a
Costa
Rican
province
with
a
high
incidence
of
cervical
carcinoma
Conventional
smears
were
prepared
and
diagnosed
in
Costa
Rica
while
the
residual
material
on
the
sampling
device
was
collected
into
a
liquid
preservative
and
shipped
to
the
US
where
ThinPrep
cytologic
slides
were
prepared
and
diagnosed
Cytologic
diagnoses
based
on
the
two
techniques
categorized
according
to
the
Bethesda
System
were
compared
with
a
"gold
standard"
final
case
diagnosis
for
each
patient
also
based
on
Bethesda
terminology
that
reflected
an
integrated
interpretation
of
all
available
data
including
cytology
histology
and
cervicography
Results
were
also
compared
with
the
results
of
HPV
DNA
detection
(Hybrid
Capture
Digene
Corporation
Silver
Spring
MD)
ASCUS
was
the
threshold
for
colposcopy
referral
There
were
significantly
more
women
referred
according
to
this
threshold
with
the
ThinPrep
slide
(127%)
than
with
the
conventional
smear
(67%
P<0001)
Compared
with
the
final
case
diagnosis
referral
by
ThinPrep
slides
detected
929%
of
cases
with
high
grade
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
(HSIL)
and
100%
of
carcinoma
cases
Smears
detected
778%
of
HSIL
and
909%
of
carcinomas
Thus
ThinPrep
cytology
was
significantly
more
sensitive
in
the
detection
of
HSIL
and
cancer
(McNemar
test
P<0001)
Adjudication
of
cases
in
which
the
ThinPrep
and
smear
diagnoses
disagreed
using
the
final
case
diagnoses
and
the
HPV
DNA
test
results
as
reference
standards
suggested
that
the
ThinPrep
method
was
detecting
additional
true
SIL
as
opposed
to
false-positives
In
a
population-based
study
of
high
risk
women
ThinPrep
cytology
demonstrated
significantly
increased
sensitivity
for
detecting
HSIL
and
carcinoma
with
a
concurrent
significant
increase
in
colposcopy
referrals
