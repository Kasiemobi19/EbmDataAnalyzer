Title
Antibiotics
for
whooping
cough
(pertussis)
Abstract
Text
Whooping
cough
is
a
highly
contagious
disease
Infants
are
the
population
at
highest
risk
of
severe
disease
and
death
Erythromycin
for
14
days
is
recommended
for
treatment
and
contact
prophylaxis
but
this
regime
is
considered
inconvenient
and
prolonged
The
value
of
contact
prophylaxis
is
uncertain
To
study
the
benefits
and
risks
of
antibiotic
treatment
of
and
contact
prophylaxis
against
whooping
cough
The
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials

conference
abstracts
and
reference
lists
of
articles
were
searched
Study
investigators
and
pharmaceutical
companies
were
approached
for
additional
information
(published
or
unpublished
studies)
There
were
no
constraints
based
on
language
or
publication
status
All
randomised
and
quasi-randomised
controlled
trials
of
antibiotics
for
treatment
of
and
contact
prophylaxis
against
whooping
cough
were
included
in
the
systematic
review
At
least
three
reviewers
independently
extracted
data
and
assessed
the
quality
of
each
trial
Twelve
trials
with
1720
participants
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Ten
trials
investigated
treatment
regimens
and
two
investigated
prophylaxis
regimens
The
quality
of
the
trials
was
variable
Results
showed
that
short-term
antibiotics
(azithromycin
for
three
days
clarithromycin
for
seven
days
or
erythromycin
estolate
for
seven
days)
were
equally
effective
with
long-term
antibiotic
treatment
(erythromycin
estolate
or
erythromycin
for
14
days)
in
the
microbiological
eradication
of
Bordetella
pertussis
(B
pertussis)
from
the
nasopharynx
The
relative
risk
(RR)
was
102
(95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
098
to
105)
Side
effects
were
fewer
with
short-term
treatment
(RR
066
95%
CI
052
to
083)
There
were
no
differences
in
clinical
improvement
or
microbiological
relapse
between
short
and
long-term
treatment
regimens
Contact
prophylaxis
(of
contacts
older
than
six
months
of
age)
with
antibiotics
did
not
significantly
improve
clinical
symptoms
or
the
number
of
cases
that
developed
culture
positive
B
pertussis
Antibiotics
are
effective
in
eliminating
B
pertussis
from
patients
with
the
disease
rendering
them
non-infectious
but
do
not
alter
the
subsequent
clinical
course
of
the
illness
Effective
regimens
include
three
days
of
azithromycin
seven
days
of
clarithromycin
seven
or
14
days
of
erythromycin
estolate
and
14
days
of
erythromycin
ethylsuccinate
Considering
microbiological
clearance
and
side
effects
three
days
of
azithromycin
or
seven
days
of
clarithromycin
are
the
best
regimens
Seven
days
of
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
also
appeared
to
be
effective
for
the
eradication
of
B
pertussis
from
the
nasopharynx
and
may
serve
as
an
alternative
antibiotic
treatment
for
patients
who
cannot
tolerate
a
macrolide
There
is
insufficient
evidence
to
determine
the
benefit
of
prophylactic
treatment
of
pertussis
contacts
