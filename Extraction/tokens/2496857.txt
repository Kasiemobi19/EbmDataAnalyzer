and

published
data
Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
association
between
cigarette
smoking
in
adults
and
serum
lipid
and
lipoprotein
concentrations
the
results
of
54
published
studies
were
analysed
Overall
smokers
had
significantly
higher
serum
concentrations
of
cholesterol
(30%)
triglycerides
(91%)
very
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(104%)
and
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(17%)
and
lower
serum
concentrations
of
high
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(-57%)
and
apolipoprotein
AI
(-42%)
compared
with
nonsmokers
Among
non-smokers
and
light
moderate
and
heavy
smokers
a
significant
dose
response
effect
was
present
for
cholesterol
(0
18
43
and
45%
respectively)
triglycerides
(0
107
115
and
180%)
very
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(0
72
444
and
390%)
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(0
-11
14
and
110%)
high
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(0
-46
-63
and
-89%)
and
apolipoprotein
AI
(0
-37
and
-57%
in
non-smokers
and
light
and
heavy
smokers)
These
dose
response
effects
may
provide
new
evidence
for
a
causal
relation
between
exposure
to
cigarette
smoke
and
changes
in
serum
lipid
and
lipoprotein
concentrations
whether
as
a
direct
result
of
physiological
changes
or
of
dietary
changes
induced
by
smoking
Adequate
prospective
data
to
estimate
the
excess
risk
of
coronary
artery
disease
existed
only
for
cholesterol
concentration
When
that
information
was
combined
with
data
from
the
present
study
and
given
that
smokers
as
a
group
face
an
average
overall
excess
risk
of
coronary
artery
disease
of
70%
it
was
estimated
that
the
observed
increased
serum
cholesterol
concentration
in
smokers
may
account
for
at
least
9%
of
that
excess
risk
Furthermore
the
dose
response
effect
of
smoking
on
serum
cholesterol
concentration
suggests
a
gradient
of
increased
absolute
risk
of
coronary
artery
disease
between
light
and
heavy
smokers
