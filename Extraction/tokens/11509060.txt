Title
Risk
of
cardiovascular
events
associated
with
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
Abstract
Text
Atherosclerosis
is
a
process
with
inflammatory
features
and
selective
cyclooxygenase
2
(COX-2)
inhibitors
may
potentially
have
antiatherogenic
effects
by
virtue
of
inhibiting
inflammation
However
by
decreasing
vasodilatory
and
antiaggregatory
prostacyclin
production
COX-2
antagonists
may
lead
to
increased
prothrombotic
activity
To
define
the
cardiovascular
effects
of
COX-2
inhibitors
when
used
for
arthritis
and
musculoskeletal
pain
in
patients
without
coronary
artery
disease
we
performed
a
MEDLINE
search
to
identify
all
English-language
articles
on
use
of
COX-2
inhibitors
published
between
1998
and
February
2001
We
also
reviewed
relevant
submissions
to
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
by
pharmaceutical
companies
Our
search
yielded
2
major
randomized
trials
the
Vioxx
Gastrointestinal
Outcomes
Research
Study
(VIGOR
8076
patients)
and
the
Celecoxib
Long-term
Arthritis
Safety
Study
(CLASS
8059
patients)
as
well
as
2
smaller
trials
with
approximately
1000
patients
each
The
results
from
VIGOR
showed
that
the
relative
risk
of
developing
a
confirmed
adjudicated
thrombotic
cardiovascular
event
(myocardial
infarction
unstable
angina
cardiac
thrombus
resuscitated
cardiac
arrest
sudden
or
unexplained
death
ischemic
stroke
and
transient
ischemic
attacks)
with
rofecoxib
treatment
compared
with
naproxen
was
238
(95%
confidence
interval
139-400
P
=002)
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
cardiovascular
event
(myocardial
infarction
stroke
and
death)
rates
between
celecoxib
and
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
agents
in
CLASS
The
annualized
myocardial
infarction
rates
for
COX-2
inhibitors
in
both
VIGOR
and
CLASS
were
significantly
higher
than
that
in
the
placebo
group
of
a
recent
meta-analysis
of
23
407
patients
in
primary
prevention
trials
(052%)
074%
with
rofecoxib
(P
=04
compared
with
the
placebo
group
of
the
meta-analysis)
and
080%
with
celecoxib
(P
=02
compared
with
the
placebo
group
of
the
meta-analysis)
The
available
data
raise
a
cautionary
flag
about
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
events
with
COX-2
inhibitors
Further
prospective
trial
evaluation
may
characterize
and
determine
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
