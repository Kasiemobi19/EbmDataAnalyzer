Title
Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
for
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
Abstract
Text
Heavy
menstrual
bleeding
(HMB)
is
an
important
cause
of
ill
health
in
premenopausal
women
Although
surgery
is
often
used
as
a
treatment
a
range
of
medical
therapies
are
also
available
Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
reduce
prostaglandin
levels
which
are
elevated
in
women
with
excessive
menstrual
bleeding
and
also
may
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
dysmenorrhoea
The
primary
objective
of
this
review
was
to
investigate
the
effectiveness
of
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
in
achieving
a
reduction
in
menstrual
blood
loss
in
women
of
reproductive
years
HMB

We
also
contacted
manufacturers
and
researchers
in
the
field
The
inclusion
criteria
were
randomised
comparisons
of
individual
NSAIDs
with
either
each
other
placebo
or
other
medical
treatments
in
women
with
regular
heavy
periods
measured
either
objectively
or
subjectively
and
with
no
pathological
or
iatrogenic
(treatment
induced)
causes
for
their
heavy
menstrual
blood
loss
Seventeen
RCTs
were
identified
that
fulfilled
the
inclusion
criteria
for
this
review
and
data
were
extracted
independently
Odds
ratios
for
dichotomous
outcomes
and
weighted
mean
differences
for
continuous
outcomes
were
estimated
from
the
data
of
nine
trials
The
results
of
the
remaining
seven
crossover
trials
with
data
unsuitable
for
pooling
and
one
trial
with
skewed
data
were
described
in
the
Other
Data
section
As
a
group
NSAIDs
were
more
effective
than
placebo
at
reducing
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
but
less
effective
than
either
tranexamic
acid
danazol
or
the
levonorgestrel
releasing
intrauterine
system
(LNG
IUS)
Treatment
with
danazol
caused
a
shorter
duration
of
menstruation
and
more
adverse
events
than
NSAIDs
but
this
did
not
appear
to
affect
the
acceptability
of
treatment
There
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
between
NSAIDs
and
the
other
treatments
(oral
luteal
progestogen
ethamsylate
an
older
progesterone
releasing
intra-uterine
system
(Progestasert)
oral
contraceptive
pill
(OCC))
but
most
studies
were
underpowered
There
was
no
evidence
of
a
difference
between
the
individual
NSAIDs
(naproxen
and
mefenamic
acid)
in
reducing
HMB
NSAIDs
reduce
HMB
when
compared
with
placebo
but
are
less
effective
than
either
tranexamic
acid
danazol
or
LNG
IUS
However
adverse
events
are
more
severe
with
danazol
therapy
In
the
limited
number
of
small
studies
suitable
for
evaluation
no
significant
difference
in
efficacy
was
demonstrated
between
NSAIDs
and
other
medical
treatments
such
as
oral
luteal
progestogen
ethamsylate
OCC
or
another
type
of
IUS
Progestasert
