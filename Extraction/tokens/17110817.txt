Efficacy

in
bipolar

depression
a

study)
Abstract
Text
This
study
evaluated
the
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
quetiapine
monotherapy
for
depressive
episodes
in
patients
with
bipolar
I
or
II
disorder
(Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manual
of
Mental
Disorders
Fourth
Edition)
who
were
randomized
to
8
weeks
of
double-blind
treatment
with
quetiapine
(300
or
600
mg/d
once
daily
evening
dosing)
or
placebo
Patients
were
assessed
weekly
using
the
Montgomery-Asberg
Depression
Rating
Scale
(MADRS)
and
Hamilton
Depression
Rating
Scale
(HAM-D)
The
primary
end
point
was
change
in
MADRS
total
score
from
baseline
to
Week
8
(analysis
of
covariance/last-observation-carried-forward
analysis)
Of
509
patients
randomized
59%
completed
the
study
Improvements
from
baseline
in
mean
MADRS
total
scores
were
significantly
greater
with
quetiapine
300
and
600
mg/d
than
with
placebo
from
first
evaluation
(Week
1)
through
Week
8
(both
P
<or=
0001
vs
placebo)
Therapeutic
effect
sizes
at
Week
8
were
061
and
054
for
quetiapine
300
and
600
mg/d
respectively
Improvements
in
mean
HAM-D
scores
were
also
significantly
greater
with
both
quetiapine
doses
than
with
placebo
(P
<
0001)
as
early
as
Week
1
and
throughout
the
study
The
MADRS
response
and
remission
rates
were
also
significantly
greater
in
both
quetiapine
dose
groups
compared
with
placebo
Improvements
in
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
were
observed
with
both
300
and
600
mg/d
quetiapine
without
major
differences
between
the
doses
Common
adverse
events
included
dry
mouth
sedation
somnolence
dizziness
and
constipation
The
incidence
of
treatment-emergent
mania
or
hypomania
was
lower
with
quetiapine
treatment
than
placebo
This
study
demonstrates
that
quetiapine
monotherapy
is
an
effective
and
well-tolerated
treatment
for
depressive
episodes
in
bipolar
disorder
confirming
the
results
observed
from
a
previous
study
