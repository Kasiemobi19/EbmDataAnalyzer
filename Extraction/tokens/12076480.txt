Title
Dietary
fibre
for
the
prevention
of
colorectal
adenomas
and
carcinomas
Abstract
Text
Colorectal
cancer
(CRC)
is
a
major
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
industrialized
countries
Experimental
evidence
has
supported
the
hypothesis
that
dietary
fibre
may
be
protective
for
the
development
of
CRC
although
epidemiologic
data
have
been
inconclusive
We
have
conducted
a
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
to
assess
the
effect
of
dietary
fibre
on
the
incidence
or
recurrence
of
colorectal
adenomas
the
incidence
of
CRC
and
the
development
of
adverse
events
We
identified
randomized
controlled
trials
from
Medline
Embase
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
up
to
Oct
2001

Randomized
or
quasi-randomized
controlled
trials
were
assessed
The
population
included
all
subjects
that
had
adenomatous
polyps
but
no
previous
history
of
colorectal
cancer
(CRC)
a
documented
"clean
colon"
at
baseline
and
repeated
visualization
of
the
colon/rectum
after
at
least
two
years
of
follow-up
Dietary
fibre
was
the
intervention
The
primary
outcomes
were
the
number
of
subjects
with
a)
at
least
one
adenoma
b)
more
than
one
adenoma
c)
at
least
one
adenoma
greater
than
or
equal
to
1
cm
or
d)
a
new
diagnosis
of
CRC
The
secondary
outcome
was
the
number
of
adverse
events
Two
reviewers
independently
extracted
data
assessed
trial
quality
and
resolved
discrepancies
by
consensus
The
outcomes
were
reported
as
relative
risks
(RR)
and
risk
difference
(RD)
with
95%
confidence
intervals
(CI)
If
statistical
significance
was
reached
the
number
need
to
treat
(NNTT)
or
harm
(NNTH)
was
reported
The
study
data
were
combined
with
the
fixed
effects
model
if
it
was
clinically
methodologically
and
statistically
reasonable
Five
studies
with
4349
subjects
met
the
inclusion
criteria
The
interventions
were
wheat
bran
fibre
ispaghula
husk
or
a
comprehensive
dietary
intervention
with
high
fibre
whole
food
sources
alone
or
in
combination
When
the
data
were
combined
there
was
no
difference
between
the
intervention
and
control
groups
for
the
number
of
subjects
with
at
least
one
adenoma
[RR
104
(95%
CI
095113)
RD
001
(95%
CI
002004)]
As
well
the
combined
results
for
the
number
of
subjects
with
more
than
one
adenoma
[RR
102
(95%
CI
089117)
RD
000
(-002003)]
or
at
least
one
adenoma
1
cm
or
greater
[RR
094
(95%
CI
077115)
RD
-001
(-002001)]
were
not
statistically
significant
Other
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
and
subanalyses
by
type
of
fibre
intervention
were
not
statistically
or
clinically
significant
There
is
currently
no
evidence
from
RCTs
to
suggest
that
increased
dietary
fibre
intake
will
reduce
the
incidence
or
recurrence
of
adenomatous
polyps
within
a
two
to
four
year
period
