Women's
early
warning
symptoms
of
acute
myocardial
infarction
Abstract
Text
Data
remain
sparse
on
women's
prodromal
symptoms
before
acute
myocardial
infarction
(AMI)
This
study
describes
prodromal
and
AMI
symptoms
in
women
Participants
were
515
women
diagnosed
with
AMI
from
5
sites
Using
the
McSweeney
Acute
and
Prodromal
Myocardial
Infarction
Symptom
Survey
we
surveyed
them
4
to
6
months
after
discharge
asking
about
symptoms
comorbidities
and
demographic
characteristics
Women
were
predominantly
white
(93%)
high
school
educated
(548%)
and
older
(mean
age
66+/-12)
with
95%
(n=489)
reporting
prodromal
symptoms
The
most
frequent
prodromal
symptoms
experienced
more
than
1
month
before
AMI
were
unusual
fatigue
(707%)
sleep
disturbance
(478%)
and
shortness
of
breath
(421%)
Only
297%
reported
chest
discomfort
a
hallmark
symptom
in
men
The
most
frequent
acute
symptoms
were
shortness
of
breath
(579%)
weakness
(548%)
and
fatigue
(429%)
Acute
chest
pain
was
absent
in
43%
Women
had
more
acute
(mean
73+/-48
range
0
to
29)
than
prodromal
(mean
571+/-436
range
0
to
25)
symptoms
The
average
prodromal
score
symptom
weighted
by
frequency
and
intensity
was
585+/-527
whereas
the
average
acute
score
symptom
weighted
by
intensity
was
165+/-121
These
2
scores
were
correlated
(r=061
P<0001)
Women
with
more
prodromal
symptoms
experienced
more
acute
symptoms
After
controlling
for
risk
factors
prodromal
scores
accounted
for
332%
of
acute
symptomatology
Most
women
have
prodromal
symptoms
before
AMI
It
remains
unknown
whether
prodromal
symptoms
are
predictive
of
future
events
