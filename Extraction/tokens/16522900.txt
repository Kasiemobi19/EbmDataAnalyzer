Breastfeeding
introduction
of
complementary
foods
and
adiposity
at
5
y
of
age
Abstract
Text
Although
dual-energy
X-ray
absorptiometry
(DXA)
is
considered
the
most
accurate
measure
of
adiposity
in
children
it
has
rarely
been
used
to
examine
the
relation
between
infant
feeding
and
adiposity
during
childhood
The
objective
was
to
ascertain
whether
adiposity
at
age
5
y
was
related
to
breastfeeding
to
the
timing
of
the
introduction
of
complementary
foods
during
infancy
or
to
both
Body
composition
was
measured
in
313
children
at
age
5
y
by
using
DXA
Data
on
breastfeeding
formula
feeding
and
the
timing
of
the
introduction
of
complementary
foods
were
obtained
from
the
mothers
when
the
children
were
3
y
old
Regression
analysis
was
used
to
examine
the
relation
between
infant
feeding
and
fat
mass
after
adjustment
for
lean
body
mass
sex
birth
weight
maternal
obesity
race
and
other
sociodemographic
variables
Fifty-three
percent
of
the
children
were
boys
80%
were
white
and
20%
were
black
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
adjusted
fat
mass
between
those
ever
breastfed
and
those
never
breastfed
(x
+/-
SE
448
+/-
009
and
476
+/-
017
kg
respectively
P
=
017)
Children
who
were
breastfed
for
a
longer
duration
and
those
who
were
breastfed
without
concurrent
formula
feeding
did
not
have
significantly
lower
fat
mass
than
did
those
children
who
were
never
breastfed
Children
did
not
differ
significantly
in
fat
mass
if
they
were
introduced
to
complementary
foods
before
or
after
4
mo
of
age
(449
+/-
012
and
463
+/-
012
kg
respectively
P
=
042)
Neither
breastfeeding
nor
the
timing
of
the
introduction
of
complementary
foods
was
associated
with
adiposity
at
age
5
y
