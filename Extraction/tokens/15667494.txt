study
Abstract
Text
Chronic
constipation
is
a
common
persistent
disorder
with
limited
effective
treatment
options
This
study
investigated
the
efficacy
safety
and
tolerability
of
tegaserod
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
constipation
After
a
2-wk
baseline
period
patients
were
randomized
to
double-blind
treatment
of
12
wk
with
tegaserod
(2
or
6
mg
bid)
or
placebo
Response
during
weeks
1-4
(primary
variable)
was
defined
as
an
increase
in
complete
spontaneous
bowel
movement
(CSBM)/wk
Secondary
variables
included
response
during
weeks
1-12
patient
evaluation
of
individual
symptoms
and
global
assessment
of
bowel
habits
and
constipation
One
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixty-four
patients
were
randomized
to
tegaserod
or
placebo
Responder
rates
for
the
primary
efficacy
variable
were
356%
for
tegaserod
2
mg
bid
(p=
00059
vs
placebo)
402%
for
6
mg
bid
(p
<
00001
vs
placebo)
and
267%
for
placebo
The
number
needed
to
treat
was
73
for
the
6
mg
bid
dose
compared
with
111
for
tegaserod
2
mg
bid
Tegaserod
6
mg
bid
reduced
straining
abdominal
bloating/distension
and
abdominal
pain/discomfort
during
the
12-wk
treatment
period
compared
with
placebo
(p
<
005
for
all
symptoms)
Significant
improvements
were
also
seen
in
stool
form
and
in
global
assessment
of
bowel
habits
and
constipation
The
most
common
adverse
events
headache
and
abdominal
pain
were
more
frequent
with
placebo
than
with
tegaserod
Tegaserod
was
efficacious
in
relieving
symptoms
of
chronic
constipation
and
was
well
tolerated
