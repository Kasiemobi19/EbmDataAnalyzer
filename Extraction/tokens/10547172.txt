New
profiles
of
diabetic
ketoacidosis
type
1
vs
type
2
diabetes
and
the
effect
of
ethnicity
Abstract
Text
Diabetic
ketoacidosis
(DKA)
has
been
reported
to
occur
in
type
2
diabetes
but
the
frequency
and
distinguishing
features
of
this
syndrome
remain
to
be
defined
We
determined
the
"diabetic
types"
ethnic
distributions
and
phenotypes
of
patients
with
DKA
in
an
urban
hospital
We
reviewed
the
hospital
admissions
and
followed
the
clinical
course
of
adults
who
developed
DKA
We
classified
patients
as
"type
1"
"type
2"
or
"new
onset"
based
on
their
treatment
history
New-onset
patients
were
reassessed
2
1/2
years
or
more
after
the
episode
of
DKA
and
classified
as
"type
1"
or
"type
2"
based
on
insulin
requirements
We
compared
the
groups
for
ethnic
distributions
and
clinical
features
Of
141
patients
55
(39%)
who
presented
with
DKA
had
type
2
diabetes
while
75
(53%)
had
type
1
diabetes
and
11
(8%)
could
not
be
"typed"
Hispanics
mainly
had
type
2
and
whites
predominantly
had
type
1
while
African
Americans
had
a
slight
preponderance
of
type
1
diabetes
(P=001)
Type
1
patients
were
mainly
lean
while
the
body
mass
indexes
(BMIs)
(calculated
as
the
weight
in
kilograms
divided
by
the
square
of
height
in
meters)
of
type
2
patients
were
bimodally
distributed
(33%
with
BMI<25
and
51%
with
BMI>30
P<001)
Age
of
onset
of
diabetes
was
predominantly
younger
than
40
years
in
the
type
1
group
but
was
more
broadly
distributed
in
the
type
2
group
(P<001)
Ninety-three
percent
of
the
new-onset
patients
who
were
reassessed
had
type
2
diabetes
Half
of
the
type
2
patients
had
no
identifiable
stress
factor
associated
with
the
episode
of
DKA
A
high
proportion
of
DKA
in
nonwhite
adults
occurs
in
persons
with
type
2
diabetes
especially
in
those
with
previously
undiagnosed
diabetes
The
frequency
and
clinical
heterogeneity
of
this
syndrome
in
a
multiethnic
population
have
significant
implications
for
the
diagnosis
classification
and
management
of
adults
with
diabetes
