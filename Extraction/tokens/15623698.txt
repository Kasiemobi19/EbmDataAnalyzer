Benefits
of
cognitive-motor
intervention
in
MCI
and
mild
to
moderate
Alzheimer
disease
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
a
cognitive-motor
program
in
patients
with
early
Alzheimer
disease
(AD)
who
are
treated
with
a
cholinesterase
inhibitor
(ChEI)
Patients
with
mild
cognitive
impairment
(MCI)
(12)
mild
AD
(48)
and
moderate
AD
(24)
(Global
Deterioration
Scale
stages
3
4
and
5)
were
randomized
to
receive
psychosocial
support
plus
cognitive-motor
intervention
(experimental
group)
or
psychosocial
support
alone
(control
group)
Cognitive-motor
intervention
(CMI)
consisted
of
a
1-year
structured
program
of
103
sessions
of
cognitive
exercises
plus
social
and
psychomotor
activities
The
primary
efficacy
measure
was
the
cognitive
subscale
of
the
AD
Assessment
Scale
(ADAS-cog)
Secondary
efficacy
measures
were
the
Mini-Mental
State
Examination
the
Functional
Activities
Questionnaire
and
the
Geriatric
Depression
Scale
Evaluations
were
conducted
at
1
3
6
and
12
months
by
blinded
evaluators
Patients
in
the
CMI
group
maintained
cognitive
status
at
month
6
whereas
patients
in
the
control
group
had
significantly
declined
at
that
time
Cognitive
response
was
higher
in
the
patients
with
fewer
years
of
formal
education
In
addition
more
patients
in
the
experimental
group
maintained
or
improved
their
affective
status
at
month
12
(experimental
group
75%
control
group
47%
p
=
0017)
A
long-term
CMI
in
ChEI-treated
early
Alzheimer
disease
patients
produced
additional
mood
and
cognitive
benefits
