Beneficial
effects

associated

moderate
calorie/carbohydrate
restriction

on

a

Abstract
Text
Insulin
resistance
(IR)
has
been
increasingly
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
gout
The
lipoprotein
abnormalities
described
in
hyperuricaemic
subjects
are
similar
to
those
associated
with
IR
and
insulin
influences
renal
urate
excretion
In
this
study
it
was
investigated
whether
dietary
measures
reported
to
be
beneficial
in
IR
have
serum
uric
acid
(SU)
and
lipid
lowering
effects
in
gout
Thirteen
non-diabetic
men
(median
age
50
range
38-62)
were
enrolled
Each
patient
had
had
at
least
two
gouty
attacks
during
the
four
months
before
enrollment
Dietary
recommendations
consisted
of
calorie
restriction
to
6690
kJ
(1600
kcal)
a
day
with
40%
derived
from
carbohydrate
30%
from
protein
and
30%
from
fat
replacement
of
refined
carbohydrates
with
complex
ones
and
saturated
fats
with
mono-
and
polyunsaturated
ones
At
onset
and
after
16
weeks
fasting
blood
samples
were
taken
for
determination
of
SU
serum
cholesterol
(C)
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C)
high
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
and
triglycerides
(TGs)
Results
were
expressed
as
median
(SD)
At
onset
the
body
mass
index
(BMI)
was
305
(81)
kg/m(2)
Dietary
measures
resulted
in
weight
loss
of
77
(54)
kg
(p=0002)
and
a
decrease
in
the
frequency
of
monthly
attacks
from
21
(08)
to
06
(07)
(p=0002)
The
SU
decreased
from
057
(010)
to
047
(009)
mmol/l
(p=0001)
and
normalised
in
7
(58%)
of
the
12
patients
with
an
initially
raised
level
Serum
cholesterol
decreased
from
60
(17)
to
47
(0
9)
mmol/l
(p=0002)
LDL-C
from
35
(12)
to
27
(08)
mmol/l
(p=0
004)
TGs
from
47
(42)
to
19
(10)
mmol/l
(p=0001)
and
CHDL-C
ratios
from
67
(17)
to
52
(10)
(p=0002)
HDL-C
levels
increased
insignificantly
High
baseline
SU
frequency
of
attacks
total
cholesterol
LDL-C
and
TG
levels
and
total
CHDL-C
ratios
correlated
with
higher
decreases
in
the
respective
variables
upon
dietary
intervention
(p<005)
The
results
suggest
that
weight
reduction
associated
with
a
change
in
proportional
macronutrient
intake
as
recently
recommended
in
IR
is
beneficial
reducing
the
SU
levels
and
dyslipidaemia
in
gout
Current
dietary
recommendations
for
gout
may
need
re-evaluation
