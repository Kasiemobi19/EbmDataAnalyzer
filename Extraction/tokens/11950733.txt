Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
uptake
and
outcome
of
expectant
management
of
spontaneous
first
trimester
miscarriage
in
an
early
pregnancy
assessment
unit
1096
consecutive
patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
spontaneous
first
trimester
miscarriage
Each
miscarriage
was
classified
as
complete
incomplete
missed
or
anembryonic
on
the
basis
of
ultrasonography
Women
who
needed
treatment
were
given
the
choice
of
expectant
management
or
surgical
evacuation
of
retained
products
of
conception
under
general
anaesthesia
Women
undergoing
expectant
management
were
checked
a
few
days
after
transvaginal
bleeding
had
stopped
or
they
were
monitored
at
weekly
intervals
for
four
weeks
A
complete
miscarriage
(absence
of
transvaginal
bleeding
and
endometrial
thickness
<15
mm)
the
number
of
women
completing
their
miscarriage
within
each
week
of
management
and
complications
(excessive
pain
or
transvaginal
bleeding
necessitating
hospital
admission
or
clinical
evidence
of
infection)
Two
patients
with
molar
pregnancies
were
excluded
and
37%
of
the
remainder
(408/1094)
were
classified
as
having
had
a
complete
miscarriage
70%
(478/686)
of
women
with
retained
products
of
conception
chose
expectant
management
of
these
27
(6%)
were
lost
to
follow
up
A
successful
outcome
without
surgical
intervention
was
seen
in
81%
of
cases
(367/451)
The
rate
of
spontaneous
completion
was
91%
(201/221)
for
those
cases
classified
as
incomplete
miscarriage
76%
(105/138)
for
missed
miscarriage
and
66%
(61/92)
for
anembryonic
pregnancy
70%
of
women
completed
their
miscarriage
within
14
days
of
classification
(84%
for
incomplete
miscarriage
and
52%
for
missed
miscarriage
and
anembryonic
pregnancy)
Most
women
with
retained
products
of
conception
chose
expectant
management
Ultrasonography
can
be
used
to
advise
patients
on
the
likelihood
that
their
miscarriage
will
complete
spontaneously
within
a
given
time
