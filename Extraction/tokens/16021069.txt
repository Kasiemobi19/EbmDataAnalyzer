Comparison

for
the
management
of
gestational
diabetes
in
a
large

organization
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
undertaken
to
compare
the
use
of
glyburide
with
insulin
for
the
treatment
of
gestational
diabetes
mellitus
(GDM)
unresponsive
to
diet
therapy
A
retrospective
study
was
performed
among
women
with
singleton
pregnancies
who
had
GDM
diagnosed
with
fasting
plasma
glucose
140
mg/dL
or
less
on
glucose
tolerance
testing
between
12
and
34
weeks
who
failed
diet
therapy
from
1999
to
2002
We
identified
584
women
and
compared
those
treated
with
insulin
between
1999
and
2000
with
women
treated
with
glyburide
between
2001
and
2002
Maternal
and
neonatal
outcomes
and
complications
were
assessed
Statistical
methods
included
univariate
analyses
and
multivariable
logistic
regression
In
1999
through
2000
268
women
had
GDM
diagnosed
and
were
treated
with
insulin
in
2001
through
2002
316
women
had
GDM
diagnosed
of
which
236
(75%)
received
glyburide
The
2
groups
were
similar
with
regard
to
age
nulliparity
and
historical
GDM
risk
factors
however
women
in
the
insulin
group
had
a
higher
mean
body
mass
index
(319
vs
306
kg/m
2

P=04)
a
greater
proportion
identified
themselves
as
white
(43%
28%
P<001)
and
fewer
as
Asian
(24%
37%
P=001)
and
they
had
a
significantly
higher
mean
fasting
on
glucose
tolerance
test
(1054
vs
1024
mg/dL

P=005)
compared
with
the
glyburide
group
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
birth
weight
(3599+/-650
g
vs
3661+/-629
g
P=3)
macrosomia
(24%
25%
P=7)
or
cesarean
delivery
(35%
39
%
P=4)
Women
in
the
glyburide
group
had
a
higher
incidence
of
preeclampsia
(12%
6%
P=02)
and
neonates
in
the
glyburide
group
were
more
likely
to
receive
phototherapy
(9%
5%
P<05)
and
less
likely
to
be
admitted
to
the
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
(NICU)
(15%
24%
P=008)
though
they
had
a
longer
NICU
length
of
stay
(43+/-96
vs
80+/-101
P=002)
Posttreatment
glycemic
control
data
were
available
for
122
women
treated
with
insulin
and
137
women
treated
with
glyburide
More
women
in
the
glyburide
group
achieved
mean
fasting
and
postprandial
goals
(86%
63%
P<001)
These
findings
remained
significant
in
logistic
regression
analysis
In
a
large
managed
care
organization
glyburide
was
at
least
as
effective
as
insulin
in
achieving
glycemic
control
and
similar
birth
weights
in
women
with
GDM
who
failed
diet
therapy
The
increased
risk
of
preeclampsia
and
phototherapy
in
the
glyburide
group
warrant
further
study
