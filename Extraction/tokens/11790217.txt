Oral
antihyperglycemic
therapy
for
type

diabetes
clinical
applications
Abstract
Text
Oral
agents
are
the
mainstay
of
pharmacologic
treatment
for
type
2
diabetes
and
physicians
now
have
a
number
of
agents
to
choose
from
However
more
choices
translate
into
more
complex
decision
making
Many
patients
with
diabetes
have
associated
comorbidities
and
most
diabetic
patients
will
require
more
than
1
agent
to
achieve
good
glycemic
control
This
article
illustrates
several
of
the
pharmacologic
approaches
to
type
2
diabetes
through
4
situations
that
use
principles
of
evidence-based
medicine
The
scenarios
also
highlight
some
of
the
difficulties
in
choosing
the
optimal
pharmacologic
treatment
regimen
for
individual
patients
Physicians
should
also
recognize
that
type
2
diabetes
is
a
multisystem
disorder
that
requires
multidisciplinary
care
including
education
and
ongoing
counseling
for
effective
patient
self-management
of
the
disease
Finally
patient
preferences
are
a
vital
component
of
informed
decision
making
for
pharmacologic
treatment
of
diabetes
