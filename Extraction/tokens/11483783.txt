The
role
of
antibiotics
in
treatment
of
uncomplicated
acute
otitis
media
Abstract
Text
In
1995
>5
million
episodes
of
acute
otitis
media
(AOM)
accounted
for
$3
billion
in
health
care
expenditures
To
synthesize
the
literature
on
the
natural
history
of
AOM
the
effectiveness
of
antibiotic
treatment
in
uncomplicated
AOM
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
specific
antibiotic
regimens
Seven
electronic
databases
for
articles
published
between
1966
and
March
1999
and
reference
lists
in
proceedings
published
articles
reports
and
guidelines
Two
physicians
independently
assessed
each
article
Studies
addressing
AOM
in
children
4
weeks
to
18
years
old
were
included
those
addressing
children
with
immunodeficiencies
or
craniofacial
abnormalities
were
excluded
Randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
were
used
to
assess
antibiotic
effectiveness
and
RCTs
and
cohort
studies
were
used
to
assess
the
natural
history
of
AOM
Among
the
3491
citations
identified
80
(23%)
met
our
inclusion
criteria
Two
physicians
independently
abstracted
data
and
assessed
the
quality
of
studies
using
a
validated
scale
for
RCTs
and
8
quality
components
for
cohort
studies
Random-effects
estimates
of
pooled
absolute
rate
differences
of
outcomes
were
derived
and
heterogeneity
of
both
the
rates
and
rate
differences
was
assessed
Children
with
AOM
not
treated
with
antibiotics
experienced
a
1-
to
7-day
clinical
failure
rate
of
19%
(95%
confidence
interval
010-028)
and
few
suppurative
complications
When
patients
were
treated
with
amoxicillin
the
2-
to
7-day
clinical
failure
rate
was
reduced
to
7%
a
12%
(95%
confidence
interval
004-020)
reduction
Adverse
effects
primarily
gastrointestinal
were
more
common
among
children
on
cefixime
than
among
those
on
ampicillin
or
amoxicillin
They
were
also
more
common
among
children
on
amoxicillin-clavulanate
than
among
those
on
azithromycin
The
majority
of
uncomplicated
cases
of
AOM
resolve
spontaneously
without
apparent
suppurative
complications
Ampicillin
or
amoxicillin
confers
a
limited
therapeutic
benefit
There
is
no
evidence
to
support
any
particular
antibiotic
regimens
as
more
effective
at
relieving
symptoms
Certain
antibiotics
are
more
likely
than
others
to
cause
diarrhea
and
other
adverse
events
