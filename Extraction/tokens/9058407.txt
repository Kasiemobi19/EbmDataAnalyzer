Migraine
and
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
Migraine
and
tension-type
headache
are
primary
headache
disorders
that
occur
during
pregnancy
Migraine
sometimes
occurs
for
the
first
time
with
pregnancy
Most
migraineurs
improve
while
pregnant
however
migraine
often
recurs
postpartum
Some
disorders
that
produce
headache
such
as
stroke
cerebral
venous
thrombosis
eclampsia
and
SAH
occur
more
frequently
during
pregnancy
Diagnostic
testing
serves
to
exclude
organic
causes
of
headache
to
confirm
the
diagnosis
and
to
establish
a
baseline
before
treatment
If
neurodiagnostic
testing
is
indicated
the
study
that
provides
the
most
information
with
the
least
fetal
risk
is
the
study
of
choice
Although
drugs
are
used
commonly
during
pregnancy
there
is
insufficient
knowledge
about
their
effects
on
the
growing
fetus
Most
drugs
are
not
teratogenic
Adverse
effects
such
as
spontaneous
abortion
development
defects
and
various
postnatal
effects
depend
on
the
dose
and
route
of
administration
and
the
timing
of
the
exposure
relative
to
the
period
of
fetal
development
Although
medication
use
should
be
limited
it
is
not
absolutely
contraindicated
in
pregnancy
In
migraine
the
risk
of
status
migrainosus
may
be
greater
than
the
potential
risk
of
the
medication
use
to
treat
the
pregnant
patient
Nonpharmacologic
treatment
is
the
ideal
solution
however
analgesics
such
as
acetaminophen
and
narcotics
can
be
used
on
a
limited
basis
Preventive
therapy
is
a
last
resort
