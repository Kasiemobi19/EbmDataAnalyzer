To
assess
the
effectiveness
of
different
colorectal
cancer
screening
tests
for
adults
at
average
risk
Recent
systematic
reviews
Guide
to
Clinical
Preventive
Services
2nd
edition
and
focused
searches
of
MEDLINE
from
1966
through
September
2001
The
authors
also
conducted
hand
searches
reviewed
bibliographies
and
consulted
context
experts
to
ensure
completeness
When
available
the
most
recent
high-quality
systematic
review
was
used
to
identify
relevant
articles
This
review
was
then
supplemented
with
a
MEDLINE
search
for
more
recent
articles
One
reviewer
abstracted
information
from
the
final
set
of
studies
into
evidence
tables
and
a
second
reviewer
checked
the
tables
for
accuracy
Discrepancies
were
resolved
by
consensus
For
average-risk
adults
older
than
50
years
of
age
evidence
from
multiple
well-conducted
randomized
trials
supported
the
effectiveness
of
fecal
occult
blood
testing
in
reducing
colorectal
cancer
incidence
and
mortality
rates
compared
with
no
screening
Data
from
well-conducted
case-control
studies
supported
the
effectiveness
of
sigmoidoscopy
and
possibly
colonoscopy
in
reducing
colon
cancer
incidence
and
mortality
rates
A
nonrandomized
controlled
trial
examining
colorectal
cancer
mortality
rates
and
randomized
trials
examining
diagnostic
yield
supported
the
use
of
fecal
occult
blood
testing
plus
sigmoidoscopy
The
effectiveness
of
barium
enema
is
unclear
Data
are
insufficient
to
support
a
definitive
determination
of
the
most
effective
screening
strategy
Colorectal
cancer
screening
reduces
death
from
colorectal
cancer
and
can
decrease
the
incidence
of
disease
through
removal
of
adenomatous
polyps
Several
available
screening
options
seem
to
be
effective
but
the
single
best
screening
approach
cannot
be
determined
because
data
are
insufficient
