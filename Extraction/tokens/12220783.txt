Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
contraceptive
efficacy
cycle
control
tolerability
and
user
acceptability
of
a
novel
combined
contraceptive
vaginal
ring
for
up
to
13
cycles
Healthy
women
requesting
contraception
were
enrolled
in
this
1-year
multicenter
study
Each
ring
released
120
microg
of
etonogestrel
and
15
microg
of
ethinylestradiol
daily
and
was
used
for
3
weeks
followed
by
a
1-week
ring-free
period
A
total
of
2322
women
started
treatment
and
so
formed
the
intent-to-treat
population
Subjects
were
followed
for
23298
cycles
equivalent
to
1786
woman-years
Compliance
was
good
with
856%
of
cycles
in
full
compliance
with
specified
criteria
In
the
intent-to-treat
population
21
pregnancies
occurred
giving
a
Pearl
Index
of
118
(95%
confidence
interval
073
180)
Eleven
of
the
pregnancies
were
attributable
to
noncompliance
the
Pearl
Index
for
the
per-protocol
population
was
077
(95%
confidence
interval
037
140)
The
mean
incidence
of
withdrawal
bleeding
was
985%
in
all
cycles
Irregular
bleeding
occurred
in
55%
of
all
cycles
and
in
most
women
early
or
late
withdrawal
bleeding
was
restricted
to
spotting
The
ring
was
well
tolerated
with
a
low
incidence
of
adverse
events
only
25%
of
all
discontinuations
were
device
related
The
ring
was
easy
to
insert
and
remove
and
did
not
interfere
with
intercourse
Eighty-five
percent
of
women
were
satisfied
with
the
ring
and
90%
would
recommend
its
use
to
others
The
ring
is
an
effective
contraceptive
with
excellent
cycle
control
that
is
convenient
well
tolerated
and
highly
acceptable
to
users
