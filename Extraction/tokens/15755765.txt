Intensive
lipid
lowering
with
atorvastatin
in
patients
with
stable
coronary
disease
Abstract
Text
Previous
trials
have
demonstrated
that
lowering
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
levels
below
currently
recommended
levels
is
beneficial
in
patients
with
acute
coronary
syndromes
We
prospectively
assessed
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
lowering
LDL
cholesterol
levels
below
100
mg
per
deciliter
(26
mmol
per
liter)
in
patients
with
stable
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
A
total
of
10001
patients
with
clinically
evident
CHD
and
LDL
cholesterol
levels
of
less
than
130
mg
per
deciliter
(34
mmol
per
liter)
were
randomly
assigned
to
double-blind
therapy
and
received
either
10
mg
or
80
mg
of
atorvastatin
per
day
Patients
were
followed
for
a
median
of
49
years
The
primary
end
point
was
the
occurrence
of
a
first
major
cardiovascular
event
defined
as
death
from
CHD
nonfatal
non-procedure-related
myocardial
infarction
resuscitation
after
cardiac
arrest
or
fatal
or
nonfatal
stroke
The
mean
LDL
cholesterol
levels
were
77
mg
per
deciliter
(20
mmol
per
liter)
during
treatment
with
80
mg
of
atorvastatin
and
101
mg
per
deciliter
(26
mmol
per
liter)
during
treatment
with
10
mg
of
atorvastatin
The
incidence
of
persistent
elevations
in
liver
aminotransferase
levels
was
02
percent
in
the
group
given
10
mg
of
atorvastatin
and
12
percent
in
the
group
given
80
mg
of
atorvastatin
(P<0001)
A
primary
event
occurred
in
434
patients
(87
percent)
receiving
80
mg
of
atorvastatin
as
compared
with
548
patients
(109
percent)
receiving
10
mg
of
atorvastatin
representing
an
absolute
reduction
in
the
rate
of
major
cardiovascular
events
of
22
percent
and
a
22
percent
relative
reduction
in
risk
(hazard
ratio
078
95
percent
confidence
interval
069
to
089
P<0001)
There
was
no
difference
between
the
two
treatment
groups
in
overall
mortality
Intensive
lipid-lowering
therapy
with
80
mg
of
atorvastatin
per
day
in
patients
with
stable
CHD
provides
significant
clinical
benefit
beyond
that
afforded
by
treatment
with
10
mg
of
atorvastatin
per
day
This
occurred
with
a
greater
incidence
of
elevated
aminotransferase
levels
