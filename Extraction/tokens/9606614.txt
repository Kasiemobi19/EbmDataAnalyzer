Optimal
treatment
of
phantom
limb
pain
in
the
elderly
Abstract
Text
Phantom
limb
and
stump
pain
is
a
common
sequela
of
amputation
In
geriatric
patients
with
an
amputated
limb
and
multiple
other
illnesses
drug
therapy
may
be
problematic
and
invasive
techniques
may
be
risky
Interactions
between
pathophysiological
mechanisms
in
the
peripheral
and
central
nervous
systems
may
be
responsible
for
the
initiation
and
maintenance
of
chronic
phantom
limb
and
stump
pain
These
mechanisms
include
(i)
peripheral
damage
to
nociceptive
fibres
and
dorsal
root
ganglion
cells
which
acquire
abnormal
sensitivity
to
mechanical
thermal
and
chemical
stimuli
(ii)
the
prolonged
sensitisation
of
central
nociceptive
'second
order'
neurons
in
the
dorsal
horn
of
the
spinal
cord
which
become
hyperexcitable
and
start
responding
to
nonnoxious
stimuli
and
(iii)
the
degeneration
of
nociceptive
neurons
which
may
trigger
the
anatomical
sprouting
of
low
threshold
mechanosensitive
terminals
to
form
connections
with
central
nociceptive
neurons
This
may
subsequently
induce
functional
synaptic
reorganisation
in
the
dorsal
horn
The
provision
of
a
pain-free
perioperative
interval
using
regional
anaesthetic
techniques
is
likely
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
phantom
limb
pain
The
therapy
of
manifest
pain
is
difficult
and
treatment
should
start
as
soon
as
possible
to
prevent
chronic
pain
In
the
acute
state
the
infusion
of
calcitonin
and
oral
opioid
analgesics
have
proven
to
be
helpful
while
established
phantom
limb
pain
may
respond
to
antidepressants
anticonvulsants
and
drugs
that
mimic
or
enhance
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
function
Pharmacological
treatment
should
be
combined
with
transcutaneous
electrical
nerve
stimulation
sympathetic
blockade
and
psychotherapy
In
addition
new
therapeutic
strategies
are
now
being
tested
examples
include
capsaicin
new
anticonvulsants
and
N-methyl-D-aspartate
antagonists
Patients
with
severe
pain
should
be
referred
to
a
pain
specialist
to
ensure
optimal
and
timely
interventional
pain
management
