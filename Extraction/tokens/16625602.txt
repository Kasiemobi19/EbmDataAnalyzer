Title
Antibiotics
for
exacerbations
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
Abstract
Text
Most
patients
with
an
exacerbation
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD)
are
treated
with
antibiotics
However
the
value
of
their
use
remains
uncertain
Some
controlled
trials
of
antibiotics
have
shown
benefit
(Berry
1960
Pines
1972)
while
others
have
not
(Elmes
1965b
Nicotra
1982)
To
conduct
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
estimating
the
value
of
antibiotics
in
the
management
of
acute
COPD
exacerbations
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue

2005)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
December
2005)
EMBASE
(1974
to
December
2005)
Web

Science
(December

and
other
electronically
available
databases
Randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
in
patients
with
acute
COPD
exacerbations
comparing
antibiotic
(for
a
minimum
of
five
days)
and
placebo
Data
were
analysed
using
Review
Manager
software
Continuous
data
were
analysed
using
weighted
mean
differences
(WMD)
and
95%
confidence
intervals
(CI)
Relative
risks
(RR)
(and
95%
CI)
were
calculated
for
all
dichotomous
data
Where
appropriate
number
needed
to
treat
to
benefit
(NNT)
and
95%
CI
were
calculated
Eleven
trials
with
917
patients
were
included
Ten
trials
used
increased
cough
sputum
volume
and
purulence
diagnostic
criteria
for
COPD
exacerbation
Eight-hundred
and
fifty-seven
patients
provided
data
for
outcomes
including
mortality

volume
sputum
purulence

peak

and

Antibiotic
therapy
regardless
of
antibiotic
choice
significantly
reduced
mortality
(RR

010
to
052
with
NNT

and

95%
CI
041
to

with
NNT
of

95%

to

There
was
a
small
increase
in
risk
of
diarrhoea
with
antibiotics
(RR
286
95%
CI
106
to
776)
Antibiotics
did
not
improve
arterial
blood
gases
and
peak
flow
This
review
shows
that
in
COPD
exacerbations
with
increased
cough
and
sputum
purulence
antibiotics
regardless
of
choice
reduce
the
risk
of
short-term
mortality
by
77%
decrease
the
risk
of
treatment
failure
by
53%
and
the
risk
of
sputum
purulence
by
44%
with
a
small
increase
in
the
risk
of
diarrhoea
These
results
should
be
interpreted
with
caution
due
to
the
differences
in
patient
selection
antibiotic
choice
small
number
of
included
trials
and
lack
of
control
for
interventions
that
influence
outcome
such
as
use
of
systemic
corticosteroids
and
ventilatory
support
Nevertheless
this
review
supports
antibiotics
for
patients
with
COPD
exacerbations
with
increased
cough
and
sputum
purulence
who
are
moderately
or
severely
ill
