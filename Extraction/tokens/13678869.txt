Effects
of
candesartan
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure

left-ventricular
systolic
function
taking
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitors
the
CHARM-Added
trial
Abstract
Text
Angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
blockers
have
favourable
effects
on
haemodynamic
measurements
neurohumoral
activity
and
left-ventricular
remodelling
when
added
to
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
(CHF)
We
aimed
to
find
out
whether
these
drugs
improve
clinical
outcome
Between
March
1999
and
November
1999
we
enrolled
2548
patients
with
New
York
Heart
Association
functional
class
II-IV
CHF
and
left-ventricular
ejection
fraction
40%
or
lower
and
who
were
being
treated
with
ACE
inhibitors
We
randomly
assigned
patients
candesartan
(n=1276
target
dose
32
mg
once
daily)
or
placebo
(n=1272)
At
baseline
55%
of
patients
were
also
treated
with
beta
blockers
and
17%
with
spironolactone
The
primary
outcome
of
the
study
was
the
composite
of
cardiovascular
death
or
hospital
admission
for
CHF
Analysis
was
done
by
intention
to
treat
The
median
follow-up
was
41
months
483
(38%)
patients
in
the
candesartan
group
and
538
(42%)
in
the
placebo
group
experienced
the
primary
outcome
(unadjusted
hazard
ratio
085
[95%
CI
075-096]
p=0011
covariate
adjusted
p=0010)
Candesartan
reduced
each
of
the
components
of
the
primary
outcome
significantly
as
well
as
the
total
number
of
hospital
admissions
for
CHF
The
benefits
of
candesartan
were
similar
in
all
predefined
subgroups
including
patients
receiving
baseline
beta
blocker
treatment
The
addition
of
candesartan
to
ACE
inhibitor
and
other
treatment
leads
to
a
further
clinically
important
reduction
in
relevant
cardiovascular
events
in
patients
with
CHF
and
reduced
left-ventricular
ejection
fraction
