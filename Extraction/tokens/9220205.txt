Androgen
and

hormone
replacement
therapy

Abstract
Text
The
endocrine
physiology
of
the
climacteric
supports
a
rationale
for
the
concomitant
replacement
of
androgen
and
estrogen
following
menopause
Clinical
and
research
experience
with
estrogen-androgen
hormone
replacement
therapy
as
well
as
androgen-only
therapy
suggests
that
the
health
benefit
offered
by
androgen
replacement
exceeds
the
potential
risk
when
treatment
is
properly
managed
In
this
review
we
concentrate
on
the
effects
of
oral
alkylated
androgens
The
virilizing
effects
(eg
hirsutism
acne
voice
change
and
alopecia)
of
oral
androgens
are
typically
dose
and
duration
dependent
androgen
replacement
at
doses
<
or
=
10
mg
once
daily
administered
for
prolonged
periods
(>
6
months)
produces
masculinization
effects
that
generally
abate
with
dose
reduction
or
discontinuation
of
treatment
No
clinical
sequelae
or
irreversible
pathophysiologic
effects
have
been
associated
with
any
virilization
that
may
occur
Changes
in
lipoprotein
metabolism
associated
with
oral
estrogen-androgen
use
include
reduced
total
cholesterol
levels
and
reduced
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
which
may
reduce
the
long-term
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
No
clinically
identifiable
risk
with
respect
to
other
cardiovascular
variables
such
as
blood
pressure
has
been
associated
with
the
longterm
administration
of
low
doses
of
oral
androgen
With
regard
to
liver
toxicity
reports
of
jaundice
peliosis
hepatis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
are
extremely
rare
at
the
dose
levels
of
androgen
used
in
hormone
replacement
therapy
although
individual
sensitivity
to
the
potential
hepatotoxic
effects
of
oral
alkylated
and
nonalkylated
androgen
may
vary
considerably
Daily
dosing
with
oral
alkylated
androgen
in
combination
with
estrogen
is
well
tolerated
Retrospective
and
prospective
studies
involving
the
use
of
androgens
alone
and
in
combination
with
estrogens
demonstrate
that
concerns
about
the
adverse
effects
of
androgen
use
associated
with
supraphysiologic
self-escalated
doses
in
men
do
not
apply
to
the
much
lower
doses
combined
with
estrogens
for
hormone
replacement
in
postmenopausal
women
