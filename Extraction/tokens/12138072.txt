Title
Use
of
tonsil
size
in
the
evaluation
of
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
Abstract
Text
(1)
To
determine
the
extent
to
which
tonsil
size
contributes
to
the
severity
of
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
(OSA)
in
children
and
(2)
to
assess
the
use
of
tonsillar-pharyngeal
(TP)
ratio
in
differentiating
patients
with
different
severity
of
OSA
Lateral
neck
radiograph
was
performed
on
35
children
referred
consecutively
to
a
university
paediatric
chest
clinic
for
suspected
OSA
secondary
to
tonsillar
hypertrophy
The
tonsil
size
was
determined
by
measuring
the
TP
ratio
on
the
radiographs
The
severity
of
OSA
was
assessed
by
overnight
polysomnography
A
total
of
24
boys
and
11
girls
(median
age
62
years)
were
studied
All
presented
with
symptoms
of
OSA
and
tonsillar
hypertrophy
was
detected
on
clinical
examination
The
median
apnoea-hypopnoea
index
(AHI)
was
1693
(interquartile
range
841
to
2829)
The
median
TP
ratio
was
076
(interquartile
range
065
to
080)
AHI
was
positively
correlated
with
the
TP
ratio
The
clinical
tonsil
size
did
not
correlate
with
the
AHI
or
the
TP
ratio
Using
a
TP
ratio
of
0479
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
predicting
cases
with
moderate/severe
OSA
(AHI
>10)
were
958%
and
818%
respectively
while
the
positive
and
negative
predictive
values
were
920%
and
900%
respectively
Results
show
that
in
a
population
of
children
with
OSA
tonsillar
hypertrophy
as
assessed
by
lateral
neck
radiograph
correlates
positively
with
the
severity
of
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
The
TP
ratio
has
high
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
predicting
those
with
moderate/severe
disease
and
this
feature
may
be
used
as
a
clinical
screening
method
in
prioritising
patients
with
OSA
for
further
assessment
