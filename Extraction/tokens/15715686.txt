Holotranscobalamin--a
first
choice
assay
for
diagnosing
early
vitamin
B
deficiency
Abstract
Text
The
performance
of
holotranscobalamin
(holoTC)
was
compared
with
the
other
markers
of
vitamin
B12
deficiency
and
the
influence
of
age
renal
function
and
thyroid
status
was
examined
We
examined
937
individuals
not
treated
with
vitamin
B12
but
in
whom
vitamin
B12
deficiency
was
suspected
because
of
a
plasma
methylmalonic
acid
(MMA)
above
028
micromol
L(-1)
within
the
past
4
years
Besides
laboratory
tests
a
structured
interview
and
a
neurological
examination
were
performed
amongst
534
individuals
Amongst
these
140
individuals
qualified
for
a
randomized
trial
(MMA
040-200
micromol
L(-1))
They
were
randomized
to
injections
with
vitamin
B12
or
placebo
and
re-examined
after
3
months
One
university
hospital
in
Aarhus
Denmark
The
ROC
curves
indicate
that
holoTC
(AUC
090)
compared
favourable
with
plasma
vitamin
B12
(AUC
085)
for
identifying
individuals
likely
to
have
vitamin
B12
deficiency
(MMA
>
or
=075
micromol
L(-1)
and
plasma
total
homocysteine
(tHcy)
>
or
=15
micromol
L(-1))
and
further
that
holoTC
(AUC
091)
might
replace
combined
testing
with
plasma
vitamin
B12
and
the
metabolites
No
association
was
observed
between
the
biochemical
markers
and
symptoms
and
signs
possibly
related
to
vitamin
B12
deficiency
HoloTC
TC
saturation
plasma
vitamin
B12
MMA
and
tHcy
were
significantly
associated
with
plasma
creatinine
(all
with
P
<0001)
Only
tHcy
was
significantly
associated
with
thyroid
stimulating
hormone
(P=002)
HoloTC
shows
promise
as
first-line
tests
for
diagnosing
early
vitamin
B12
deficiency
