Text
To
assess
the
diagnostic
values
of
single
and
combined
data
from
the
history
physical
examination
and
medical
record
with
regard
to
peripheral
arterial
occlusive
disease
(PAOD)
in
patients
with
leg
complaints
to
construct
a
multivariable
model
for
the
clinical
diagnosis
of
PAOD
by
primary
care
physicians

The

indicated

(p

Palpation
of
both
foot
pulses
is
the
key
procedure
for
the
clinical
diagnosis
of
PAOD
Traditional
clinical
evaluation
enables
the
general
practitioner
to
exclude
the
diagnosis
of
PAOD
in
many
individuals
with
a
high
degree
of
certainly
to
establish
the
diagnosis
in
a
small
group
of
patients
and
to
define
a
limited
group
of
patients
where
supplementary
noninvasive
testing
is
appropriate
The
MLR
model
can
be
used
as
a
diagnostic
checklist
and
as
a
reference
for
the
physician's
clinical
hypothesis
