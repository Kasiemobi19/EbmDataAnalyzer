Abstract
Text
Two
randomized
double-blind
vehicle-controlled
multicenter
studies
assessed
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
a
new
terbinafine
1%
solution
for
the
treatment
of
interdigital
tinea
pedis
and
tinea
corporis
or
tinea
cruris
(tinea
corporis/cruris)
Patients
with
interdigital
tinea
pedis
applied
terbinafine
1%
solution
or
vehicle
twice
daily
for
1
week
with
7
weeks
of
follow-up
(N
=
153)
and
patients
with
tinea
corporis/cruris
applied
terbinafine
1%
solution
or
vehicle
once
daily
for
1
week
with
3
weeks
of
follow-up
(N
=
66)
Efficacy
was
assessed
mycologically
and
clinically
at
the
end
of
treatment
and
throughout
follow-up
In
the
tinea
pedis
study
66%
of
patients
were
effectively
treated
with
terbinafine
compared
with
4%
of
the
group
treated
by
vehicle
(P
<
001
Mantel-Haenszel
test)
In
the
tinea
corporis/cruris
study
treatment
was
effective
in
65%
of
the
terbinafine
group
compared
with
8%
of
the
vehicle
group
(P
<
001)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
frequency
of
cutaneous
adverse
events
between
the
2
groups
in
either
study
We
conclude
that
one
week
of
therapy
with
terbinafine
1%
solution
is
highly
effective
superior
to
vehicle
and
safe
for
use
in
superficial
fungal
infections
