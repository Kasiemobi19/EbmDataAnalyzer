Relationship
between
antidepressant
medication
treatment
and
suicide
in
adolescents
Abstract
Text
A
decade
of
increasing
antidepressant
medication
treatment
for
adolescents
and
corresponding
declines
in
suicide
rates
raise
the
possibility
that
antidepressants
have
helped
prevent
youth
suicide
To
evaluate
the
relationship
between
regional
changes
in
antidepressant
medication
treatment
and
suicide
in
adolescents
from
1990
to
2000
Analysis
of
prescription
data
from
the
nation's
largest
pharmacy
benefit
management
organization
national
suicide
mortality
files
regional
sociodemographic
data
from
the
1990
and
2000
US
Census
and
regional
data
on
physicians
per
capita
Youth
aged
10
to
19
years
who
filled
a
prescription
for
antidepressant
medication
and
same-aged
completed
suicides
from
588
three-digit
ZIP
code
regions
in
the
United
States
The
relationship
between
regional
change
in
antidepressant
medication
treatment
and
suicide
rate
stratified
by
sex
age
group
regional
median
income
and
regional
racial
composition
There
was
a
significant
adjusted
negative
relationship
between
regional
change
in
antidepressant
medication
treatment
and
suicide
during
the
study
period
A
1%
increase
in
adolescent
use
of
antidepressants
was
associated
with
a
decrease
of
023
suicide
per
100
000
adolescents
per
year
(beta
=
-023
t
=
-514
P<001)
In
stratified
adjusted
analyses
significant
inverse
relationships
were
present
among
males
(beta
=
-032
t
=
-381
P<001)
youth
aged
15
to
19
years
(beta
=
-029
t
=
-343
P<001)
and
regions
with
lower
family
median
incomes
(beta
=
-023
t
=
-373
P<001)
An
inverse
relationship
between
regional
change
in
use
of
antidepressants
and
suicide
raises
the
possibility
of
a
role
for
using
antidepressant
treatment
in
youth
suicide
prevention
efforts
especially
for
males
older
adolescents
and
adolescents
who
reside
in
lower-income
regions
