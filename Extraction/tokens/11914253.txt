Withdrawal
of

Abstract
Text
HMG-CoA
Reductase
Inhibitors
(statins)
reduce
cardiac
event
rates
in
patients
with
stable
coronary
heart
disease
Withdrawal
of
chronic
statin
treatment
during
acute
coronary
syndromes
may
impair
vascular
function
independent
of
lipid-lowering
effects
and
thus
increase
cardiac
event
rate
We
investigated
the
effects
of
statins
on
the
cardiac
event
rate
in
1616
patients
of
the
Platelet
Receptor
Inhibition
in
Ischemic
Syndrome
Management
(PRISM)
study
who
had
coronary
artery
disease
and
chest
pain
in
the
previous
24
hours
We
recorded
death
and
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
during
the
30-day
follow-up
Baseline
clinical
characteristics
did
not
differ
among
1249
patients
without
statin
therapy
379
patients
with
continued
statin
therapy
and
86
patients
with
discontinued
statin
therapy
after
hospitalization
Statin
therapy
was
associated
with
a
reduced
event
rate
at
30-day
follow-up
compared
with
patients
without
statins
(adjusted
hazard
ratio
049
[95%
CI
021
to
086]
P=0004)
If
the
statin
therapy
was
withdrawn
after
admission
cardiac
risk
increased
compared
with
patients
who
continued
to
receive
statins
(293
[95%
CI
164
to
627]
P=0005)
and
tended
to
be
higher
compared
with
patients
who
never
received
statins
(169
[95%
CI
092
to
356]
P=015)
This
was
related
to
an
increased
event
rate
during
the
first
week
after
onset
of
symptoms
and
was
independent
of
cholesterol
levels
In
a
multivariate
model
troponin
T
elevation
(P=0005)
ST
changes
(P=002)
and
continuation
of
statin
therapy
(P=0008)
were
the
only
independent
predictors
of
patient
outcome
Statin
pretreatment
in
patients
with
acute
coronary
syndromes
is
associated
with
improved
clinical
outcome
However
discontinuation
of
statins
after
onset
of
symptoms
completely
abrogates
this
beneficial
effect
