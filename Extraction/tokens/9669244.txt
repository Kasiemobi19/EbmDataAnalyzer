Abstract
Text
We
sought
to
determine
whether
the
prehospital
electrocardiogram
(ECG)
improves
the
diagnosis
of
an
acute
coronary
syndrome
The
ECG
is
the
most
widely
used
screening
test
for
evaluating
patients
with
chest
pain
Prehospital
and
in-hospital
ECGs
were
obtained
in
3027
consecutive
patients
with
symptoms
of
suspected
acute
myocardial
infarction
362
of
whom
were
randomized
to
prehospital
versus
hospital
thrombolysis
and
2665
of
whom
did
not
participate
in
the
randomized
trial
Prehospital
and
hospital
records
were
abstracted
for
clinical
characteristics
and
diagnostic
outcome
ST
segment
and
T
and
Q
wave
abnormalities
suggestive
of
myocardial
ischemia
or
infarction
were
more
common
on
both
the
prehospital
and
hospital
ECGs
of
patients
with
as
compared
with
those
without
acute
coronary
syndromes
(p
<
or
=
000001)
Those
with
prehospital
thrombolysis
were
more
likely
to
show
resolution
of
ST
segment
elevation
by
the
time
of
hospital
admission
(14%
vs
5%
in
patients
treated
in
the
hospital
p
=
0004)
In
patients
not
considered
for
prehospital
thrombolysis
both
persistent
and
transient
ST
segment
and
T
or
Q
wave
abnormalities
discriminated
those
with
from
those
without
acute
coronary
ischemia
or
infarction
Compared
with
ST
segment
elevation
on
a
single
ECG
added
consideration
of
dynamic
changes
in
ST
segment
elevation
between
serial
ECGs
improved
the
sensitivity
for
an
acute
coronary
syndrome
from
34%
to
46%
and
reduced
specificity
from
96%
to
93%
(both
p
<
000004)
Overall
compared
with
abnormalities
observed
on
a
single
ECG
consideration
of
serial
evolution
in
ST
segment
T
or
Q
wave
or
left
bundle
branch
block
(LBBB)
abnormalities
between
the
prehospital
and
initial
hospital
ECG
improved
the
diagnostic
sensitivity
for
an
acute
coronary
syndrome
from
80%
to
87%
with
a
fall
in
specificity
from
60%
to
50%
(both
p
<
0000006)
ECG
abnormalities
are
an
early
manifestation
of
acute
coronary
syndromes
and
can
be
identified
by
the
prehospital
ECG
Compared
with
a
single
ECG
the
additional
effect
of
evolving
ST
segment
T
or
Q
waves
or
LBBB
between
serially
obtained
prehospital
and
hospital
ECGs
enhanced
the
diagnosis
of
acute
coronary
syndromes
but
with
a
fall
in
specificity
