Title
Cyclical
progestogens
for
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
Abstract
Text
Excessively
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
(HMB)
or
menorrhagia
is
an
important
cause
of
ill
health
in
women
Eighty
per
cent
of
women
treated
for
HMB
have
no
anatomical
pathology
which
makes
medical
therapy
with
the
avoidance
of
possibly
unnecessary
surgery
an
attractive
alternative
Of
the
wide
variety
of
medications
used
to
reduce
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
oral
progestogens
are
the
most
commonly
prescribed
This
review
assesses
the
effectiveness
of
two
different
regimens
of
oral
progestogens
in
reducing
ovulatory
HMB
The
primary
objective
of
this
review
was
to
investigate
the
effectiveness
of
oral
progestogen
therapy
taken
either
during
the
luteal
phase
or
for
a
longer
course
of
21
days
in
achieving
a
reduction
in
menstrual
blood
loss
in
women
of
reproductive
years
with
heavy
menstrual
bleeding
(HMB)
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Menstrual
Disorders
and
Subfertility
Group
Trials
Register
(searched
April
2007)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
April
2007)
and
EMBASE
(1985
to
April
2007)
Attempts
were
also
made
to
identify
trials
from
citation
lists
of
review
articles
In
most
cases
the
first
author
of
each
included
trial
was
contacted
The
inclusion
criteria
were
randomised
comparisons
of
oral
progestogen
therapy
versus
placebo
or
other
medical
treatments
in
women
of
reproductive
years
with
regular
heavy
periods
measured
either
objectively
or
subjectively
and
with
no
pathological
or
iatrogenic
causes
for
their
heavy
menstrual
blood
loss
Seven
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
were
identified
that
fulfilled
the
inclusion
criteria
The
review
authors
extracted
the
data
independently
Odds
ratios
for
dichotomous
outcomes
and
weighted
mean
differences
for
continuous
outcomes
were
estimated
from
the
data
No
RCTs
comparing
progestogen
treatment
with
placebo
were
identified
Comparisons
between
oral
progestogens
and
other
medical
therapies
were
assessed
separately
according
to
dosage
regimenProgestogen
therapy
during
the
luteal
phase
was
significantly
less
effective
at
reducing
menstrual
blood
loss
when
compared
with
tranexamic
acid
danazol
and
the
progesterone-releasing
intrauterine
system
(IUS)
Duration
of
menstruation
was
significantly
longer
with
the
progesterone
IUS
when
compared
with
oral
progestogen
therapy
but
significantly
shorter
with
danazol
treatment
Adverse
events
were
significantly
more
likely
with
danazol
when
compared
with
progestogen
treatment
Progestogen
therapy
from
day
5
to
day
26
of
the
menstrual
cycle
was
significantly
less
effective
at
reducing
menstrual
blood
loss
than
the
IUS
A
significantly
higher
proportion
of
norethisterone
(NET)
patients
taking
progestogens
found
their
treatment
unacceptable
compared
to
IUS
patients
However
the
adverse
effects
of
breast
tenderness
and
intermenstrual
bleeding
were
more
likely
in
women
with
the
IUS
Progestogens
administered
from
day
15
or
19
to
day
26
of
the
cycle
offer
no
advantage
over
other
medical
therapies
such
as
danazol
tranexamic
acid
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
and
the
IUS
in
the
treatment
of
menorrhagia
in
women
with
ovulatory
cycles
Progestogen
therapy
for
21
days
of
the
cycle
results
in
a
significant
reduction
in
menstrual
blood
loss
although
women
found
the
treatment
less
acceptable
than
intrauterine
levonorgestrel
This
regimen
of
progestogen
may
have
a
role
in
the
short-term
treatment
of
menorrhagia
