Title
Recurrence
and
care
seeking
after
acute
back
pain
results
of
a
long-term
follow-up
study
North
Carolina
Back
Pain
Project
Abstract
Text
To
explore
the
relationship
between
type
of
initial
care
as
well
as
the
likelihood
of
recurrence
and
consequent
care
seeking
behavior
Prospective
observational
cohort
recruited
from
208
randomly
selected
North
Carolina
practices
Cohort
study
examined
the
recurrence
of
low
back
pain
among
patients
free
of
back
pain
3
months
after
their
index
visit
to
a
practitioner
for
that
problem
The
following
four
practitioner
strata
were
examined
primary
care
providers
chiropractors
orthopedic
surgeons
and
practitioners
in
a
group
model
HMO
Patients
were
interviewed
by
telephone
at
6
and
22
months
after
the
initial
visit
Rates
of
disabling
and
non-disabling
low
back
pain
functional
status
using
the
Roland
back
disability
scale
and
care
seeking
Rates
of
recurrence
were
substantial
functionally
disabling
recurrence
rates
varied
between
8%
and
14%
between
3
to
6
months
and
20%
to
35%
between
6
to
22
months
Differences
in
rates
among
practitioner
strata
were
statistically
significant
only
between
6
to
22
months
with
higher
recurrence
rates
for
HMO
patients
Functional
status
number
of
bed
days
and
time
off
work
were
very
similar
among
the
practitioner
strata
Care
seeking
however
was
greater
among
those
patients
who
had
initially
seen
a
chiropractor
for
their
back
pain
Patients
with
recurrence
saw
the
same
practitioner
type
they
had
seen
for
the
index
episode
88%
of
the
time
Satisfaction
was
slightly
greater
for
patients
who
saw
chiropractors
when
compared
with
patients
seeing
allopathic
physicians
The
recurrence
of
low
back
pain
is
common
Severe
disability
is
rare
Patients
who
had
sought
care
from
chiropractors
are
more
likely
to
return
for
recurrences
than
patients
who
had
initially
sought
care
from
MDs
