Title
Screening
for
endometrial
cancer
in
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
with
conventional
and
colour
Doppler
sonography
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
endometrial
thickness
and
uterine
arterial
flow
measurement
as
predictors
of
endometrial
cancer
Prospective
study
among
a
cohort
of
women
invited
to
age-adjusted
population-based
breast
cancer
screening
by
mammography
City
of
Turku
Finland
1074
postmenopausal
women
aged
57-61
years
(mean
59
years)
Conventional
and
colour
Doppler
sonography
Endometrial
biopsy
was
taken
when
the
endometrial
thickness
(double
layer)
was
>
or
=
40
mm
if
the
uterine
artery
pulsatility
index
was
<
or
=
10
or
if
there
was
a
fluid
accumulation
in
the
endometrial
cavity
Detection

in
endometrial
biopsy
Record
linkage

the
files

Cancer
Registry
three
and
a
half
years
after
the
first
ultrasound
examination
Major
statistical
results
are
based
on
the
analysis
of
variance
and
logistic
regression
models
An
endometrial
biopsy
was
taken
from
291
women
(27%)
One
woman
had
endometrial
tuberculosis
three
an
endometrial
polyp
16
endometrial
hyperplasia
three
endometrial
carcinoma
(Stage
Ib)
and
one
had
cervical
carcinoma
(Stage
Ib)
One
woman
was
diagnosed
as
having
endometrial
cancer
Stage
Ib
two
and
a
half
years
after
screening
she
had
refused
further
examination
after
a
positive
screen
A
second
endometrial
cancer
(Stage
Ib)
was
diagnosed
three
years
after
a
negative
screening
result
Transvaginal
sonography
is
confirmed
to
have
a
very
high
sensitivity
for
the
detection
of
early
endometrial
carcinoma
but
the
specificity
remains
low
If
endometrial
cancer
is
to
be
detected
at
an
early
stage
further
examinations
should
be
carried
out
when
the
endometrial
thickness
is
>
or
=
40
mm
especially
when
the
woman
has
risk
factors
such
as
obesity
late
menopause
or
current
use
of
hormonal
replacement
therapy
Doppler
sonography
does
not
improve
the
detection
of
premalignant
and
malignant
endometrial
lesions
compared
with
normal
ultrasound
