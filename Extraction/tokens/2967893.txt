Abstract
Text
Back
pain
is
very
common
Rarely
it
may
be
the
first
manifestation
of
cancer
Although
many
advocate
selective
use
of
laboratory
and
x-ray
tests
for
back
pain
patients
the
early
detection
of
cancer
may
be
an
important
reason
to
obtain
such
tests
To
develop
a
diagnostic
approach
that
would
identify
malignancies
while
remaining
parsimonious
the
authors
evaluated
1975
walk-in
patients
with
a
chief
complaint
of
back
pain
Thirteen
patients
(066%)
proved
to
have
underlying
cancer
Findings
significantly
associated
with
underlying
cancer
(p
less
than
005)
were
age
greater
than
or
equal
to
50
years
previous
history
of
cancer
duration
of
pain
greater
than
1
month
failure
to
improve
with
conservative
therapy
elevated
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
(ESR)
and
anemia
Combining
historical
features
and
ESR
results
led
to
an
algorithm
that
would
have
limited
x-ray
utilization
to
just
22%
of
subjects
while
recommending
an
x-ray
for
every
cancer
patient
It
would
further
suggest
which
patients
with
negative
x-ray
findings
require
further
work-up
