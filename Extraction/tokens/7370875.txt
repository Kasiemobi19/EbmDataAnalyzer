Title
Hypokalemia
during
the
treatment
of
arterial
hypertension
with
diuretics
Abstract
Text
In
a
study
of
50
patients
with
uncomplicated
arterial
hypertension
the
administration
of
hydrochlorothiazide
50
to
100
mg
daily
or
every
other
day
with
or
without
reserpine
025
mg
daily
resulted
in
a
fall
in
the
mean
blood
pressure
from
182/113
to
144/92
mm
Hg
The
mean
duration
of
therapy
was
19
months
The
mean
serum
potassium
concentration
was
43
mmol/l
before
the
onset
of
therapy
It
fell
during
the
first
6
weeks
of
treatment
but
seldom
below
35
mmol/l
then
rose
gradually
and
spontaneously
to
41
mmol/l
after
19
months
of
therapy
All
the
patients
remained
asymptomatic
These
findings
bring
into
question
the
routine
use
of
potassium
supplements
or
a
potassium-sparing
diuretic
such
as
spironolactone
or
triamterene
during
the
treatment
of
hypertension
with
diuretics
such
as
the
thiazides
The
use
of
potassium
supplements
or
a
potassium-sparing
agent
may
induce
hyperkalemia
in
spite
of
the
simultaneous
administration
of
a
diuretic
that
acts
more
proximally
Since
hyperkalemia
is
potentially
lethal
the
serum
potassium
concentration
should
be
carefully
monitored
in
any
patient
receiving
potassium
supplements
or
a
potassium-sparing
agent
