Abstract
Text
Patients
with
hypertension
and
renal-artery
stenosis
are
often
treated
with
percutaneous
transluminal
renal
angioplasty
However
the
long-term
effects
of
this
procedure
on
blood
pressure
are
not
well
understood
We
randomly
assigned
106
patients
with
hypertension
who
had
atherosclerotic
renal-artery
stenosis
(defined
as
a
decrease
in
luminal
diameter
of
50
percent
or
more)
and
a
serum
creatinine
concentration
of
23
mg
per
deciliter
(200
micromol
per
liter)
or
less
to
undergo
percutaneous
transluminal
renal
angioplasty
or
to
receive
drug
therapy
To
be
included
patients
also
had
to
have
a
diastolic
blood
pressure
of
95
mm
Hg
or
higher
despite
treatment
with
two
antihypertensive
drugs
or
an
increase
of
at
least
02
mg
per
deciliter
(20
micromol
per
liter)
in
the
serum
creatinine
concentration
during
treatment
with
an
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor
Blood
pressure
doses
of
antihypertensive
drugs
and
renal
function
were
assessed
at
3
and
12
months
and
patency
of
the
renal
artery
was
assessed
at
12
months
At
base
line
the
mean
(+/-SD)
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
were
179+/-25
and
104+/-10
mm
Hg
respectively
in
the
angioplasty
group
and
180+/-23
and
103+/-8
mm
Hg
respectively
in
the
drug-therapy
group
At
three
months
the
blood
pressures
were
similar
in
the
two
groups
(169+/-28
and
99+/-12
mm
Hg
respectively
in
the
56
patients
in
the
angioplasty
group
and
176+/-31
and
101+/-14
mm
Hg
respectively
in
the
50
patients
in
the
drug-therapy
group
P=025
for
the
comparison
of
systolic
pressure
and
P=036
for
the
comparison
of
diastolic
pressure
between
the
two
groups)
at
the
time
patients
in
the
angioplasty
group
were
taking
21+/-13
defined
daily
doses
of
medication
and
those
in
the
drug-therapy
group
were
taking
32+/-15
daily
doses
(P<0001)
In
the
drug-therapy
group
22
patients
underwent
balloon
angioplasty
after
three
months
because
of
persistent
hypertension
despite
treatment
with
three
or
more
drugs
or
because
of
a
deterioration
in
renal
function
According
to
intention-to-treat
analysis
at
12
months
there
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
angioplasty
and
drug-therapy
groups
in
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
daily
drug
doses
or
renal
function
In
the
treatment
of
patients
with
hypertension
and
renal-artery
stenosis
angioplasty
has
little
advantage
over
antihypertensive-drug
therapy
