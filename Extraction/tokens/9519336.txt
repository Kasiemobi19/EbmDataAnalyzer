Abstract
Text
The
Münster
Heart
Study
(PROCAM)
was
initiated
in
1979
in
order
to
examine
cardiovascular
risk
factors
cardiovascular
events
including
myocardial
infarction
and
stroke
and
mortality
in
people
at
work
Examination
at
entry
comprised
a
standardized
case
history
measurement
of
blood
pressure
and
anthropometric
data
a
resting
electrocardiogram
and
measurement
of
more
than
20
laboratory
parameters
in
a
fasting
blood
sample
The
prevalence
data
in
this
report
are
based
upon
a
single
examination
of
17437
men
aged
404
+/-
113
years
(mean
+/-
SD)
and
8065
women
aged
357
+/-
121
years
which
took
place
between
1979
and
1991
Severe
hypercholesterolaemia
(>
300
mgdl-1)
was
seen
in
5%
of
men
and
8%
of
women
aged
45
to
64
years
In
men
the
prevalence
of
hypertriglyceridaemia
(>
200
mgdl-1)
rose
from
5%
at
age
20
to
20%
at
age
45
and
remained
constant
thereafter
in
women
the
prevalence
of
hypertriglyceridaemia
increased
linearly
from
2%
at
age
20
to
7%
at
age
60
The
LDL/HDL
ratio
was
higher
in
men
than
in
women
at
all
age
groups
in
the
age
group
45
to
64
years
LDL/HDL
ratios
>
5
were
approximately
twice
as
common
in
men
Lipoprotein(a)
levels
were
distributed
in
a
highly
skewed
fashion
In
men
a
slight
rise
in
the
geometric
mean
lipoprotein(a)
concentration
occurred
with
age
whereas
in
women
a
dramatic
increase
was
seen
after
age
40
Using
multivariate
analysis
by
the
multiple
logistic
function
method
total
cholesterol
HDL
cholesterol
LDL
cholesterol
and
log-transformed
triglycerides
showed
a
significant
(P
<
0001)
age-adjusted
correlation
with
the
presence
of
major
coronary
events
A
risk
algorithm
has
been
developed
for
men
aged
40
to
65
years
which
takes
into
account
the
independent
risk
factors
of
HDL
cholesterol
LDL
cholesterol
triglycerides
fibrinogen
age
systolic
blood
pressure
cigarette
smoking
presence
of
diabetes
mellitus
and
family
history
of
myocardial
infarction
and
angina
pectoris
This
algorithm
can
be
used
in
clinical
practice
to
calculate
the
8-year
risk
of
an
individual
suffering
a
myocardial
infarction
