Breast
implants
and
cancer
causation
delayed

Abstract
Text
Concern
for
many
women
with
breast
implants
has
been
focused
on
three
topics
cancer
(both
breast
and
other
cancers)
delayed
detection
of
breast
cancer
and
increased
breast
cancer
recurrence
or
decreased
length
of
survival
In
this
study
a
qualitative
review
of
the
literature
on
these
subjects
was
conducted
coupled
with
a
meta-analysis
of
the
risk
for
breast
cancer
or
other
cancers
(excluding
that
of
the
breast)
Researchers
have
consistently
found
no
persuasive
evidence
of
a
causal
association
between
breast
implants
and
any
type
of
cancer
The
meta-analysis
results
obtained
by
combining
the
epidemiology
studies
support
the
overall
conclusion
that
breast
implants
do
not
pose
any
additional
risk
for
breast
cancer
(relative
risk
072
95%
confidence
interval
061
to
085)
or
for
other
cancers
(relative
risk
103
95%
confidence
interval
087
to
124)
This
analysis
suggests
that
breast
implants
may
confer
a
protective
effect
against
breast
cancer
Women
with
implants
should
be
reassured
by
the
consistency
of
scientific
studies
which
have
uniformly
determined
that
compared
with
women
without
implants
they
are
not
at
increased
risk
for
cancer
are
not
diagnosed
with
later-stage
breast
malignancies
are
not
at
increased
risk
for
breast
cancer
recurrence
and
do
not
have
a
decreased
length
of
survival
