Cost-effectiveness
of
alternative

for
atypical

Abstract
Text
Every
year
approximately
2
million
US
women
are
diagnosed
as
having
a
cervical
cytological
result
of
atypical
squamous
cells
of
undetermined
significance
(ASC-US)
To
determine
the
most
efficient
and
cost-effective
management
strategy
for
women
in
the
United
States
diagnosed
as
having
ASC-US
Cost-effectiveness
analysis
of
data
from
clinical
trials
prospective
studies
and
other
published
literature
A
computer-based
model
was
used
to
compare
4
management
strategies
for
a
cytological
result
of
ASC-US
immediate
colposcopy
human
papillomavirus
(HPV)
triage
which
includes
colposcopy
if
high-risk
HPV
types
are
detected
repeat
cytology
which
includes
follow-up
cytology
at
6
and
12
months
and
referral
for
colposcopy
if
a
repeat
abnormal
result
occurs
and
reclassifying
ASC-US
as
normal
in
which
a
cytological
result
of
ASC-US
is
ignored
Reflex
HPV
DNA
testing
uses
either
residual
liquid-based
cytological
specimens
or
samples
co-collected
at
the
time
of
the
initial
screening
for
conventional
cytology
Another
method
referred
to
as
the
2-visit
HPV
DNA
triage
requires
a
woman
with
an
ASC-US
result
to
return
within
1
month
to
provide
another
speciman
sample
Years
of
life
saved
(YLS)
quality-adjusted
life-years
(QALYs)
and
incremental
cost-effectiveness
ratios
The
least
costly
strategy
for
biennial
screening
was
to
reclassify
ASC-US
as
normal
resulting
in
a
reduction
in
total
cancer
incidence
of
75%
for
conventional
cytology
and
84%
for
liquid-based
cytology
compared
with
no
screening
The
next
least
costly
strategy
was
HPV
DNA
testing
resulting
in
a
reduction
in
total
cancer
incidence
of
86%
for
conventional
cytology
and
90%
for
liquid-based
cytology
followed
by
immediate
colposcopy
with
a
reduction
of
87%
and
91%
respectively
Compared
with
reflex
HPV
DNA
testing
a
strategy
of
repeat
cervical
cytology
or
delayed
HPV
testing
costs
more
but
is
less
effective
When
all
strategies
were
compared
simultaneously
varying
frequency
and
type
of
cytological
test
biennial
(vs
every
3
years)
liquid-based
cytology
with
reflex
HPV
testing
had
a
cost
of
$174
200
per
YLS
In
a
similar
comparison
liquid-based
cytology
with
reflex
HPV
testing
conducted
every
3
years
(vs
every
5
years)
had
a
cost
of
$59
600
per
YLS
and
was
more
effective
and
less
costly
than
a
strategy
of
conventional
cytology
incorporating
repeat
cytology
or
immediate
colposcopy
conducted
biennially
Reflex
HPV
DNA
testing
provides
the
same
or
greater
life
expectancy
benefits
and
is
more
cost-effective
than
other
management
strategies
for
women
diagnosed
as
having
ASC-US
