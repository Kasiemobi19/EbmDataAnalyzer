Study
Abstract
Text
Patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
(AF)
can
be
managed
either
by
maintaining
sinus
rhythm
using
antiarrhythmic
drugs
and/or
electrical
cardioversion
or
by
leaving
patients
in
AF
and
controlling
ventricular
rate
without
attempts
to
restore
sinus
rhythm
Which
of
these
two
strategies
is
superior
has
not
yet
been
definitively
established
HOT
CAFE
Polish
Study
(How
To
Treat
Chronic
Atrial
Fibrillation)
was
designed
to
evaluate
in
a
randomised
multicentre
and
prospective
manner
the
risks
and
advantages
of
two
therapeutical
strategies
-
rate
control
or
rhythm
control
in
patients
with
persistent
AF
The
study
group
consisted
of
205
patients
(71
females
and
134
males
mean
age
608+/-112
years)
with
a
mean
time
of
AF
duration
of
2737+/-1124
days
101
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
rate
control
(Group
I)
whereas
104
patients
were
randomised
to
sinus
rhythm
(SR)
restoration
by
DC
cardioversion
(CV)
and
subsequent
antiarrhythmic
drug
treatment
(Group
II)
At
the
end
of
follow-up
(12
months)
SR
was
present
in
75%
of
patients
The
incidence
of
hospital
admissions
was
higher
in
group
II
in
comparison
to
group
I
(12%
vs
74%
p<0001)
Mortality
was
similar
in
both
groups
(10%
versus
29%
NS)
In
both
groups
a
significant
improvement
of
heart
failure
symptoms
was
observed
during
the
first
2
months
(p<002
and
p<0001)
In
group
II
exercise
tolerability
measured
by
maximal
workload
during
treadmill
test
significantly
improved
compared
with
baseline
(52+/-51
vs
76+/-33
MET
p<00001)
In
patients
in
whom
SR
was
restored
the
left
ventricular
function
improved
and
an
increase
in
the
shortening
fraction
was
observed
(29+/-7%
vs
31+/-7%
p<001)
No
thromboembolic
complications
were
observed
in
patients
left
with
AF
Three
patients
from
group
II
suffered
ischaemic
stroke
in
two
cases
stroke
was
associated
with
CV
whereas
in
the
third
patient
-
with
late
AF
recurrence
The
HOT
CAFE
Polish
Study
did
not
reveal
significant
differences
in
mortality
between
the
two
treatment
strategies
in
patients
with
persistent
AF
Although
patients
with
SR
had
better
improvement
in
some
haemodynamical
parameters
the
hospitalisation
rate
was
higher
and
the
incidence
of
stroke
was
not
reduced
compared
with
the
rate
control
group
