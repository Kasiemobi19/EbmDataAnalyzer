The
sydney
multicentre
study
of
Parkinson's
disease
progression
and
mortality
at
10
years
Abstract
Text
To
report
on
a
10
year
follow
up
of
patients
with
idiopathic
Parkinson's
disease
particularly
with
respect
to
mortality
and
the
effect
of
early
treatment
with
bromocriptine
The
patients
are
from
the
149
new
patients
recruited
for
a
double
blind
randomised
study
of
low
dose
levodopa-carbidopa
versus
low
dose
bromocriptine
Patients
were
examined
neurologically
at
least
yearly
Neuropsychological
examinations
were
performed
at
0
3
5
and
10
years
Mortality
and
cause
of
death
in
these
patients
were
compared
with
the
Australian
population
using
standardised
mortality
ratios
(SMRs)
Mortality
and
disease
progression
were
compared
by
sex
and
treatment
group
Predictors
of
death
within
10
years
nursing
home
admission
and
progression
in
Columbia
score
of
>/=20
points
were
examined
by
logistic
regression
analysis
Thirteen
patients
were
excluded
as
having
atypical
Parkinsonism
and
six
were
lost
to
follow
up
All
available
patients
have
been
followed
up
for
10
years
Fifty
patients
(38%)
were
dead
by
10
years
and
63
by
the
last
follow
up
The
SMR
was
158
for
all
patients
(p<0
001)
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
SMRs
between
the
sexes
The
mean
duration
of
disease
until
death
was
91
years
Parkinson's
disease
was
thought
to
have
contributed
substantially
to
the
death
of
30
patients
The
most
common
cause
of
death
was
pneumonia
Women
progressed
at
a
similar
rate
to
men
until
8
years
when
the
severity
of
their
disease
as
measured
by
Hoehn
and
Yahr
stage
became
greater
(p<005)
Older
age
of
onset
correlated
with
increased
risk
of
death
but
the
SMR
was
increased
even
in
those
aged
<70
years
(SMR
180
p=003)
Early
use
of
bromocriptine
did
not
reduce
mortality
or
slow
progression
of
disease
One
quarter
of
all
patients
had
been
admitted
to
nursing
homes
by
10
years
Only
four
patients
were
still
employed
Mortality
in
Parkinson's
disease
remains
increased
despite
low
dose
levodopa-carbidopa
therapy
and
no
additional
benefit
was
gained
from
early
use
of
bromocriptine
Duration
of
disease
was
similar
to
that
in
the
era
before
levodopa
