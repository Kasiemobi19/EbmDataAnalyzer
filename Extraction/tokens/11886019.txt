Abstract
Text
To
determine
by
meta-analysis
the
effect
size
for
stimulants
on
overt
and
covert
aggression-related
behaviors
in
children
with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
separately
from
stimulant
effects
on
the
core
symptoms
of
ADHD
A
review
of
the
literature
from
1970
to
2001
revealed
28
studies
meeting
inclusion/exclusion
criteria
for
meta-analysis
These
studies
yielded
28
independent
effects
of
overt
aggression
and
7
independent
effects
of
covert
aggression
The
overall
weighted
mean
effect
size
was
084
for
overt
and
069
for
covert
aggression
related
behaviors
in
ADHD
Comorbid
conduct
disorder
is
associated
with
diminishing
stimulant
effect
size
for
overt
aggression
Stimulant
effects
for
aggression-related
behaviors
in
ADHD
have
effect
sizes
similar
to
those
for
the
core
symptoms
of
ADHD
