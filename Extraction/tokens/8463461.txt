Long-term
oral
antibiotics
for
acne
is
laboratory
monitoring
necessary
Abstract
Text
The
role
of
laboratory
monitoring
in
patients
receiving
long-term
oral
antibiotics
for
acne
vulgaris
has
not
been
clearly
defined
The
purpose
of
our
study
was
(1)
to
evaluate
the
literature
for
objective
evidence
on
the
value
of
routine
laboratory
monitoring
of
the
asymptomatic
patient
receiving
oral
antibiotics
for
acne
and
(2)
to
determine
the
utilization
of
laboratory
monitoring
of
these
patients
by
Connecticut
dermatologists
We
surveyed
Connecticut
dermatologists
by
phone
and
inquired
about
the
laboratory
monitoring
performed
in
patients
receiving
long-term
oral
tetracycline
minocycline
or
erythromycin
for
acne
Eight
published
studies
reported
a
total
of
777
patients
who
had
laboratory
monitoring
at
various
frequencies
while
receiving
oral
antibiotics
for
acne
Only
one
adverse
drug
reaction
(ADR)
was
detected
in
a
patient
in
whom
mild
hyperbilirubinemia
developed
Of
the
75
Connecticut
dermatologists
who
participated
in
our
survey
48
(64%)
perform
some
laboratory
monitoring
29%
do
so
routinely
and
35%
under
special
circumstances
Our
literature
review
does
not
support
routine
laboratory
monitoring
in
all
patients
who
receive
long-term
oral
antibiotics
for
acne
rarely
does
such
screening
detect
an
ADR
and
thus
does
not
justify
the
cost
of
such
testing
A
relatively
small
proportion
of
Connecticut
dermatologists
check
laboratory
tests
more
frequently
than
appears
necessary
in
our
opinion
laboratory
monitoring
should
be
limited
to
patients
who
may
be
at
higher
risk
for
an
ADR
