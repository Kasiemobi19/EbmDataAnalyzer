Comparison
of
ofloxacin
and

for
the
treatment
of
bacterial
vaginosis
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
and
safety
of
ofloxacin
200
mg
twice
daily
for
7
days
was
compared
with
metronidazole
400
mg
twice
daily
for
7
days
for
the
treatment
of
bacterial
vaginosis
(BV)
Diagnosis
of
BV
was
confirmed
by
at
least
3
of
the
following
4
criteria
the
presence
of
an
abnormal
vaginal
discharge
on
examination
clue
cells
on
microscopy
of
vaginal
specimens
vaginal
pH
greater
than
50
and
a
positive
amine
test
Vaginal
specimens
were
examined
for
Mobiluncus
spp
analysed
for
the
succinate/lactate
(S/L)
ratio
and
cultured
for
Trichomonas
vaginalis
Gardnerella
vaginalis
Bacteroides
spp
and
Mycoplasma
hominis
Patients
were
reviewed
on
completion
of
treatment
(visit
2)
and
14
days
later
(visit
3)
The
diagnosis
of
BV
was
accepted
in
119
of
149
patients
recruited
60
of
whom
received
treatment
with
ofloxacin
and
59
received
metronidazole
Sixty-two
patients
31
in
each
treatment
group
completed
the
study
Diagnostic
cure
at
visit
2
was
significantly
better
in
the
metronidazole
group
with
cure
rates
of
56%
(metronidazole)
vs
23%
(ofloxacin)
(P
=
0001)
this
was
associated
with
higher
eradication
rates
for
G
vaginalis
(100%
vs
56%)
and
Bacteroides
spp
(97%
vs
49%)
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
two
groups
in
clinical
cure
at
either
visit
2
or
3
or
in
diagnostic
cure
at
visit
3
Both
treatments
were
well
tolerated
We
conclude
that
metronidazole
is
likely
to
remain
the
first
choice
of
treatment
for
BV
but
ofloxacin
offers
a
safe
and
effective
alternative
