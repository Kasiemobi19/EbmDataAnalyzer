Text
To
develop
guidelines
for
the
care
of
infants
and
children
from
birth
to
36
months
of
age
with
fever
without
source
An
expert
panel
of
senior
academic
faculty
with
expertise
in
pediatrics
and
infectious
diseases
or
emergency
medicine
A
comprehensive
literature
search
was
used
to
identify
all
publications
pertinent
to
the
management
of
the
febrile
child
When
appropriate
meta-analysis
was
used
to
combine
the
results
of
multiple
studies
One
or
more
specific
management
strategies
were
proposed
for
each
of
the
decision
nodes
in
draft
management
algorithms
The
draft
algorithms
selected
publications
and
the
meta-analyses
were
provided
to
the
panel
which
determined
the
final
guidelines
using
the
modified
Delphi
technique
All
toxic-appearing
infants
and
children
and
all
febrile
infants
less
than
28
days
of
age
should
be
hospitalized
for
parenteral
antibiotic
therapy
Febrile
infants
28
to
90
days
of
age
defined
at
low
risk
by
specific
clinical
and
laboratory
criteria
may
be
managed
as
outpatients
if
close
follow-up
is
assured
Older
children
with
fever
less
than
390
C
without
source
need
no
laboratory
tests
or
antibiotics
Children
3
to
36
months
of
age
with
fever
of
390
C
or
more
and
whose
WBC
count
is
15000/mm3
or
more
should
have
a
blood
culture
and
be
treated
with
antibiotics
pending
culture
results
Urine
cultures
should
be
obtained
from
all
boys
6
months
of
age
or
less
and
all
girls
2
years
of
age
or
less
who
are
treated
with
antibiotics
These
guidelines
do
not
eliminate
all
risk
or
strictly
confine
antibiotic
treatment
to
children
likely
to
have
occult
bacteremia
Physicians
may
individualize
therapy
based
on
clinical
circumstances
or
adopt
a
variation
of
these
guidelines
based
on
a
different
interpretation
of
the
evidence
