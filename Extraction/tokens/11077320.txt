Title
Lipid
risk
profile
and
weight
stability
after
gastric
restrictive
operations
for
morbid
obesity
Abstract
Text
There
are
no
longitudinal
data
that
address
weight
loss
stability
and
lipid
levels
in
bariatric
surgical
patients
The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
weight
regain
adversely
affected
reduction
in
lipid
levels
after
gastric
bariatric
operations
Of
651
consecutive
patients
undergoing
gastric
restrictive
surgery
for
morbid
obesity
227
(35%)
had
increased
serum
levels
of
total
cholesterol
(TC)
triglycerides
or
both
preoperatively
High-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
levels
were
subnormal
(</=35
mg/dl)
in
45
(20%)
of
the
hyperlipidemic
patients
Fasting
lipid
profiles
were
determined
at
6-month
intervals
postoperatively
This
series
included
the
following
three
operations
gastroplasty
(GP
N
=
13)
standard
Roux-en-Y
gastric
bypass
(RYGB
N
=
205)
and
distal
Roux-en-Y
gastric
bypass
(DRY
N
=
9)
By
6
months
postoperatively
patients
had
a
>/=15%
mean
reduction
in
TC
and
a
>/=50%
mean
reduction
in
triglycerides
both
of
which
were
significant
in
comparison
with
preoperative
levels
(P
</=005)
Mean
HDL-C
levels
had
increased
significantly
vs
preoperative
levels
by
12
months
postoperative
y
(P
<005)
and
continued
to
increase
through
5
years
By
18
months
both
HDL-C
and
TC
were
significantly
lower
after
DRY
than
after
GP
or
RYGB
In
91
patients
who
were
followed
for
2
years
or
longer
(mean
48
+/-
25
months)
mean
excess
weight
loss
was
55%
with
mean
body
mass
index
reduced
from
48
to
33
kg/m(2)
This
group
was
divided
into
patients
whose
weight
remained
stable
(N
=
54)
and
patients
who
regained
>/=15%
of
their
lost
weight
or
lost
less
than
50%
of
excess
weight
(N
=
37)
Although
mean
excess
weight
loss
and
body
mass
index
were
significantly
different
between
the
two
groups
(P
<00001)
at
2
years
there
was
no
difference
in
the
lipid
profile
(TC/HDL)
between
the
two
groups
at
any
interval
through
5
years
These
results
show
that
abnormal
lipid
profiles
can
be
permanently
improved
after
gastric
bariatric
surgery
and
are
not
adversely
affected
by
mediocre
weight
loss
or
regaining
>/=15%
of
lost
weight
DRY
appears
to
be
a
superior
operation
for
TC
reduction
in
comparison
with
GP
and
RYGB
