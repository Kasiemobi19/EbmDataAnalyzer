Abstract
Text
We
investigated
the
relationship
between
patient
knowledge
awareness
and
delay
in
seeking
medical
attention
for
melanoma
The
study
population
was
comprised
of
255
cases
with
cutaneous
melanoma
newly
diagnosed
during
January
15
1987
to
May
15
1989
who
were
part
of
a
population-based
case
control
study
Personal
interviews
were
conducted
to
obtain
information
on
patient's
knowledge
of
melanoma
signs
and
symptoms
skin
awareness
delay
in
seeking
medical
attention
and
related
covariates
The
adjusted
odds
ratio
for
the
association
between
skin
awareness
and
delay
was
030
(95%
confidence
interval
012-071)
Odds
ratios
ranged
from
043
to
081
for
knowledge
and
delay
Awareness
of
skin
changes
was
associated
with
a
reduced
Breslow
depth
for
stage
I
melanomas
Individuals
who
are
aware
of
skin
changes
and
abnormalities
appear
to
be
less
likely
to
delay
seeking
medical
attention
for
melanoma
Knowledge
of
melanoma
signs
and
symptoms
may
also
contribute
to
a
decreased
delay
in
melanoma
diagnosis
