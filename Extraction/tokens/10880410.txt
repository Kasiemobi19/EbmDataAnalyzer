Abstract
Text
Coronary
heart
disease
patients
with
low
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
levels
high
triglyceride
levels
or
both
are
at
an
increased
risk
of
cardiovascular
events
but
the
clinical
impact
of
raising
HDL-C
or
decreasing
triglycerides
remains
to
be
confirmed
In
a
double-blind
trial
3090
patients
with
a
previous
myocardial
infarction
or
stable
angina
total
cholesterol
of
180
to
250
mg/dL
HDL-C
<
or
=45
mg/dL
triglycerides
<
or
=300
mg/dL
and
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
<
or
=180
mg/dL
were
randomized
to
receive
either
400
mg
of
bezafibrate
per
day
or
a
placebo
they
were
followed
for
a
mean
of
62
years
The
primary
end
point
was
fatal
or
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
or
sudden
death
Bezafibrate
increased
HDL-C
by
18%
and
reduced
triglycerides
by
21%
The
frequency
of
the
primary
end
point
was
13
6%
on
bezafibrate
versus
150%
on
placebo
(P=026)
After
62
years
the
reduction
in
the
cumulative
probability
of
the
primary
end
point
was
73%
(P=024)
In
a
post
hoc
analysis
in
the
subgroup
with
high
baseline
triglycerides
(>
or
=200
mg/dL)
the
reduction
in
the
cumulative
probability
of
the
primary
end
point
by
bezafibrate
was
395%
(P=002)
Total
and
noncardiac
mortality
rates
were
similar
and
adverse
events
and
cancer
were
equally
distributed
Bezafibrate
was
safe
and
effective
in
elevating
HDL-C
levels
and
lowering
triglycerides
An
overall
trend
in
a
reduction
of
the
incidence
of
primary
end
points
was
observed
The
reduction
in
the
primary
end
point
in
patients
with
high
baseline
triglycerides
(>
or
=200
mg/dL)
requires
further
confirmation
