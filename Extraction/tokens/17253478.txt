Title
Antihypertensive
drug
therapy
for
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
during
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
Mild
to
moderate
hypertension
during
pregnancy
is
common
Antihypertensive
drugs
are
often
used
in
the
belief
that
lowering
blood
pressure
will
prevent
progression
to
more
severe
disease
and
thereby
improve
outcome
To
assess
the
effects
of
antihypertensive
drug
treatments
for
women
with
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
during
pregnancy
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group's
Trials
Register
(March
2006)
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(The

MEDLINE
(1966
to
November
2005)
LILACS
(1984
to
November
2005)
and
EMBASE
(1974
to
November
2005)
All
randomised
trials
evaluating
any
antihypertensive
drug
treatment
for
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
during
pregnancy
defined
whenever
possible
as
systolic
blood
pressure
140
to
169
mmHg
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
90
to
109
mmHg
Comparisons
were
of
one
or
more
antihypertensive
drug(s)
with
placebo
with
no
antihypertensive
drug
or
with
another
antihypertensive
drug
and
where
treatment
was
planned
to
continue
for
at
least
seven
days
Two
review
authors
independently
extracted
data
Forty-six
trials
(4282
women)
were
included
Twenty-eight
trials
compared
an
antihypertensive
drug
with
placebo/no
antihypertensive
drug
(3200
women)
There
is
a
halving
in
the
risk
of
developing
severe
hypertension
associated
with
the
use
of
antihypertensive
drug(s)
(19

but
little
evidence
of

(22

Similarly
there
is
no
clear

on
the

of

baby
dying
(26

(19

RR

There
were
no
clear
differences
in
any
other
outcomes
Nineteen
trials
(1282
women)
compared
one
antihypertensive
drug
with
another
Beta
blockers
seem
better
than
methyldopa
for
reducing
the
risk
of
severe
hypertension
(10

RD

NNT

(6
to

There
is
no
clear
difference
between
any
of
the
alternative
drugs
in
the
risk
of
developing
proteinuria/pre-eclampsia
Other
outcomes
were
only
reported
by
a
small
proportion
of
studies
and
there
were
no
clear
differences
It
remains
unclear
whether
antihypertensive
drug
therapy
for
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
during
pregnancy
is
worthwhile
