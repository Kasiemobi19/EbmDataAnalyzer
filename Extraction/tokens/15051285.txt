Male
circumcision
and
risk
of
HIV-1
and
other
sexually
transmitted
infections
in
India
Abstract
Text
Circumcised
men
have
a
lower
risk
of
HIV-1
infection
than
uncircumcised
men
Laboratory
findings
suggest
that
the
foreskin
is
enriched
with
HIV-1
target
cells
However
some
data
suggest
that
circumcision
could
simply
be
a
marker
for
low-risk
behaviours
In
a
prospective
study
of
2298
HIV-uninfected
men
attending
sexually
transmitted
infection
clinics
in
India
we
noted
that
circumcision
was
strongly
protective
against
HIV-1
infection
(adjusted
relative
risk
015
95%
CI
004-062
p=00089)
however
we
noted
no
protective
effect
against
herpes
simplex
virus
type
2
syphilis
or
gonorrhoea
The
specificity
of
this
relation
suggests
a
biological
rather
than
behavioural
explanation
for
the
protective
effect
of
male
circumcision
against
HIV-1
