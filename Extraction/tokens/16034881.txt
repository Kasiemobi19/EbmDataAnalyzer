Metformin
monotherapy
for
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
Abstract
Text
Metformin
is
an
anti-hyperglycaemic
agent
used
for
the
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
Type
2
diabetes
may
present
long-term
complications
micro-
(retinopathy
nephropathy
and
neuropathy)
and
macrovascular
(stroke
myocardial
infarction
and
peripheral
vascular
disease)
Two
meta-analyses
have
been
published
before
although
only
secondary
outcomes
were
assessed
To
assess
the
effects
of
metformin
monotherapy
on
mortality
morbidity
quality
of
life
glycaemic
control
body
weight
lipid
levels
blood
pressure
insulinaemia
and
albuminuria
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
Studies
were
obtained
from
computerised
searches
of
multiple
electronic
databases
and
hand
searches
of
reference
lists
of
relevant
trials
identified

Trials
fulfilling
the
following
inclusion
criteria
Diabetes

type
2
metformin
versus
any
other
oral
intervention
assessment
of
relevant
clinical
outcome
measures
use
of
random
allocation
Two
reviewers
extracted
data
using
a
standard
data
extraction
form
Data
were
summarised
under
a
random
effects
model
Dichotomous
data
were
expressed
as
relative
risk
We
calculated
the
risk
difference
(RD)
and
the
Number
Needed
to
Treat
when
it
was
possible
We
collected
data
of
mean
and
standard
deviation
from
changes
to
baseline
However
many
trials
reported
end
point
data
This
limitation
lead
to
the
expression
of
the
results
as
standardised
mean
differences
(SMD)
and
an
overall
SMD
was
calculated
Heterogeneity
was
tested
for
using
the
Z
score
and
the
I-squared
statistic
Subgroup
sensitivity
analysis
and
meta-regression
were
used
to
explore
heterogeneity
We
included
for
analysis
29
trials
with
37
arms
(5259
participants)
comparing
metformin
(37
arms
and
2007
participants)
with
sulphonylureas
(13
and
1167)
placebo
(12
and
702)
diet
(three
and
493)
thiazolidinediones
(three
and
132)
insulin
(two
and
439)
meglitinides
(two
and
208)
and
glucosidase
inhibitors
(two
and
111)
Nine
studies
reported
data
on
primary
outcomes
Obese
patients
allocated
to
intensive
blood
glucose
control
with
metformin
showed
a
greater
benefit
than
chlorpropamide
glibenclamide
or
insulin
for
any
diabetes-related
outcomes
(P
=
0009)
and
for
all-cause
mortality
(P
=
003)
Obese
participants
assigned
to
intensive
blood
glucose
control
with
metformin
showed
a
greater
benefit
than
overweight
patients
on
conventional
treatment
for
any
diabetes-related
outcomes
(P
=
0004)
diabetes-related
death
(P
=
003)
all-cause
mortality
(P
=
001)
and
myocardial
infarction
(P
=
002)
Patients
assigned
to
metformin
monotherapy
showed
a
significant
benefit
for
glycaemia
control
weight
dyslipidaemia
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
Metformin
presents
a
strong
benefit
for
HbA1c
when
compared
with
placebo
and
diet
and
a
moderated
benefit
for
glycaemia
control
LDL
cholesterol
and
BMI
or
weight
when
compared
with
sulphonylureas
Metformin
may
be
the
first
therapeutic
option
in
the
diabetes
mellitus
type
2
with
overweight
or
obesity
as
it
may
prevent
some
vascular
complications
and
mortality
Metformin
produces
beneficial
changes
in
glycaemia
control
and
moderated
in
weight
lipids
insulinaemia
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
Sulphonylureas
alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors
thiazolidinediones
meglitinides
insulin
and
diet
fail
to
show
more
benefit
for
glycaemia
control
body
weight
or
lipids
than
metformin
