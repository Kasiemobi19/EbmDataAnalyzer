Abstract
Text
Faecal
occult
blood
testing
is
routinely
used
for
early
detection
of
colorectal
cancer
but
evidence
of
its
efficacy
in
preventing
death
from
colorectal
cancer
is
limited
A
case-control
study
was
carried
out
to
evaluate
whether
screening
for
faecal
occult
blood
is
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
fatal
colorectal
cancer
A
health
maintenance
organisation
in
western
Washington
State
which
has
offered
its
members
faecal
occult
blood
testing
every
two
years
since
1983
Cases
(n
=
248)
were
members
of
the
health
maintenance
organisation
who
died
from
colorectal
cancer
between
1986
and
1991
For
each
case
two
control
subjects
who
did
not
die
from
colorectal
cancer
and
who
were
similar
to
each
case
in
age
gender
and
year
of
enrollment
at
the
health
maintenance
organisation
were
randomly
selected
from
the
membership
list
of
the
year
in
which
the
case
was
diagnosed
(n
=
496)
Information
about
episodes
of
faecal
occult
blood
testing
(including
the
location
and
reason
for
the
test
and
the
evaluation
of
positive
tests)
and
potential
confounders
was
obtained
from
medical
records
Cases
were
less
likely
than
controls
to
have
ever
been
screened
(odds
ratio
(OR)
=
07
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
05
to
10)
consistent
with
a
beneficial
impact
of
screening
There
was
little
difference
however
for
screening
that
had
taken
place
within
a
three
year
period
before
diagnosis
(OR
=
09
95%
CI
06
to
12)
the
maximum
interval
during
which
most
tumours
ought
to
have
been
detectable
by
faecal
occult
blood
testing
A
reduction
in
risk
was
seen
for
home
testing
but
not
for
office
testing
and
in
individuals
aged
less
than
75
but
not
in
those
aged
75
or
older
Although
most
of
the
21
controls
with
a
positive
faecal
occult
blood
test
underwent
some
additional
testing
only
five
(24%)
were
evaluated
with
colonoscopy
or
air
contrast
barium
enema
While
there
can
be
uncertainty
as
to
whether
specific
faecal
occult
blood
tests
were
performed
as
screening
or
diagnostic
tests
those
performed
at
home
and
in
younger
persons
may
be
relatively
less
likely
to
be
diagnostic
tests
that
were
misclassified
as
screening
Thus
the
modest
reduced
risk
associated
with
faecal
occult
blood
testing
in
these
settings/persons
may
reflect
genuine
benefit
However
the
presence
of
a
reduced
risk
associated
with
a
screening
faecal
occult
blood
test
received
in
the
past
well
before
a
tumour
or
polyp
might
bleed
enough
to
allow
detection
is
compatible
with
uncontrolled
confounding
Interpretation
is
further
complicated
by
the
fact
that
a
number
of
individuals
in
the
study
group
who
had
positive
test
results
underwent
limited
or
no
diagnostic
testing
Thus
our
results
should
be
interpreted
with
considerable
caution
