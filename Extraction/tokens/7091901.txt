Chronic
cough
bronchoscopy
or
pulmonary
function
testing
Abstract
Text
To
determine
how
frequently
bronchoscopic
examination
and
pulmonary
function
testing
are
useful
in
establishing
a
diagnosis
in
patients
with
chronic
cough
as
an
isolated
clinical
symptom
we
reviewed
the
records
of
all
patients
referred
to
pulmonary
specialists
at
3
community
hospitals
for
evaluation
of
cough
over
a
6-yr
period
There
were
109
patients
with
the
isolated
symptom
of
chronic
cough
and
a
normal
or
stable
chest
roentgenogram
Bronchoscopy
was
performed
in
51
All
patients
but
1
were
followed
until
the
cough
disappeared
or
for
a
minimum
of
1
yr
Carcinoma
was
established
as
the
cause
for
cough
in
1
patient
Spirometry
and/or
bronchial
inhalation
challenge
was
performed
in
87
patients
Previously
undiagnosed
asthma
was
discovered
in
39
patients
by
these
means
Pulmonary
function
testing
has
diagnostic
value
in
this
population
but
bronchoscopy
is
of
limited
value
in
determining
the
cause
of
isolated
chronic
cough
