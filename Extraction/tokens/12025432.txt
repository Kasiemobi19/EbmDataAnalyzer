Attention-deficit
hyperactivity

critical
appraisal
of
extended
treatment
studies
Abstract
Text
We
undertook
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
on
the
long-term
treatment
of
attention-deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
We
used
systematic
strategies
to
identify
randomized
treatment
studies
in
which
treatment
was
administered
for
12
weeks
or
more
We
included
14
studies
involving
1379
subjects
Because
of
the
limited
number
of
high-quality
studies
and
the
heterogeneity
of
outcome
measures
we
did
not
perform
meta-analysis
We
rated
5
studies
as
adequate
for
methodological
quality
Five
studies
followed
children
for
more
than
26
weeks
Pharmacologic
interventions
were
studied
more
frequently
than
non-pharmacologic
ones
Six
studies
permitted
evaluation
of
the
effects
of
combined
drug
and
behavioural
intervention
Twenty-five
different
outcomes
were
measured
using
26
different
tests
Stimulant
medication
appears
to
reduce
ADHD
(7
studies)
dysfunctional
social
behaviour
(6
studies)
and
internalizing
symptoms
(2
studies)
Available
studies
provide
little
evidence
for
improved
academic
performance
with
stimulants
(3
studies)
Medications
other
than
stimulants
have
not
been
studied
extensively
(3
studies)
Only
1
study
showed
that
combination
therapy
adds
to
the
effects
of
medication
Rigorous
treatment
research
among
representative
samples
of
ADHD
individuals
is
needed
