Physiotherapy
exercises

a
blinded
review
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
quality
of
randomised
controlled
trials
of
exercise
therapy
for
back
pain
Computer
aided
search
of
published
papers
and
blinded
assessment
of
the
methods
of
studies
23
randomised
controlled
trials
of
which
16
studied
exercise
therapy
given
by
physiotherapists
to
individual
patients
with
back
pain
Other
conservative
treatments
could
be
included
Score
for
quality
of
methods
(based
on
four
main
categories
study
population
interventions
measurement
of
effect
and
data
presentation
and
analysis)
and
main
conclusion
of
author(s)
with
regard
to
exercise
therapy
Only
four
studies
scored
more
than
50
points
(maximum
100)
indicating
that
most
were
of
poor
quality
Six
studies
found
that
exercise
was
better
than
reference
treatments
and
10
reported
it
to
be
no
better
or
worse
than
the
reference
treatment
Those
reporting
positive
results
tended
to
have
higher
methods
scores
(4/6
positive
v
4/10
negative
scored
greater
than
or
equal
to
42)
No
conclusion
can
be
drawn
about
whether
exercise
therapy
is
better
than
other
conservative
treatments
for
back
pain
or
whether
a
specific
type
of
exercise
is
more
effective
Further
trials
are
needed
in
which
greater
attention
is
paid
to
methods
of
study
