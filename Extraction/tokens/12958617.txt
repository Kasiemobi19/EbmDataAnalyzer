Platelet
hyperactivity
after
statin
treatment
discontinuation
Abstract
Text
Hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA-reductase
inhibitors
(statins)
reduce
cardiovascular
events
by
cholesterol
lowering
as
well
as
by
non-lipid
related
actions
Among
them
the
modulation
of
platelet
activity
could
play
a
relevant
role
in
vascular
protection
Furthermore
withdrawal
of
statins
has
been
associated
with
increased
cardiovascular
event
rate
The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
evaluate
platelet
activity
after
cerivastatin
discontinuation
in
eighteen
subjects
that
did
not
accept
other
drugs
and
in
sixteen
subjects
continuing
treatment
with
simvastatin
Fourteen
subjects
at
the
end
of
the
discontinuation
period
decided
to
receive
other
drugs
(simvastatin)
and
they
were
evaluted
six
weeks
later
We
measured
complete
lipid
profile
by
the
chromogenic
method
(LDL-C
was
calculated)
oxidized-LDL
(ox-LDL
ELISA)
platelet
P-selectin
(P-sel)
expression
(flow
cytometry
detection)
platelet
aggregation
(%
change
of
transmitted
light)
intracellular
citrullin
production
(iCit
HPLC)
as
an
indicator
of
intracellular
NO
synthase
activity
at
baseline
and
7
14
28
60
days
after
statin
discontinuation
P-sel
expression
and
platelet
aggregation
were
increased
at
14
days
(p
<
0001
and
p
<
005)
in
association
with
raised
ox-LDL
(r
=
030
p
<
005)
and
decreased
iCit
(r
=
053
p
<
001)
Increased
LDL-C
was
related
to
P-sel
and
platelet
aggregation
at
28
days
(r
=
030
p
<
005)
Subjects
continuing
statin
treatment
had
no
significant
changes
of
P-sel
at
28
(p
=
0221)
and
60
days
(p
=
0238)
Subjects
treated
with
simvastatin
after
60
days
of
diet
showed
a
significant
reduction
of
P-sel
and
platelet
aggregation
after
six
weeks
of
treatment
(p
<
001)
Our
data
suggest
a
platelet
hyperactivation
state
in
the
second
week
after
statin
discontinuation
which
is
partially
related
to
raised
LDL-C
Such
a
finding
could
participate
in
the
increased
cardiovascular
event
rate
after
statin
discontinuation
