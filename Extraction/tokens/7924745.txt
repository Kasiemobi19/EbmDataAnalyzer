Diagnostic
value
of
fasting
plasma
peptide
concentrations
in
patients
with
chronic
diarrhea
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
utility
of
screening
for
multiple
gastrointestinal
peptides
in
the
evaluation
of
patients
with
chronic
diarrhea
we
studied
193
patients
referred
for
evaluation
of
chronic
diarrhea
and
eight
patients
with
known
peptide-secreting
tumors
as
a
reference
group
Fasting
plasma
samples
were
assayed
for
motilin
neurotensin
pancreatic
polypeptide
somatostatin
substance
P
vasoactive
intestinal
polypeptide
gastrin-releasing
peptide
and
calcitonin
during
a
protocol
evaluation
for
causes
of
chronic
diarrhea
Although
none
of
the
referred
patients
were
found
to
have
tumors
abnormal
levels
of
one
or
more
peptides
were
found
in
86
of
193
patients
(45%)
Abnormal
plasma
peptide
levels
were
sometimes
as
high
in
these
patients
as
in
patients
with
known
peptide-secreting
tumors
and
would
have
led
to
mistaken
diagnoses
of
tumors
much
more
often
than
they
would
have
led
to
correct
diagnoses
The
positive
predictive
value
of
elevation
of
any
assayed
peptide
was
<
2%
at
realistic
prevalence
rates
for
peptide-secreting
tumors
the
negative
predictive
value
of
a
series
of
normal
results
was
>
99%
but
much
of
this
was
due
to
the
rarity
of
these
tumors
Patients
with
chronic
diarrhea
should
not
be
screened
routinely
with
a
panel
of
plasma
peptide
assays
in
an
effort
to
detect
tumors
instead
peptide
levels
should
be
ordered
selectively
Elevated
fasting
concentrations
of
the
plasma
peptides
measured
in
this
study
are
most
likely
epiphenomena
due
to
diarrhea
and
should
not
be
the
sole
basis
for
invasive
diagnostic
or
surgical
management
of
these
patients
