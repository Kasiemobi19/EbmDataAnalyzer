Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
effect
of
a
large
long
standing
and
intentional
weight
reduction
on
the
incidence
of
diabetes
hypertension
and
lipid
disturbances
in
severely
obese
individuals
as
compared
to
weight-stable
obese
controls
The
ongoing
prospective
SOS
(Swedish
Obese
Subjects)
intervention
consists
of
a
surgically
treated
group
and
a
matched
control
group
obtaining
conventional
obesity
treatment
This
report
is
based
on
845
surgically
treated
patients
and
845
controls
(BMI
410+/-46
kg/m2
(mean+/-standard
deviation
[S]))
followed
for
2
years
Surgically
treated
patients
lost
28+/-15
kg
and
controls
05+/-89
kg
(p<00001)
Two-year
incidence
of
hypertension
diabetes
hyperinsulinemia
and
lipid
disturbances
was
compared
in
the
two
treatment
groups
Adjusted
odds
ratios
(95%
CI)
for
the
surgically
treated
group
versus
controls
were
038
(022
065)
for
hypertension
002
(000
016)
for
diabetes
010
(003
028)
for
hyperinsulinemia
0
10
(004
025)
for
hypertriglyceridemia
028
(016
049)
for
low
HDL-cholesterol
and
124
(084
18)
for
hypercholesterolemia
Compared
to
controls
the
2-year
recovery
rates
from
hypertension
diabetes
hypo-HDL
and
hypertriglyceridemia
were
significantly
higher
in
the
surgically
treated
group
Intentional
weight
loss
in
the
obese
causes
a
marked
reduction
in
the
2-year
incidence
of
hypertension
diabetes
and
some
lipid
disturbances
The
results
suggest
that
severe
obesity
can
and
should
be
treated
