meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Contrast
nephropathy
is
associated
with
increased
in-hospital
morbidity
and
mortality
and
leads
to
extension
of
hospital
stay
in
patients
with
chronic
renal
insufficiency
Acetylcysteine
seems
to
be
a
safe
and
inexpensive
way
to
reduce
contrast
nephropathy
We
aimed
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
acetylcysteine
to
prevent
contrast
nephropathy
after
administration
of
radiocontrast
media
in
patients
with
chronic
renal
insufficiency
We
did
a
meta-analysis
of
randomised
controlled
trials
comparing
acetylcysteine
and
hydration
with
hydration
alone
for
preventing
contrast
nephropathy
in
patients
with
chronic
renal
insufficiency
The
trials
were
identified
through
a
combined
search
of
the
BIOSIS+/RRM
MEDLINE
Web
of

and
The
Cochrane

Databases
We
used
incidence
of
contrast
nephropathy
48
h
after
administration
of
radiocontrast
media
as
an
outcome
measure
Seven
trials
including
805
patients
were
eligible
according
to
our
inclusion
criteria
and
were
analysed
Overall
incidence
of
contrast
nephropathy
varied
between
8%
and
28%
Since
significant
heterogeneity
was
indicated
by
the
Q
statistics
(p=0016)
we
used
a
random-effects
model
to
combine
the
data
Compared
with
periprocedural
hydration
alone
administration
of
acetylcysteine
and
hydration
significantly
reduced
the
relative
risk
of
contrast
nephropathy
by
56%
(0435
[95%
CI
0215-0879]
p=002)
in
patients
with
chronic
renal
insufficiency
Meta-regression
revealed
no
significant
relation
between
the
relative
risk
of
contrast
nephropathy
and
the
volume
of
radiocontrast
media
administered
or
the
degree
of
chronic
renal
insufficiency
before
the
procedure
Compared
with
periprocedural
hydration
alone
acetylcysteine
with
hydration
significantly
reduces
the
risk
of
contrast
nephropathy
in
patients
with
chronic
renal
insufficiency
The
relative
risk
of
contrast
nephropathy
was
not
related
to
the
amount
of
radiocontrast
media
given
or
to
the
degree
of
chronic
renal
insufficiency
before
the
procedure
