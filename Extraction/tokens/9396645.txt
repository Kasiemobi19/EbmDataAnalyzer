Rhinitis
and
inhalant
allergens
Abstract
Text
Allergic
rhinitis
affects
about
20%
of
the
US
population
The
diagnosis
is
based
on
patterns
of
symptoms
physical
examination
and
assessment
of
IgE
antibodies
by
skin
or
in
vitro
testing
The
most
common
offending
allergens
are
pollens
of
grasses
trees
and
weeds
fungi
animal
allergens
and
dust
mites
In
an
individual
with
nasal
allergy
exposure
leads
to
rapid
release
of
mast
cell-derived
mediators
This
immediate
response
is
followed
by
a
cell-dominated
response
including
eosinophils
and
lymphocytes
Cytokines
from
T(H)2
lymphocytes
such
as
interleukin
4
and
interleukin
5
orchestrate
allergic
inflammation
Resulting
tissue
changes
produce
symptoms
of
the
disease
and
augment
responses
on
subsequent
exposure
to
allergens
and
irritants
Strategies
for
avoiding
offending
agents
are
important
in
management
In
intermittent
disease
antihistamines
and/or
decongestants
are
first
prescribed
More
continuous
symptoms
may
mandate
intranasal
steroids
Immunotherapy
is
often
helpful
for
patients
who
respond
poorly
to
pharmacotherapy
and
avoidance
