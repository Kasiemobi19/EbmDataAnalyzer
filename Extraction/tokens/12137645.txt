Title
Desmopressin
for
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
Abstract
Text
Enuresis
(bedwetting)
is
a
socially
disruptive
and
stressful
condition
which
affects
around
15-20%
of
five
year
olds
and
up
to
2%
of
young
adults
To
assess
the
effects
of
desmopressin
on
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
and
to
compare
desmopressin
with
other
interventions
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Incontinence
Group
trials
register
Date
of
the
most
recent
search
March
2002
The
reference
list
of
a
previous
version
of
this
review
was
also
searched
All
randomised
trials
of
desmopressin
for
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
were
included
in
the
review
Comparison
interventions
included
placebo
other
drugs
alarms
or
behavioural
methods
Trials
focused
solely
on
daytime
wetting
were
excluded
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
the
quality
of
the
eligible
trials
and
extracted
data
Forty
one
randomised
trials
involving
2760
children
(of
whom
1813
received
desmopressin)
met
the
inclusion
criteria
The
quality
of
many
of
the
trials
was
poor
Desmopressin
was
compared
with
another
drug
in
four
trials
and
with
alarms
in
seven
Desmopressin
was
effective
in
reducing
bedwetting
in
a
variety
of
doses
and
forms
Each
dose
of
desmopressin
reduced
bedwetting
by
at
least
one
night
per
week
during
treatment
compared
with
placebo
(eg
20
microg
134
fewer
wet
nights
per
week
95%
CI
111
to
157)
Children
on
desmopressin
were
more
likely
to
become
dry
(eg
RR
for
failure
to
achieve
14
dry
nights
with
20
mcg
084
95%
CI
079
to
091)
However
there
was
no
difference
after
treatment
was
finished
There
was
no
clear
dose-related
effect
of
desmopressin
but
the
evidence
was
limited
Data
which
compared
oral
and
nasal
administration
were
too
few
to
be
conclusive
While
desmopressin
was
better
than
diclofenac
or
indomethacin
and
comparison
with
tricyclic
drugs
(amitriptyline
and
imipramine)
suggested
that
they
might
be
as
effective
as
desmopressin
the
data
were
inconclusive
due
to
small
numbers
There
were
more
side
effects
with
the
tricyclics
In
one
small
trial
desmopressin
resulted
in
more
wet
nights
than
alarms
towards
the
end
of
treatment
(WMD
14
95%
CI
014
to
266)
and
the
chance
of
failure
or
relapse
after
alarms
was
less
(RR
917
95%
CI
128
to
6590)
Although
there
were
fewer
wet
nights
during
alarm
treatment
supplemented
by
desmopressin
compared
with
alarms
alone
(WMD
-135
95%
CI
-232
to
-038)
the
data
are
inconclusive
about
whether
this
is
reflected
in
lower
failure
(RR
088
95%CI
052
to
150)
or
subsequent
relapse
rates
(RR
058
95%
CI
031
to
110)
Desmopressin
rapidly
reduced
the
number
of
wet
nights
per
week
but
there
was
some
evidence
that
this
was
not
sustained
after
treatment
stopped
Comparison
with
alternative
treatments
suggested
that
desmopressin
and
tricyclics
had
similar
clinical
effects
but
that
alarms
may
produce
more
sustained
benefits
However
based
on
the
available
limited
evidence
these
conclusions
can
only
be
tentative
Children
should
be
advised
not
to
drink
more
than
240
ml
(8
oz)
fluid
during
desmopressin
treatment
in
order
to
avoid
the
possible
risk
of
water
intoxication
