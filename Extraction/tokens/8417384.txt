Title
Effects
of
tocopherol
and
deprenyl
on
the
progression
of
disability
in
early
Parkinson's
disease
The
Parkinson
Study
Group
Abstract
Text
In
1987
we
began
a
multicenter
controlled
clinical
trial
of
deprenyl
(a
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitor)
and
tocopherol
(a
component
of
vitamin
E
that
traps
free
radicals)
in
the
treatment
of
early
Parkinson's
disease
We
randomly
assigned
800
patients
to
one
of
four
treatments
placebo
active
tocopherol
and
deprenyl
placebo
active
deprenyl
and
tocopherol
placebo
or
both
active
drugs
The
primary
end
point
was
the
onset
of
disability
prompting
the
clinical
decision
to
begin
administering
levodopa
An
interim
analysis
showed
that
deprenyl
was
beneficial
(N
Engl
J
Med

We
report
the
results
of
tocopherol
treatment
after
a
mean
(+/-
SD)
follow-up
of
14
+/-
6
months
as
well
as
the
follow-up
results
for
deprenyl
There
was
no
beneficial
effect
of
tocopherol
or
any
interaction
between
tocopherol
and
deprenyl
The
beneficial
effects
of
deprenyl
which
occurred
largely
during
the
first
12
months
of
treatment
remained
strong
and
significantly
delayed
the
onset
of
disability
requiring
levodopa
therapy
(hazard
ratio
050
95
percent
confidence
interval
041
to
062
P
<
0001)
The
difference
in
the
estimated
median
time
to
the
end
point
was
about
nine
months
The
ratings
for
Parkinson's
disease
improved
during
the
first
three
months
of
deprenyl
treatment
the
motor
performance
of
deprenyl-treated
patients
worsened
after
the
treatments
were
withdrawn
Deprenyl
(10
mg
per
day)
but
not
tocopherol
(2000
IU
per
day)
delays
the
onset
of
disability
associated
with
early
otherwise
untreated
Parkinson's
disease
The
action
of
deprenyl
that
accounts
for
its
beneficial
effects
remains
unclear
