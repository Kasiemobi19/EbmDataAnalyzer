Title
Clinical
warning
criteria
in
evaluation
by
computed
tomography
the
secondary
neurological
headaches
in
adults
Abstract
Text
Our
aims
were
to
investigate
the
frequency
of
intracranial
lesions
detected
by
cranial
computed
tomography
(CT-scan)
amongst
adult
patients
who
had
clinical
warning
criteria
(CWC)
for
secondary
neurological
headaches
and
to
determine
the
importance
of
CWC
in
predicting
a
possible
lesion
on
CT-scan
Seventy
consecutive
patients
with
headache
exhibiting
CWC
were
included
in
this
prospective
study
The
CWC
included
(i)
increase
in
the
intensity
and
frequency
of
headache
(ii)
abrupt
onset
of
headache
(iii)
persistence
of
headache
despite
analgesics
(iv)
alteration
of
the
characteristics
of
headache
and
(v)
presence
of
focal
neurological
symptoms
or
findings
The
mean
age
of
the
patients
was
465
years
the
female-to-male
ratio
was
15
Of
the
patients
357%
had
a
neurological
cause
identified
by
CT-scan
and
643%
had
normal
CT-scan
In
the
patients
without
lesion
of
headaches
644%
were
primary
and
356%
were
from
undefined
headache
group
Although
of
the
above
criteria
only
the
5th
was
different
markedly
in
the
patients
with
lesion
than
the
patients
without
lesion
in
evaluation
by
CT-scan
the
secondary
neurological
headaches
in
adults
all
CWC
should
look
for
absolutely
in
their
history
and
physical
examination
