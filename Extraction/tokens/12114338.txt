A
6-month
placebo-controlled
study

lung
function

health
status
changes
in
COPD
patients
treated
with
tiotropium
or
salmeterol
Abstract
Text
Tiotropium
a
once-daily
anticholinergic
and
salmeterol
represent
two
inhaled
long-acting
bronchodilators
from
different
pharmacologic
classes
A
trial
was
designed
to
examine
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
both
compounds
with
multiple
outcome
measures
including
lung
function
dyspnea
and
health-related
quality
of
life
(HRQoL)
in
patients
with
COPD
A
6-month
randomized
placebo-controlled
double-blind
double-dummy
parallel-group
study
of
tiotropium
18
microg
once
daily
via
dry-powder
inhaler
compared
with
salmeterol
50
microg
bid
via
metered-dose
inhaler
was
conducted
in
patients
with
COPD
Efficacy
was
assessed
by
12-h
monitoring
of
spirometry
transition
dyspnea
index
(TDI)
and
the
St
George's
Respiratory
Questionnaire
(SGRQ)
A
total
of
623
patients
participated
(tiotropium
n=
209
salmeterol
n
=
213
and
placebo
n
=
201)
The
groups
were
similar
in
age
(mean
65
years)
gender
(75%
men)
and
baseline
FEV(1)
(mean
108
+/-
037
L
percent
predicted
40
+/-
12%
[+/-
SD])
Compared
with
placebo
treatment
the
mean
predose
morning
FEV(1)
following
6
months
of
therapy
increased
significantly
more
for
the
tiotropium
group
(014
L)
than
the
salmeterol
group
(009
L
p
<
001)
The
average
FEV(1)
(0
to
12
h)
for
tiotropium
was
statistically
superior
to
salmeterol
(difference
008
L
p
<
0001)
Tiotropium
improved
TDI
focal
score
by
102
U
compared
with
placebo
(p
=
001)
whereas
there
was
no
significant
change
in
TDI
focal
score
with
salmeterol
(024
U)
Tiotropium
was
superior
to
salmeterol
in
improving
TDI
focal
score
(p
<
005)
At
6
months
the
mean
improvement
in
SGRQ
total
score
vs
baseline
was
tiotropium
-
514
U
(p
<
005
vs
placebo)
salmeterol
-
354
U
(p
=
04
vs
placebo)
and
placebo
-
243
U
A
statistically
higher
proportion
of
patients
receiving
tiotropium
achieved
at
least
a
4-U
change
in
SGRQ
score
compared
to
patients
receiving
placebo
Both
active
drugs
reduced
the
need
for
rescue
albuterol
(p
<
00001)
Tiotropium
once
daily
produces
superior
bronchodilation
improvements
in
dyspnea
and
proportion
of
patients
achieving
meaningful
changes
in
HRQoL
compared
to
twice-daily
salmeterol
in
patients
with
COPD
