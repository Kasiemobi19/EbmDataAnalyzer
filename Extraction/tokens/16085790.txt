Subjective
memory
complaints
with
and
without
objective
memory
impairment
relationship
with
risk
factors

dementia
Abstract
Text
The
authors
investigated
the
frequency
distribution
of
well-established
risk
factors
for
dementia--high
plasma
homocysteine
and
the
apolipoprotein
E
epsilon4
allele
(APOE
epsilon4)--among
older
women
with
subjective
memory
complaints
(SMC)
but
no
cognitive
impairment
and
with
mild
cognitive
impairment
(MCI)
This
was
a
cross-sectional
community-based
study
Women
with
MCI
had
higher
total
plasma
homocysteine
than
healthy-comparison
subjects
There
was
also
a
nonsignificant
excess
of
APOE
epsilon4
carriers
in
the
MCI
than
in
the
healthy
group
Participants
with
SMC
had
higher
depression
and
anxiety
scores
than
healthy-comparison
subjects
but
did
not
differ
from
subjects
in
the
healthy-comparison
group
in
relation
to
their
total
plasma
homocysteine
and
APOE
epsilon4
distribution
MCI
seems
to
be
more
closely
related
to
well-established
risk
factors
for
dementia
than
is
SMC
