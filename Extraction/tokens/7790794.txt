Spinal
manipulation

amitriptyline
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
tension-type
headaches
a
randomized
clinical
trial
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
effectiveness
of
spinal
manipulation
and
pharmaceutical
treatment
(amitriptyline)
for
chronic
tension-type
headache
Randomized
controlled
trial
using
two
parallel
groups
The
study
consisted
of
a
2-wk
baseline
period
a
6-wk
treatment
period
and
a
4-wk
posttreatment
follow-up
period
Chiropractic
college
outpatient
clinic
One
hundred
and
fifty
patients
between
the
ages
of
18
and
70
with
a
diagnosis
of
tension-type
headaches
of
at
least
3
months'
duration
at
a
frequency
of
at
least
once
per
wk
6
wk
of
spinal
manipulative
therapy
provided
by
chiropractors
or
6
wk
of
amitriptyline
treatment
managed
by
a
medical
physician
Change
in
patient-reported
daily
headache
intensity
weekly
headache
frequency
over-the-counter
medication
usage
and
functional
health
status
(SF-36)
A
total
of
448
people
responded
to
the
recruitment
advertisements
298
were
excluded
during
the
screening
process
Of
the
150
patients
who
were
enrolled
in
the
study
24
(16%)
dropped
out
5
(66%)
from
the
spinal
manipulative
therapy
and
19
(271%)
from
the
amitriptyline
therapy
group
During
the
treatment
period
both
groups
improved
at
very
similar
rates
in
all
primary
outcomes
In
relation
to
baseline
values
at
4
wk
after
cessation
of
treatment
the
spinal
manipulation
group
showed
a
reduction
of
32%
in
headache
intensity
42%
in
headache
frequency
30%
in
over-the-counter
medication
usage
and
an
improvement
of
16%
in
functional
health
status
By
comparison
the
amitriptyline
therapy
group
showed
no
improvement
or
a
slight
worsening
from
baseline
values
in
the
same
four
major
outcome
measures
Controlling
for
baseline
differences
all
group
differences
at
4
wk
after
cessation
of
therapy
were
considered
to
be
clinically
important
and
were
statistically
significant
Of
the
patients
who
finished
the
study
46
(821%)
in
the
amitriptyline
therapy
group
reported
side
effects
that
included
drowsiness
dry
mouth
and
weight
gain
Three
patients
(43%)
in
the
spinal
manipulation
group
reported
neck
soreness
and
stiffness
The
results
of
this
study
show
that
spinal
manipulative
therapy
is
an
effective
treatment
for
tension
headaches
Amitriptyline
therapy
was
slightly
more
effective
in
reducing
pain
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
period
but
was
associated
with
more
side
effects
Four
weeks
after
the
cessation
of
treatment
however
the
patients
who
received
spinal
manipulative
therapy
experienced
a
sustained
therapeutic
benefit
in
all
major
outcomes
in
contrast
to
the
patients
that
received
amitriptyline
therapy
who
reverted
to
baseline
values
The
sustained
therapeutic
benefit
associated
with
spinal
manipulation
seemed
to
result
in
a
decreased
need
for
over-the-counter
medication
There
is
a
need
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
spinal
manipulative
therapy
beyond
four
weeks
and
to
compare
spinal
manipulative
therapy
to
an
appropriate
placebo
such
as
sham
manipulation
in
future
clinical
trials
