Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
accuracy
of
transvaginal
ultrasonography
sonohysterography
and
diagnostic
hysteroscopy
for
the
investigation
of
abnormal
uterine
bleeding
in
premenopausal
women
Systematic
review
of
common
diagnostic
imaging
tests
Relevant
papers
were
identified
through
electronic
searching
of
MEDLINE
(1980
to
July
2001)
and
EMBASE
(1980
to
July
2001)
and
manual
searching
of
a
bibliography
of
primary
and
review
articles
Studies
were
selected
if
accuracy
of
transvaginal
ultrasonography
sonohysterography
and
diagnostic
hysteroscopy
was
compared
with
a
reference
standard
and
included
data
that
could
be
abstracted
into
a
two-by-two
table
in
order
to
calculate
sensitivity
and
specificity
Quality
assessment
and
data
extraction
were
performed
by
at
least
two
independent
reviewers
Diagnostic
accuracy
was
determined
by
calculating
positive
and
negative
likelihood
ratios
for
all
intrauterine
pathologies
submucous
fibroids
and
endometrial
hyperplasia
Nineteen
studies
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Statistically
significant
heterogeneity
was
present
between
the
likelihood
ratios
for
studies
of
transvaginal
ultrasound
A
positive
test
result
with
sonohysterography
diagnosed
submucous
fibroids
with
a
pooled
likelihood
ratio
of
297
(178
496)
A
positive
test
result
with
hysteroscopy
diagnosed
submucous
fibroids
with
a
pooled
likelihood
ratio
of
294
(134
653)
and
any
intrauterine
pathology
with
a
pooled
likelihood
ratio
of
77
(43
137)
A
negative
test
result
with
hysteroscopy
for
diagnosing
any
intrauterine
pathology
had
a
pooled
likelihood
ratio
of
007
(004
015)
Although
there
was
considerable
variability
present
between
the
studies
all
three
diagnostic
tests
were
moderately
accurate
in
detecting
intrauterine
pathology
However
sonohysterography
and
hysteroscopy
performed
better
than
transvaginal
ultrasound
in
detecting
submucous
fibroids
