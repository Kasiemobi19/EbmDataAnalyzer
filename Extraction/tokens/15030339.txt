Cumulative
meta-analysis
of
systemic
antifungal
agents
for
the
treatment
of
onychomycosis
Abstract
Text
Onychomycosis
is
a
common
nail
disease
that
is
often
chronic
difficult
to
eradicate
and
has
a
tendency
to
recur
The
most
common
oral
therapies
for
dermatophyte
toenail
onychomycosis
include
terbinafine
itraconazole
and
fluconazole
A
cumulative
meta-analysis
of
the
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
for
antimycotic
agents
was
performed
to
determine
whether
the
pooled
estimate
of
the
cure
rates
has
remained
consistent
over
the
years
Furthermore
for
each
agent
we
compared
the
overall
meta-analytical
average
of
both
mycological
and
clinical
response
rates
of
RCTs
vs
open
studies
We
searched
MEDLINE
(1966
to
November
2002)
for
relevant
studies
evaluating
the
efficacy
of
the
oral
antifungal
agents
terbinafine
itraconazole
(pulse
or
continuous)
fluconazole
and
griseofulvin
for
treating
dermatophyte
toenail
onychomycosis
Studies
included
in
this
meta-analysis
required
a
standard
accepted
dosage
regimen
treatment
duration
and
follow-up
period
To
determine
the
cumulative
meta-analytical
average
studies
were
sequentially
pooled
by
adding
one
study
at
a
time
according
to
the
date
of
publication
(ie
earliest
to
the
most
recent)
There
were
36
studies
included
in
the
analyses
For
RCTs
the
change
in
efficacy
of
mycological
cure
rates
from
the
first
trial
to
the
overall
cumulative
meta-average
for
each
drug
comparator
is
as
follows
(with
95%
confidence
interval)
terbinafine
78
+/-
6%
(n
=
2
studies
79
patients)
to
76
+/-
3%
(n

(P

itraconazole

(n

20
patients)
to
63

7%
(n

patients)
(P

itraconazole
continuous
63
+/-

(n

patients)
to
59
+/-
5%
(n

patients)
(P

fluconazole
53
+/-
6%
(n

1
study
72
patients)
to
48
+/-
5%
(n
=
3
studies
131
patients)
(P
=
050)
and
griseofulvin
55
+/-
8%
(n
=
2
studies
109
patients)
to
60
+/-
6%
(n
=
3
studies
167
patients)
(P
=
041)
The
cumulative
meta-analytical
average
of
mycological
cure
rates
when
comparing
RCTs
vs
open
studies
was
terbinafine
76
+/-
3%
(n
=
18
studies
993
patients)
vs
83
+/-
12%
(n
=
2
studies
391
patients)
(P
=
00028)
itraconazole
pulse
63
+/-
7%
(n
=
6
studies
318
patients)
vs
84
+/-
9%
(n
=
3
studies
194
patients)
(P
=
00001)
and
fluconazole
48
+/-
5%
(n
=
3
studies
131
patients)
vs
79
+/-
3%
(n
=
3
studies
208
patients)
(P
=
00001)
The
cumulative
meta-analysis
of
cure
rates
for
RCTs
suggests
that
over
time
as
new
RCTs
have
been
conducted
the
efficacy
rates
have
remained
consistent
The
efficacy
rates
of
open
studies
are
substantially
higher
compared
with
RCTs
and
may
therefore
overestimate
cure
rates
