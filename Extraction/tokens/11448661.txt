Title
Treatment
of
chronic
headache
with
antidepressants
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Although
antidepressants
are
often
used
for
preventing
chronic
headache
their
effectiveness
is
uncertain
We
performed
a
meta-analysis
of
English-language
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
of
antidepressants
as
prophylaxis
for
chronic
headache
Thirty-eight
trials
were
included
Because
some
compared
more
than
one
drug
with
placebo
44
study
arms
were
combined
using
a
random
effects
model
Twenty-five
studies
focused
on
migraines
12
on
tension
headaches
and
1
on
both
Nineteen
used
tricyclic
antidepressants
18
serotonin
antagonists
and
7
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
Patients
receiving
antidepressants
were
twice
as
likely
to
report
headache
improvement
(rate
ratio
[RR]
20
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
16
to
24)
Because
31%
(95%
CI
23%
to
40%)
more
treated
patients
improved
than
those
receiving
placebo
clinicians
would
need
to
treat
32
patients
for
1
patient
to
improve
The
average
amount
of
improvement
(standardized
mean
difference)
was
094
(95%
CI
065
to
12)
an
effect
considered
large
Treated
patients
also
consumed
less
analgesic
medication
(standardized
mean
difference
-07
95%
CI
-05
to
-094)
There
were
no
differences
in
outcomes
among
the
three
classes
of
agents
studied
or
by
the
type
of
headache
(migraine
vs
tension)
quality
score
length
of
treatment
or
percentage
of
patients
lost
to
follow-up
Assessment
of
depression
across
studies
was
insufficient
to
determine
if
the
effects
were
independent
of
depression
Antidepressants
are
effective
in
preventing
chronic
headaches
Whether
this
is
independent
of
depression
and
whether
there
are
differences
in
efficacy
by
class
of
agent
needs
further
study
