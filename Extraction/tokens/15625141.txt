Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
effect
of
body
mass
index
(BMI)
and
weight
on
risk
of
pregnancy
while
using
oral
contraceptives
(OCs)
We
conducted
a
case-control
study
of
248
health
maintenance
organization
enrollees
who
became
pregnant
while
using
OCs
between
1998
and
2001
and
533
age-matched
enrollees
who
were
nonpregnant
OC
users
during
the
same
period
Using
logistic
regression
we
calculated
adjusted
odds
ratios
(ORs)
to
estimate
the
risk
of
pregnancy
according
to
BMI
and
weight
quartile
Among
all
OC
users
when
compared
with
women
having
a
BMI
of
273
or
less
the
risk
of
pregnancy
was
nearly
60%
higher
in
women
with
BMI
greater
than
273
(OR
158
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
111-224)
and
over
70%
higher
in
women
with
BMI
greater
than
322
(OR
172
95%
CI
104-282)
Among
consistent
users
(women
who
missed
no
pills
in
reference
month)
the
risk
of
pregnancy
was
more
than
doubled
in
women
with
BMI
greater
than
273
(OR
217
95%
CI
138-341)
or
BMI
greater
than
322
(OR
222
95%
CI
118-420)
When
compared
with
women
weighing
748
kg
or
less
among
consistent
OC
users
the
risk
of
pregnancy
was
over
70%
higher
in
women
weighing
more
than
748
kg
(OR
171
95%
CI
108-271)
and
nearly
doubled
in
women
weighing
more
than
862
kg
(OR
195
95%
CI
106-367)
Our
results
suggest
that
being
overweight
may
increase
the
risk
of
becoming
pregnant
while
using
OCs
If
causal
this
association
translates
to
an
additional
2-4
pregnancies
per
100
woman-years
of
use
among
overweight
women
for
whom
consideration
of
additional
or
effective
alternative
contraceptive
methods
may
be
warranted
