Faecal
metronidazole
concentrations
during
oral
and
intravenous
therapy
for
antibiotic
associated
colitis
due
to
Clostridium
difficile
Abstract
Text
Faecal
metronidazole
and
hydroxymetronidazole
concentrations
measured
by
high
pressure
liquid
chromatography
are
reported
during
10
episodes
of
Clostridium
difficile
colitis
in
nine
patients
Bactericidal
faecal
concentrations
were
present
in
all
patients
with
acute
disease
receiving
oral
or
intravenous
metronidazole
and
all
responded
to
therapy
Metronidazole
and
hydroxymetronidazole
concentrations
fell
as
the
diarrhoea
improved
and
neither
substance
was
detectable
in
the
faeces
of
five
patients
after
recovery
This
demonstration
of
intracolonic
therapeutic
concentrations
of
metronidazole
supports
the
clinical
experience
of
oral
metronidazole
being
effective
in
the
treatment
of
antibiotic
associated
diarrhoea
caused
by
C
difficile
and
also
suggests
a
potential
role
for
intravenous
metronidazole
in
this
disease
