The
influence
of
immediate
surgical
treatment
of
proximal
femoral
fractures
on
mortality
and
quality
of
life
Operation

the

six
hours
Abstract
Text
We
compared
the
mortality
and
outcome
of
182
patients
with
proximal
fractures
of
the
femur
after
immediate
and
delayed
surgical
treatment
Seventy-nine
patients
were
operated
upon
within
six
hours
of
the
fracture
(group
1)
and
103
patients
were
operated
upon
after
this
period
of
time
(group
2)
At
six
months
follow-up
group
1
had
a
significantly
lower
mortality
rate
There
was
a
good
outcome
in
both
groups
with
no
differences
in
the
outcome
Neither
surgical
nor
anaesthetic
factors
appeared
to
have
influenced
mortality
The
subdivision
of
groups
revealed
that
patients
operated
on
within
24
hours
had
a
better
outcome
than
those
whose
surgery
was
delayed
Although
there
may
have
been
a
bias
as
patients
were
not
randomly
assigned
to
immediate
or
delayed
surgical
treatment
the
data
suggest
that
early
stabilisation
may
be
associated
with
a
lower
mortality
rate
Even
with
pre-clinical
delays
of
more
than
six
hours
early
treatment
should
still
be
attempted
as
better
results
seem
to
be
achieved
after
24
hours
compared
to
a
later
time
in
our
patients
