Athletic

Heat
vs
cold
Abstract
Text
Cryotherapy
is
the
treatment
of
choice
in
the
management
of
acute
athletic
injuries
Ice
is
readily
available
and
simple
to
apply
The
rationale
for
its
use
is
based
on
well-defined
physiologic
observations
The
application
of
heat
is
not
indicated
in
the
immediate
treatment
of
acute
athletic
injuries
If
applied
early
and
injudiciously
heat
may
adversely
affect
resolution
of
the
trauma
and
prolong
the
rehabilitation
of
the
athlete
