Abstract
Text
Hypocalcemia
is
common
in
the
ICU
and
is
a
marker
of
poor
prognosis
The
mechanisms
behind
the
low
calcium
levels
include
extravasation
increased
chelation
intracellular
overload
of
calcium
and
an
altered
parathyroid
hormone
(PTH)
secretion
Hypocalcemia
and
an
altered
PTH
secretion
seem
to
be
related
to
systemic
inflammation
but
it
is
not
known
today
if
this
response
is
appropriate
or
not
Therefore
a
general
supplementation
with
calcium
in
these
patients
cannot
be
recommended
at
this
stage
