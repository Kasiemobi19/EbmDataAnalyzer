Abstract
Text
Improving
patients'
health-related
quality
of
life
(HRQOL)
could
be
a
treatment
goal
for
bipolar
depression
The
objectives
of
these
secondary
analyses
of
a
previous
report
were
to
determine
the
benefits
of
olanzapine
alone
and
olanzapine-fluoxetine
combination
(OFC)
for
improving
HRQOL
in
patients
with
bipolar
depression
using
both
a
generic
and
a
depression-specific
HRQOL
instrument
and
to
examine
the
association
between
the
2
HRQOL
instruments
and
the
construct
validity
of
the
depression-specific
HRQOL
instrument
This
was
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
83-site
international
randomized
trial
Adults
with
bipolar
I
disorder
most
recent
episode
depressed
(according
to
the
Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manual
of
Mental

Edition)
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
olanzapine
(6-20
mg/d)
OFC
(6/25
12/25
or
12/50
mg/d)
or
placebo
for
8
weeks
HRQOL

and

Changes
in
SF-36
scores
of
mental

social
functioning
role-emotional
and
vitality
were
highly
correlated
to
changes
in
the
QLDS
total
score
(all

Based
on
these
analyses
patients
with
bipolar
depression
receiving
olanzapine
or
OFC
for
8
weeks
had
greater
improvement
in
HRQOL
than
those
receiving
placebo
OFC
treatment
was
associated
with
greater
improvement
in
HRQOL
than
olanzapine
alone
The
correlation
results
support

construct
validity
of
the
QLDS
