Abstract
Text
The
Persantine
Aspirin
Trial
focused
on
the
question
of
whether
the
administration
of
the
combination
of
aspirin
and
dipyridamole
(Persantine)
would
result
in
a
lower
incidence
of
cerebral
or
retinal
infarction
or
death
than
the
administration
of
aspirin
alone
for
persons
with
a
history
of
recent
carotid
territory
transient
ischemic
attacks
(TIAs)
Fifteen
centers
in
the
United
States
and
Canada
participated
and
890
individuals
were
admitted
and
randomly
allocated
to
either
aspirin
(325
mg)
plus
placebo
or
aspirin
(325
mg)
plus
Persantine
(75
mg)
four
times
daily
Ninety
eight
percent
of
the
subjects
were
followed
for
at
least
one
year
many
were
followed
for
four
to
five
years
The
results
of
life
table
analysis
indicate
that
the
overall
endpoint
rates
for
the
"aspirin
only"
and
"aspirin
plus
Persantine"
groups
are
identical
Thus
for
TIA
patients
taking
aspirin
the
addition
of
Persantine
contributes
nothing
There
was
a
clustering
of
stroke
endpoints
during
the
first
month
after
randomization
Deaths
from
all
causes
were
essentially
equally
divided
between
the
two
treatment
groups
