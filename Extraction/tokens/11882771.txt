Evidence
for
the
optimal
management
of
acute
and
chronic
phantom
pain
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
The
objective
was
to
examine
the
evidence
to
determine
the
optimal
management
of
phantom
limb
pain
in
the
preoperative
and
postoperative
phase
of
amputations
Trials
were
identified
by
a
systematic
search
of
MEDLINE
review
articles
and
references
of
relevant
trials
from
the
period
1966-1999
including
only
English-language
articles
Included
trials
involved
a
control
group
any
intervention
and
reported
phantom
pain
as
an
outcome
Twelve
trials
were
identified
including
375
patients
whose
follow-ups
ranged
in
duration
from
1
week
to
2
years
Only
three
randomized
controlled
studies
with
parallel
groups
and
three
randomized
crossover
trials
were
identified
Eight
trials
examined
treatment
of
acute
phantom
pain
including
epidural
treatments
(three
trials)
regional
nerve
blocks
(three
trials)
treatment
with
calcitonin
(one
trial)
and
transcutaneous
electrical
nerve
stimulation
(one
trial)
Three
trials
demonstrated
a
positive
impact
of
the
intervention
on
phantom
limb
pain
but
the
remainder
demonstrated
no
difference
between
the
intervention
and
control
groups
Four
trials
examined
late
postoperative
interventions
including
transcutaneous
electrical
nerve
stimulation
(two
trials)
and
the
use
of
Farabloc
(a
metal
threaded
sock)
and
ketamine
(one
trial
each)
With
regard
to
late
postoperative
interventions
three
of
the
four
trials
showed
modest
short-term
reduction
of
phantom
limb
pain
There
was
no
relation
between
the
quality
of
the
trial
and
a
positive
result
of
the
intervention
Although
up
to
70%
of
patients
have
phantom
limb
pain
after
amputation
there
is
little
evidence
from
randomized
trials
to
guide
clinicians
with
treatment
Evidence
on
preemptive
epidurals
early
regional
nerve
blocks
and
mechanical
vibratory
stimulation
provides
inconsistent
support
for
these
treatments
There
is
currently
a
gap
between
research
and
practice
in
the
area
of
phantom
limb
pain
