The
value
of
colposcopy
in
screening
cervical
carcinoma
Abstract
Text
The
value
of
colposcopy
and
cytology
in
screening
CIN
was
analyzed
in
a
retrospective
study
of
1504
patients
treated
at
the
Department
of
Gynecologic
Oncology
National
Institute
of
Oncology
Budapest
from
1980
to
1991
The
majority
(1451)
of
the
patients
were
admitted
for
histological
confirmation
of
atypical
colposcopic
and/or
cytologic
findings
and
53
women
were
treated
for
cervical
repair
All
women
underwent
either
cervical
excision
or
conization
Cytologic
and
colposcopic
findings
were
compared
with
the
histological
results
Sensitivity
and
specificity
rates
of
cytology
were
47%
and
77%
respectively
The
corresponding
figures
for
colposcopy
were
87%
and
15%
and
for
cytology
and
colposcopy
together
96%
and
14%
The
low
sensitivity
of
cytology
suggests
that
as
many
as
50%
of
CIN
lesions
may
be
overlooked
if
cytology
alone
is
used
for
screening
ie
in
50%
of
CIN
associated
with
abnormal
colposcopy
the
cytology
was
negative
We
found
194
asymptomatic
patients
with
carcinoma
in
situ
40
with
microinvasive
and
8
with
frank
invasive
carcinoma
This
finding
emphasizes
the
importance
of
cervical
cancer
screening
Our
data
suggest
that
with
colposcopy
as
a
screening
tool
the
rate
of
false-negative
cytology
can
be
significantly
reduced
Clinical
implications
of
the
"cytology-negative
abnormal
colposcopy
and
cytology-negative
CIN"
have
yet
to
be
determined
The
major
drawback
of
primary
colposcopy
is
its
low
specificity
with
the
consequence
of
high
false-positive
rate
and
over-treatment
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
To
overcome
the
problem
of
low
specificity
further
studies
are
required
to
identify
those
atypical
colposcopic
changes
that
most
likely
represent
CIN--and
high-grade
CIN
in
particular
