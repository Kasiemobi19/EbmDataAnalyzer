Abstract
Text
Three
previous
reviews
have
reached
conflicting
conclusions
regarding
the
efficacy
of
antidepressants
for
patients
with
back
pain
To
systematically
review
the
efficacy
of
antidepressants
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
back
pain
and
to
determine
whether
there
is
evidence
that
outcomes
vary
between
classes
of
antidepressants
Best
evidence
synthesis
of
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
of
oral
antidepressive
agents
in
patients
with
back
pain
Studies
were
identified
by
searching
MEDLINE
PsycINFO
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Registry
Two
independent
reviewers
performed
data
extraction
and
assessed
included
studies
with
a
22-point
methodologic
quality
assessment
scale
Effect
sizes
were
calculated
if
sufficient
data
were
available
Twenty-two
trials
of
antidepressants
for
the
treatment
of
back
pain
were
identified
of
which
seven
studies
of
chronic
low
back
pain
met
inclusion
criteria
Among
studies
using
antidepressants
that
inhibit
norepinephrine
reuptake
(tricyclic
or
tetracyclic
antidepressants)
four
of
five
found
significant
improvement
in
at
least
one
relevant
outcome
measure
Assessment
of
these
agents'
impact
on
functional
measures
produced
mixed
results
No
benefit
in
pain
relief
or
functional
status
was
found
in
three
studies
of
antidepressants
that
do
not
inhibit
norepinephrine
reuptake
Based
on
a
small
number
of
studies
tricyclic
and
tetracyclic
antidepressants
appear
to
produce
moderate
symptom
reductions
for
patients
with
chronic
low
back
pain
This
benefit
appears
to
be
independent
of
depression
status
SSRIs
do
not
appear
to
be
beneficial
for
patients
with
chronic
low
back
pain
There
is
conflicting
evidence
whether
antidepressants
improve
functional
status
of
patients
with
chronic
low
back
pain
