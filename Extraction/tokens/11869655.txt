The
Epley
(canalith
repositioning)
manoeuvre
for
benign
paroxysmal
positional
vertigo
Abstract
Text
Benign
paroxysmal
positional
vertigo
(BPPV)
is
a
syndrome
characterised
by
short-lived
episodes
of
vertigo
in
association
with
rapid
changes
in
head
position
It
is
a
common
cause
of
vertigo
presenting
to
primary
care
and
specialist
otolaryngology
clinics
Current
treatment
approaches
include
rehabilitative
exercises
and
physical
manoeuvres
including
the
Epley
manoeuvre
To
assess
the
effectiveness
of
the
Epley
manoeuvre
compared
to
other
treatments
available
for
posterior
canal
benign
paroxysmal
positional
vertigo
or
no
treatment

Date

June

Randomised
trials
of
adults
diagnosed
with
posterior
canal
BPPV
(including
a
positive
Dix-Hallpike
test)
Comparisons
sought
-
Epley
manoeuvre
versus
placebo
-
Epley
manoeuvre
versus
untreated
controls
Epley
manoeuvre
versus
other
active
treatment
Outcome
measures
that
were
considered
include
frequency
and
severity
of
attacks
of
vertigo
proportion
of
patients
improved
by
each
intervention
and
conversion
of
a
"positive"
Dix-Hallpike
test
to
a
"negative"
Dix-Hallpike
test

Both
reviewers
independently
extracted
data
and
assessed
trials
for
quality
Eleven
trials
were
identified
but
nine
studies
were
excluded
because
of
a
high
risk
of
bias
leaving
two
trials
in
the
review
Trials
were
mainly
excluded
because
of
inadequate
concealment
during
randomisation
or
failure
to
blind
outcome
assessors
Both
studies
included
in
the
review
(Lynn
1995
Froehling
2000)
addressed
the
efficacy
of
the
Epley
manoeuvre
against
a
sham
manoeuvre
by
comparing
the
proportion
of
subjects
in
each
group
who
had
complete
resolution
of
their
symptoms
and
who
converted
from
a
positive
to
negative
Dix-Hallpike
test
Individual
and
pooled
data
showed
a
statistically
significant
effect
in
favour
of
the
Epley
manoeuvre
over
controls
There
were
no
serious
adverse
effects
of
treatment
~bullet~There
is
some
evidence
that
the
Epley
manoeuvre
is
a
safe
effective
treatment
for
posterior
canal
BPPV
although
this
is
based
on
the
results
of
only
two
small
randomised
controlled
trials
with
relatively
short
follow
up
~bullet~There
is
no
good
evidence
that
the
Epley
manoeuvre
provides
a
long
term
resolution
of
symptoms
~bullet~There
is
no
good
evidence
comparing
the
Epley
manoeuvre
with
other
physical
medical
or
surgical
therapy
for
posterior
canal
BPPV
