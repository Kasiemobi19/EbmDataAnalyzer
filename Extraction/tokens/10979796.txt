Title
Alendronate
for
the
treatment
of
osteoporosis
in
men
Abstract
Text
Despite
its
association
with
disability
death
and
increased
medical
costs
osteoporosis
in
men
has
been
relatively
neglected
as
a
subject
of
study
There
have
been
no
large
controlled
trials
of
treatment
in
men
In
a
two-year
double-blind
trial
we
studied
the
effect
of
10
mg
of
alendronate
or
placebo
given
daily
on
bone
mineral
density
in
241
men
(age
31
to
87
years
mean
63)
with
osteoporosis
Approximately
one
third
had
low
serum
free
testosterone
concentrations
at
base
line
the
rest
had
normal
concentrations
Men
with
other
secondary
causes
of
osteoporosis
were
excluded
All
the
men
received
calcium
and
vitamin
D
supplements
The
main
outcome
measures
were
the
percent
changes
in
lumbar-spine
hip
and
total-body
bone
mineral
density
The
men
who
received
alendronate
had
a
mean
(+/-SE)
increase
in
bone
mineral
density
of
71+/-03
percent
at
the
lumbar
spine
25+/-04
percent
at
the
femoral
neck
and
20+/-02
percent
for
the
total
body
(P<0001
for
all
comparisons
with
base
line)
In
contrast
men
who
received
placebo
had
an
increase
in
lumbar-spine
bone
mineral
density
of
18+/-05
percent
(P<0001
for
the
comparison
with
base
line)
and
no
significant
changes
in
femoral-neck
or
total-body
bone
mineral
density
The
increase
in
bone
mineral
density
in
the
alendronate
group
was
greater
than
that
in
the
placebo
group
at
all
measurement
sites
(P<0001)
The
incidence
of
vertebral
fractures
was
lower
in
the
alendronate
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
(08
percent
vs
71
percent
P=002)
Men
in
the
placebo
group
had
a
24-mm
decrease
in
height
as
compared
with
a
decrease
of
06
mm
in
the
alendronate
group
(P=002)
Alendronate
was
generally
well
tolerated
In
men
with
osteoporosis
alendronate
significantly
increases
spine
hip
and
total-body
bone
mineral
density
and
helps
prevent
vertebral
fractures
and
decreases
in
height
