Prevalence
of
chlamydial
and
gonococcal
infections
among
young
adults
in
the
United
States
Abstract
Text
Chlamydial
and
gonococcal
infections
are
important
causes
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
ectopic
pregnancy
and
infertility
Although
screening
for
Chlamydia
trachomatis
is
widely
recommended
among
young
adult
women
little
information
is
available
regarding
the
prevalence
of
chlamydial
and
gonococcal
infections
in
the
general
young
adult
population
To
determine
the
prevalence
of
chlamydial
and
gonococcal
infections
in
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
young
adults
living
in
the
United
States
Cross-sectional
analyses
of
a
prospective
cohort
study
of
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
14322
young
adults
aged
18
to
26
years
In-home
interviews
were
conducted
across
the
United
States
for
Wave
III
of
The
National
Longitudinal
Study
of
Adolescent
Health
(Add
Health)
from
April
2
2001
to
May
9
2002
This
study
sample
represented
663%
of
the
original
18924
participants
in
Wave
I
of
Add
Health
First-void
urine
specimens
using
ligase
chain
reaction
assay
were
available
for
12548
(876%)
of
the
Wave
III
participants
Prevalences
of
chlamydial
and
gonococcal
infections
in
the
general
young
adult
population
and
by
age
self-reported
race/ethnicity
and
geographic
region
of
current
residence
Overall
prevalence
of
chlamydial
infection
was
419%
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
348%-490%)
Women
(474%
95%
CI
393%-571%)
were
more
likely
to
be
infected
than
men
(367%

293%-458%

The
prevalence
of
chlamydial
infection
was
highest
among
black
women
(1395%
95%
CI
1125%-1718%)
and
black
men
(1112%
95%
CI
851%-1442%)
lowest
prevalences
were
among
Asian
men
(114%
95%
CI
040%-321%)
white
men
(138%
95%
CI
093%-203%)
and
white
women
(252%
95%
CI
190%-334%)
Prevalence
of
chlamydial
infection
was
highest
in
the
south
(539%
95%
CI
424%-683%)
and
lowest
in
the
northeast
(239%
95%
CI
156%-365%)
Overall
prevalence
of
gonorrhea
was
043%
(95%
CI
029%-063%)
Among
black
men
and
women
the
prevalence
was
213%
(95%
CI
146%-310%)
and
among
white
young
adults
010%
(95%
CI
003%-027%)
Prevalence
of
coinfection
with
both
chlamydial
and
gonococcal
infections
was
0030%
(95%
CI
018%-049%)
The
prevalence
of
chlamydial
infection
is
high
among
young
adults
in
the
United
States
Substantial
racial/ethnic
disparities
are
present
in
the
prevalence
of
both
chlamydial
and
gonococcal
infections
