Using
the
Berlin
Questionnaire
to
identify
patients
at
risk
for
the
sleep
apnea
syndrome
Abstract
Text
Although
sleep
apnea
is
common
it
often
goes
undiagnosed
in
primary
care
encounters
To
test
the
Berlin
Questionnaire
as
a
means
of
identifying
patients
with
sleep
apnea
Survey
followed
by
portable
unattended
sleep
studies
in
a
subset
of
patients
Five
primary
care
sites
in
Cleveland
Ohio
744
adults
(of
1008
surveyed
[74%])
of
whom
100
underwent
sleep
studies
Survey
items
addressed
the
presence
and
frequency
of
snoring
behavior
waketime
sleepiness
or
fatigue
and
history
of
obesity
or
hypertension
Patients
with
persistent
and
frequent
symptoms
in
any
two
of
these
three
domains
were
considered
to
be
at
high
risk
for
sleep
apnea
Portable
sleep
monitoring
was
conducted
to
measure
the
number
of
respiratory
events
per
hour
in
bed
(respiratory
disturbance
index
[RDI])
Questions
about
symptoms
demonstrated
internal
consistency
(Cronbach
correlations
086
to
092)
Of
the
744
respondents
279
(375%)
were
in
a
high-risk
group
that
was
defined
a
priori
For
the
100
patients
who
underwent
sleep
studies
risk
grouping
was
useful
in
prediction
of
the
RDI
For
example
being
in
the
high-risk
group
predicted
an
RDI
greater
than
5
with
a
sensitivity
of
086
a
specificity
of
077
a
positive
predictive
value
of
089
and
a
likelihood
ratio
of
379
The
Berlin
Questionnaire
provides
a
means
of
identifying
patients
who
are
likely
to
have
sleep
apnea
