Title
Universal
neonatal
hearing
screening
versus
selective
screening
as
part
of
the
management
of
childhood
deafness
Abstract
Text
The
principal
factors
that
decide
how
deafness
affects
a
child's
development
are
the
degree
of
hearing
impairment
and
the
age
at
which
it
is
diagnosed
A
number
of
factors
are
thought
to
increase
the
risk
of
hearing
impairment
low
birth
weight
prematurity
perinatal
hypoxia
and
jaundice
among
others
The
high
incidence
of
deafness
in
children
without
risk
factors
and
the
introduction
of
simple
new
screening
tests
of
high
sensitivity
and
specificity
has
led
many
prestigious
bodies
to
recommend
universal
early
detection
programmes
for
deafness
rather
than
screening
targeted
only
at
high-risk
groups
To
compare
the
long-term
effectiveness
of
a
universal
neonatal
screening
and
early
treatment
programme
for
hearing
impairment
with
a)
screening
and
treatment
only
of
high-risk
neonates
and
b)
opportunistic
screening
and
treatment
Databases
searched
were
MEDLINE
(1966
to
2003)
EMBASE
(1974
to
2003)
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
1
2004)
and
registers
of
health
technology
assessment
agencies
as
well
as
registers
of
clinical
guidelines
Randomised
controlled
trials
comparing
universal
neonatal
screening
with
either
high-risk
screening
or
opportunistic
screening
for
hearing
impairment
Two
review
authors
independently
screened
the
search
results
to
identify
suitable
trials
No
studies
were
identified
which
fulfilled
the
inclusion
criteria
The
long-term
effectiveness
of
universal
newborn
hearing
screening
programmes
has
not
been
established
to
date
There
is
a
need
for
controlled
trials
and
before
and
after
studies
to
address
this
issue
