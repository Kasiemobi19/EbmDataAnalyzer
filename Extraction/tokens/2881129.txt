Benefits
and
potential
harm
of
lowering
high
blood
pressure
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
whether
the
lower
the
blood
pressure
(BP)
the
better
the
prognosis
for
the
patient
with
moderate-to-severe
hypertension
an
assessment
was
made
of
902
patients
who
received
the
beta
1-selective
beta-blocker
atenolol
(median
dose
100
mg
a
day)
either
alone
or
with
other
antihypertensive
agents
for
up
to
10
years
(mean
61)
91
died
40
from
myocardial
infarction
21
from
stroke
and
30
from
other
causes
Initial
BP
was
a
poor
predictor
of
mortality
from
myocardial
infarction
whereas
treated
systolic
blood
pressure
(SBP)
was
a
strong
predictor
There
was
a
J-shaped
relation
confined
to
those
with
evidence
of
ischaemic
heart
disease
between
frequency
of
death
from
myocardial
infarction
and
treated
DBP
(phase
V)
the
frequency
was
lowest
at
treated
DBP
of
85-90
mm
Hg
and
rose
with
treated
DBP
on
either
side
of
this
range
