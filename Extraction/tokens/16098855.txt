In

type-specific
serologic
evidence
by
the
College
of

commercially
available
herpes
simplex
virus
antibody
assays
that
were
not
glycoprotein-G
based
demonstrated
high
false-positive
rates
(14%-88%)
for
herpes
simplex
virus
type-2
antibodies
in
sera
that
were
positive
for
herpes
simplex
virus
type-1
antibodies
but
negative
for
herpes
simplex
virus
type-2
antibodies
Herpes
simplex
virus
serologic
testing
should
be
performed
with
only
glycoprotein-G-based
tests
