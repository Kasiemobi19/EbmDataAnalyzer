Abstract
Text
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
demographic
clinical
and
microbiologic
findings
in
women
with
subclinical
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(PID)
and
women
with
acute
PID
A
cross-sectional
study
was
performed
using
cohorts
from
2
separate
studies
of
1293
women
at
risk
for
PID
Most
participants
were
recruited
from
emergency
departments
sexually
transmitted
disease
clinics
and
family
planning
clinics
in
metropolitan
centers
We
compared
demographic
clinical
and
microbiologic
findings
among
women
with
acute
PID
women
with
subclinical
PID
and
women
without
endometritis
(controls)
Statistical
analyses
included
chi-square
for
categorical
variables
calculation
of
odds
ratio
and
95%
confidence
intervals
and
polychotomous
logistic
regression
when
appropriate
Similar
proportions
of
women
with
acute
and
subclinical
PID
tested
positive
for
cervical
Chlamydia
trachomatis
(odds
ratio
[OR]
11
95%
confidence
interval
06-20)
and
had
bacterial
vaginosis
(OR
07
95%
CI
02-18)
The
rate
of
cervical
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
infection
in
women
with
subclinical
PID
was
intermediate
between
the
rates
in
women
with
acute
PID
and
controls
(21%
vs
49%
vs
7%
respectively
P
<0001
test
for
trend)
Endometrial
recovery
of
N
gonorrhoeae
and
C
trachomatis
in
women
with
subclinical
PID
was
also
seen
at
intermediate
levels
Similar
distributions
of
teenagers
women
who
smoked
or
used
illicit
drugs
and
women
engaging
in
sexual
intercourse
during
menses
were
found
in
each
group
Proportions
of
women
with
subclinical
PID
who
were
black
and
with
lower
education
levels
were
intermediate
between
the
proportions
of
these
characteristics
in
women
with
acute
PID
and
controls
Demographic
and
microbiologic
characteristics
of
women
with
subclinical
and
acute
PID
are
comparable
These
findings
suggest
that
the
pathophysiological
mechanisms
of
acute
and
subclinical
PID
are
similar
