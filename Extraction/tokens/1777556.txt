Prevalence

Abstract
Text
An
original
radioimmunoassay
for
quantitation
of
circulating
autoantibodies
(aAb)
to
thyroperoxidase
(TPO)
proved
to
be
well
suited
for
large
scale
routine
testing
The
present
study
was
aimed
to
assess
the
prevalence
of
aAb
to
TPO
in
patients
with
various
thyroid
and
autoimmune
disease
and
for
comparison
in
women
referred
for
reproductive
disorders
and
indication
of
in
vitro
fertilization
Anti-TPO
aAb
were
measured
in
sera
from
32
healthy
subjects
and
262
patients
thoroughly
investigated
for
thyroid
dysfunction
As
determined
in
healthy
subjects
the
normal
level
of
aAb
to
TPO
in
serum
ranged
from
030
to
307
mg/l
(of
affinity-purified)
anti-TPO
aAb
Anti-TPO
and
anti-MIC
aAb
levels
were
both
normal
in
115
patients
and
correlated
well
(r
=
0835
P
less
than
0001)
in
the
remaining
147
patients
Coexistence
of
normal
level
of
anti-TPO
aAb
and
abnormal
level
of
anti-MIC
aAb
was
found
in
4
patients
and
ascribed
to
a
lack
of
specificity
or
sensitivity
of
the
test
for
anti-MIC
aAb
Coexistence
of
abnormal
level
of
anti-TPO
aAb
and
normal
level
of
anti-MIC
aAb
was
found
in
67
patients
of
whom
62
presented
only
slightly
elevated
(31
to
100
mg/l)
anti-TPO
aAb
concentration
the
5
remaining
patients
all
with
overt
thyroid
autoimmune
disease
showed
anti-TPO
levels
between
107
to
1007
mg/l(ABSTRACT
