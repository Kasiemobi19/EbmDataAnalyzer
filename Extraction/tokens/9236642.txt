Abstract
Text
To
study
the
effects
of
antenatal
perineal
massage
on
subsequent
perineal
outcomes
at
delivery
A
randomised
single-blind
prospective
study
Department
of
Obstetrics
and
Gynaecology
Watford
General
Hospital
Eight
hundred
and
sixty-one
nulliparous
women
with
singleton
pregnancy
and
fulfilling
criteria
for
entry
to
the
trial
between
June
1994
and
October
1995
Comparison
of
the
group
assigned
to
massage
with
the
group
assigned
to
no
massage
showed
a
reduction
of
61%
in
second
or
third
degree
tears
or
episiotomies
This
corresponded
to
tear
rates
of
751%
in
the
no-massage
group
and
690%
in
the
massage
group
(P
=
0073)
There
was
a
corresponding
reduction
in
instrumental
deliveries
from
409%
to
346%
(P
=
0094)
After
adjustment
for
mother's
age
and
infant's
birthweight
these
reductions
achieved
statistical
significance
(P
=
0024
and
P
=
0034
respectively)
Analysis
by
mother's
age
showed
a
much
larger
benefit
due
to
massage
in
those
aged
30
and
over
and
a
smaller
benefit
in
those
under
30
Antenatal
perineal
massage
appears
to
have
some
benefit
in
reducing
second
or
third
degree
tears
or
episiotomies
and
instrumental
deliveries
This
effect
was
stronger
in
the
age
group
30
years
and
above
