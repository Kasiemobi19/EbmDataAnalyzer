Abstract
Text
Iron
supplements
are
often
prescribed
during
infancy
but
their
benefits
and
risks
have
not
been
well
documented
We
examined
whether
iron
supplements
affect
growth
or
morbidity
of
breast-fed
infants
Full-term
infants
in
Sweden
(n
=
101)
and
Honduras
(n
=
131)
were
randomly
assigned
to
three
groups
at
4
mo
of
age
1)
placebo
from
4
to
9
mo
2)
placebo
from
4
to
6
mo
and
iron
supplements
[1
mg/(kg
d)]
from
6
to
9
mo
or
3)
iron
supplements
from
4
to
9
mo
All
infants
were
exclusively
or
nearly
exclusively
breast-fed
to
6
mo
and
continued
to
be
breast-fed
to
at
least
9
mo
Growth
was
measured
monthly
and
morbidity
data
were
collected
every
2
wk
Among
the
Swedish
infants
gains
in
length
and
head
circumference
were
significantly
lower
in
those
who
received
iron
than
in
those
given
placebo
from
4
to
9
mo
The
same
effect
on
length
was
seen
in
Honduras
but
only
at
4-6
mo
among
those
with
initial
hemoglobin
(Hb)
>
or
=110
g/L
There
was
no
significant
main
effect
of
iron
supplementation
on
morbidity
nor
any
significant
interaction
between
iron
supplementation
and
site
but
for
diarrhea
(with
both
sites
combined)
there
was
an
interaction
between
iron
supplementation
and
initial
Hb
Among
infants
with
Hb
<
110
g/L
at
4
mo
diarrhea
was
less
common
among
those
given
iron
than
in
those
given
placebo
from
4-9
mo
whereas
the
opposite
was
true
among
those
with
Hb
>
or
=
110
g/L
(P
<
005)
We
conclude
that
routine
iron
supplementation
of
breast-fed
infants
may
benefit
those
with
low
Hb
but
may
present
risks
for
those
with
normal
Hb
