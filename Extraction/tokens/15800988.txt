external
kneading-like
force
on
the
abdomen
for
treatment
of
constipation
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
a
recently
developed
device
that
applies
kneading-like
motion
on
the
abdomen
in
improving
constipation
in
elderly
long-term
care
patients
Thirty
constipated
elderly
patients
were
randomly
selected
from
two
nursing
homes
They
were
instructed
to
use
the
device
once
daily
for
20
min
Rate
of
bowel
movements
volume
and
consistency
of
stool
and
the
use
of
laxantia
were
all
recorded
during
a
3-wk
baseline
period
and
for
12-wk
treatment
period
Colonic
transit
time
(CTT)
was
measured
in
13
patients
by
radiopaque
markers
during
the
baseline
and
at
the
end
of
treatment
Bowel
movement
rate
(BM/week)
increased
from
14+/-04
BM/wk
during
baseline
to
39+/-08
BM/wk
during
treatment
(P<50x10(-7))
Stool
amount
that
was
"low"
in
30
patients
during
baseline
increased
in
21
patients
at
the
end
of
the
study
period
(chi2
=
19048-P
=
13x10(-5))
Stool
consistency
that
was
"hard"
in
25
patients
and
"soft"
in
5
patients
during
baseline
ameliorated
in
23
patients
at
the
end
of
the
study
(only
2
patients
referred
"hard"
stool)
(chi2
=
21043-P
=
40x10(-6))
The
mean
baseline
CTT
measured
was
923+/-323
h
at
baseline
and
decreased
to
494+/-313
h
during
the
study
period
(P
=
0000208)
No
side
effects
were
observed
during
the
study
period
External
mechanical
vibration
of
the
abdomen
reduced
CTT
and
helped
to
relieve
severe
constipation
in
elderly
constipated
patients
