Increased
methylphenidate
usage
for
attention
deficit
disorder
in
the
1990s
Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
increased
use
and
the
prevalence
of
methylphenidate
(Ritalin)
treatment
of
youth
with
attention
deficit
disorder
(ADD)
during
the
1990s
Using
time-trend
findings
from
two
large
population-based
data
sources
three
pharmaceutical
databases
and
one
physician
audit
a
best-fit
estimate
of
the
usage
and
the
usage
trends
for
methylphenidate
treatment
over
the
half
decade
from
1990
through
1995
was
sought
Five
regions
in
the
United
States
(US)
and
the
nation
as
a
whole
Youths
on
record
as
receiving
methylphenidate
for
ADD
The
findings
from
regional
and
national
databases
indicate
that
on
average
there
has
been
a
25-fold
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
methylphenidate
treatment
of
youths
with
ADD
between
1990
and
1995
In
all
approximately
28%
(or
15
million)
of
US
youths
aged
5
to
18
were
receiving
this
medication
in
mid-1995
The
increase
in
methylphenidate
treatment
for
ADD
appears
largely
related
to
an
increased
duration
of
treatment
more
girls
adolescents
and
inattentive
youths
on
the
medication
and
a
recently
improved
public
image
of
this
medication
treatment
The
database
findings
presented
serve
to
correct
exaggerated
media
claims
of
a
6-fold
expansion
of
methylphenidate
treatment
although
they
do
not
clarify
the
issue
of
the
appropriateness
of
this
treatment
