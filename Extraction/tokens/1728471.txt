Joint

and
HDL

concentrations
on
coronary

Abstract
Text
We
studied
the
joint
effect
of
baseline
triglyceride
and
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
on
the
incidence
of
cardiac
end
points
in
the
trial
group
(n
=
4081)
of
the
Helsinki
Heart
Study
a
5-year
randomized
coronary
primary
prevention
trial
among
dyslipidemic
middle-aged
men
The
relative
risks
(RR)
were
calculated
using
Cox
proportional
hazards
models
with
a
dummy
variable
technique
that
allows
simultaneous
study
of
subgroup
combinations
from
the
placebo
and
treatment
groups
In
the
placebo
group
(n
=
2045)
the
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C)/high
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
ratio
was
the
best
single
predictor
of
cardiac
events
This
ratio
in
combination
with
the
serum
triglyceride
level
revealed
a
high-risk
subgroup
subjects
with
LDL-C/HDL-C
ratio
greater
than
5
and
triglycerides
greater
than
23
mmol/l
had
a
RR
of
38
(95%
CI
22-66)
compared
with
those
with
LDL-C/HDL-C
ratio
less
than
or
equal
to
5
and
triglyceride
concentration
less
than
or
equal
to
23
mmol/l
In
subjects
with
triglyceride
concentration
greater
than
23
mmol/l
and
LDL-C/HDL-C
ratio
less
than
or
equal
to
5
RR
was
close
to
unity
(11)
whereas
in
those
with
triglyceride
level
less
than
or
equal
to
23
mmol/l
and
LDL-C/HDL-C
ratio
greater
than
5
RR
was
12
The
high-risk
group
with
LDL-C/HDL-C
ratio
greater
than
5
and
triglyceride
level
greater
than
23
mmol/l
profited
most
from
treatment
with
gemfibrozil
with
a
71%
lower
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
events
than
the
corresponding
placebo
subgroup
In
all
other
subgroups
the
reduction
in
CHD
incidence
was
substantially
smaller
Serum
triglyceride
concentration
has
prognostic
value
both
for
assessing
coronary
heart
disease
risk
and
in
predicting
the
effect
of
gemfibrozil
treatment
especially
when
used
in
combination
with
HDL-C
and
LDL-C
