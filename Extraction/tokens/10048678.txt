outpatient
pediatric

a
multicenter
study
in

United
States
Abstract
Text
Few
data
have
been
published
recently
on
the
etiology
of
outpatient
pediatric
diarrhea
in
the
US
We
determined
the
etiology
of
acute
nondysenteric
diarrhea
among
147
children
between
2
and
11
years
old
presenting
to
9
outpatient
clinics
in
various
regions
of
the
US
between
August
1991
and
August
1993
Enteropathogens
were
sought
by
conventional
laboratory
methods
The
various
diarrheagenic
Escherichia
coli
were
sought
A
recognized
etiologic
agent
was
detected
in
the
stools
of
89
(605%)
children
and
15
(10)
patients
had
multiple
agents
detected
Rotavirus
was
found
in
43
(293%)
of
the
children
with
a
spring
and
winter
peak
in
occurrence
Giardia
lamblia
was
identified
in
22
(15%)
cases
with
a
spring
peak
HEp-2
cell-adherent
E
coli
were
found
in
15
(102%)
Other
agents
found
included
enteric
adenovirus
in
7
(48%)
Salmonella
in
5
(34%)
enterohemorrhagic
E
coli
in
5
(34%)
enteropathogenic
E
coli
in
2
(14%)
enterotoxigenic
E
coli
in
2
(14%)
Entamoeba
histolytica
in
1
(070%)
and
Campylobacter
jejuni
in
1
(07%)
In
addition
to
the
presence
of
conventional
enteropathogens
diarrheagenic
E
coli
(HEp-2
cell-adherent
E
coli
enterohemorrhagic
E
coli
enteropathogenic
E
coli
and
enterotoxigenic
E
coli)
were
associated
with
endemic
pediatric
diarrhea
in
the
US
