Minimum
incidence
and
diagnostic
rate
of
first
urinary
tract
infection
Abstract
Text
To
study
awareness
of
urinary
tract
infections
(UTIs)
by
determining
the
diagnostic
rate
of
first
UTI
in
children
<2
years
of
age
and
to
estimate
the
minimum
incidence
Twenty-six
of
a
total
of
43
pediatric
centers
participated
in
the
study
Sixty-four
percent
of
the
total
childhood
population
<2
years
of
age
was
covered
The
number
of
all
children
included
in
the
study
was
used
to
calculate
the
diagnostic
rate
Only
UTI
confirmed
by
either
suprapubic
aspiration
(any
growth)
or
midstream
or
bag
samples
with
>/=100
000
bacteria/mL
together
with
a
positive
nitrite
reaction
was
used
to
estimate
the
minimum
incidence
The
mean
diagnostic
rate
was
15%
for
boys
(range
07%-30%)
and
17%
for
girls
(range
07%-29%)
The
diagnostic
rate
was
significantly
higher
in
June
than
in
December
The
mean
incidence
was
10%
for
both
boys
and
girls
(range
03%-30%
and
04%-29%
respectively)
The
minimum
cumulative
incidence
at
2
years
of
age
was
estimated
to
be
22%
for
boys
and
21%
for
girls
This
study
suggests
a
high
UTI
awareness
in
Sweden
as
indicated
by
a
higher
diagnostic
rate
and
despite
stricter
diagnostic
criteria
a
higher
incidence
of
UTI
in
children
<2
years
of
age
than
previously
reported
It
is
suggested
that
a
high
UTI
awareness
may
reduce
chronic
renal
failure
because
of
pyelonephritic
renal
scarring
