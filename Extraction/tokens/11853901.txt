Abstract
Text
To
summarise
the
current
evidence
from
randomised
controlled
trials
for
diuretics
in
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
(CHF)
English-language

and

REVIEW
METHOD

Meta-analysis
of
randomised
controlled
trials
of
diuretic
therapy
in
patients
with
CHF
Studies
were
included
if
they
were
randomised
comparisons
of
loop
or
thiazide
diuretics
and
control
or
one
diuretic
and
another
active
agent
(eg
ACE
inhibitors
ibopamine
and
digoxin)
Using
a
standardised
protocol
two
reviewers
independently
abstracted
the
data
and
assessed
the
methodological
quality
of
each
paper
The
odds
ratio
(OR)
of
treated
group
compared
with
control
was
estimated
for
each
end-point
outcome
and
plotted
against
each
other
using
the
fixed-effects
model
THE
MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
The
primary
outcomes
of
our
analysis
were
effects
of
diuretics
on
mortality
and
morbidity
Eighteen
trials
met
our
criteria
and
were
eligible
for
analysis
involving
928
patients
Eight
trials
were
placebo-controlled
We
analysed
the
data
for
mortality
and
for
worsening
heart
failure
A
further
ten
trials
compared
diuretics
against
other
agents
such
as
ACE
inhibitors
ibopamine
and
digoxin
Mortality
data
were
available
in
three
of
the
placebo-controlled
trials
(n=221)
the
mortality
rate
was
lower
for
patients
treated
with
diuretics
than
for
control
[the
odds
ratio
for
death

95%

007-084
P=003]
Admissions
for
worsening
heart
failure
in
the
four
small
trials
(n=448)
showed
an
odds
ratio
of
031
(95%
CI
015-062
P=0001)
In
six
studies
of
diuretics
compared
to
active
control
diuretics
significantly
improved
exercise
capacity
in
patients
with
CHF
[OR
037
CI
010-064
P=0007]
Compared
to
active
control
diuretics
appear
to
reduce
the
risk
of
worsening
disease
and
improve
exercise
capacity
The
available
data
from
small
studies
show
that
in
CHF
conventional
diuretics
reduce
the
risk
of
death
and
worsening
heart
failure
compared
to
placebo
