Title
Outcomes
of
a
multicentre
randomised
clinical
trial
of
etanercept
to
treat
ankylosing
spondylitis
Abstract
Text
A
double
blind
randomised
placebo
controlled
study
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
etanercept
to
treat
adult
patients
with
ankylosing
spondylitis
(AS)
Adult
patients
with
AS
at
14
European
sites
were
randomly
assigned
to
25
mg
injections
of
etanercept
or
placebo
twice
weekly
for
12
weeks
The
primary
efficacy
end
point
was
an
improvement
of
at
least
20%
in
patient
reported
symptoms
based
on
the
multicomponent
Assessments
in
Ankylosing
Spondylitis
(ASAS)
response
criteria
(ASAS
20)
Secondary
end
points
included
ASAS
50
and
ASAS
70
responses
and
improved
scores
on
individual
components
of
ASAS
the
Bath
Ankylosing
Spondylitis
Disease
Activity
Index
(BASDAI)
acute
phase
reactants
and
spinal
mobility
tests
Safety
was
evaluated
during
scheduled
visits
Of
84
patients
enrolled
45
received
etanercept
and
39
received
placebo
Significantly
more
etanercept
patients
than
placebo
patients
responded
at
the
ASAS
20
level
as
early
as
week
2
and
sustained
differences
were
evident
up
to
week
12
Significantly
more
etanercept
patients
reported
ASAS
50
responses
at
all
times
and
ASAS
70
responses
at
weeks
2
4
and
8
reported
lower
composite
and
fatigue
BASDAI
scores
had
lower
acute
phase
reactant
levels
and
had
improved
spinal
flexion
Etanercept
was
well
tolerated
Most
adverse
events
were
mild
to
moderate
the
only
between-group
difference
was
injection
site
reactions
which
occurred
significantly
more
often
in
etanercept
patients
Etanercept
is
a
well
tolerated
and
effective
treatment
for
reducing
clinical
symptoms
and
signs
of
AS
