childhood-onset

some

its
amelioration
Abstract
Text
To
describe
new
data
on
the
incidence
and
impact
of
childhood-
and
adolescent-onset
bipolar
illness
and
make
recommendations
to
help
accelerate
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
in
this
area
Two
large
multicenter
out-patient
studies
in
adults
with
DSM-IV
bipolar
disorder-the
Systematic
Treatment
Enhancement
Program
for
Bipolar
Disorder
and
the
Bipolar
Collaborative
Network-were
the
primary
sources
of
retrospective
data
on
age
at
onset
We
focused
on
the
2
retrospective
studies
because
they
supplied
more
immediate
data
on
age
at
onset
and
long-term
prognosis
than
current
prospective
studies
The
2
studies
revealed
that
15%
to
28%
of
adults
experienced
an
onset
of
their
illness
prior
to
age
13
years
Those
with
childhood
versus
adult
onset
had
a
more
severe
complicated
and
adverse
course
of
bipolar
illness
assessed
retrospectively
and
confirmed
prospectively
during
naturalistic
treatment
The
time
lag
from
onset
of
first
symptoms
to
first
treatment
was
strongly
inversely
related
to
age
at
onset
and
averaged
168
+/-
10
years
in
those
with
childhood
onset
Recommendations
include
defining
temporary
consensus
threshold
criteria
for
each
bipolar
subtype
and
their
prodromes
conducting
studies
using
less
onerous
than
traditional
designs
including
randomized
open
comparisons
to
acquire
preliminary
data
in
this
age
cohort
and
forming
clinical
and
academic
treatment
outcome
networks
to
more
quickly
acquire
treatment
outcome
data
in
this
understudied
population
The
data
reveal
a
very
substantial
rate
of
childhood-onset
bipolar
illness
extraordinary
delays
in
onset
to
first
treatment
and
a
very
adverse
long-term
outcome
Several
approaches
to
accelerating
the
rate
of
acquisition
of
treatment
outcome
data
in
this
cohort
are
outlined
