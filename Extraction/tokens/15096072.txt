Citalopram
and
bupropion-SR
combining
versus
switching
in
patients
with
treatment-resistant
depression
Abstract
Text
There
are
limited
data
comparing
medication
strategies
in
patients
with
treatment-resistant
depression
In
this
study
we
compared
the
effects
of
combining
citalopram
and
bupropion-SR
versus
switching
to
the
other
monotherapy
in
treatment-resistant
depression
This
was
a
naturalistic
open-label
cohort
study
Patients
with
DSM-IV
major
depressive
disorder
who
had
not
responded
to
at
least
1
previous
antidepressant
and
at
least
6
weeks
of
treatment
with
citalopram
or
bupropion-SR
were
treated
in
a
standard
clinical
protocol
In
alternate
months
eligible
consecutive
patients
were
treated
by
adding
citalopram
or
bupropion-SR
or
by
switching
to
the
other
medication
Patients
were
assessed
at
baseline
and
after
6
weeks
of
treatment
with
the
29-item
version
of
the
Structured
Interview
Guide
for
the
Hamilton
Depression
Rating
Scale
Seasonal
Affective
Disorders
Version
(SIGH-SAD)
A
total
of
61
patients
completed
the
study
32
in
the
combination
condition
and
29
in
the
monotherapy
switch
condition
The
combination
condition
was
superior
to
the
monotherapy
switch
in
the
SIGH-SAD
change
score
(-148
vs
-101
respectively
p
<04)
and
the
proportion
of
patients
in
clinical
remission
(28%
vs
7%
p
<05)
There
were
no
differences
in
the
proportion
of
patients
who
had
side
effects
or
in
the
severity
of
the
side
effects
experienced
The
results
of
this
cohort
study
suggest
that
combining
citalopram
and
bupropion-SR
is
more
effective
than
switching
to
a
monotherapy
Combination
treatment
was
well
tolerated
with
no
greater
side
effect
burden
than
monotherapy
Limitations
of
this
study
include
the
nonrandomized
design
open-label
treatment
and
small
sample
size
