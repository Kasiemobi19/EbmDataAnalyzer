Abstract
Text
To
establish
whether
treatment
with
diuretic
or
beta
blocker
in
hypertensive
older
adults
reduces
risk
of
stroke
coronary
heart
disease
and
death
Randomised
placebo
controlled
single
blind
trial
226
general
practices
in
the
MRC
general
practice
research
framework
4396
patients
aged
65-74
randomised
to
receive
diuretic
beta
blocker
or
placebo
Patients
had
mean
systolic
pressures
of
160-209
mm
Hg
and
mean
diastolic
pressures
less
than
115
mm
Hg
during
an
eight
week
run
in
and
were
not
taking
antihypertensive
treatment
Patients
were
randomised
to
atenolol
50
mg
daily
hydrochlorothiazide
25
mg
or
50
mg
plus
amiloride
25
mg
or
5
mg
daily
or
placebo
The
regimens
were
adjusted
to
achieve
specified
target
pressures
Mean
follow
up
was
58
years
Strokes
coronary
events
and
deaths
from
all
causes
Both
treatments
reduced
blood
pressure
below
the
level
in
the
placebo
group
Compared
with
the
placebo
group
actively
treated
subjects
(diuretic
and
beta
blocker
groups
combined)
had
a
25%
(95%
confidence
interval
3%
to
42%)
reduction
in
stroke
(p
=
004)
19%
(-2%
to
36%)
reduction
in
coronary
events
(p
=
008)
and
17%
(2%
to
29%)
reduction
in
all
cardiovascular
events
(p
=
003)
After
adjusting
for
baseline
characteristics
the
diuretic
group
had
significantly
reduced
risks
of
stroke
(31%
(3%
to
51%)
p
=
004)
coronary
events
(44%
(21%
to
60%)
p
=
00009)
and
all
cardiovascular
events
(35%
(17%
to
49%)
p
=
00005)
compared
with
the
placebo
group
The
beta
blocker
group
showed
no
significant
reductions
in
these
end
points
The
reduction
in
strokes
was
mainly
in
non-smokers
taking
the
diuretic
Hydrochlorothiazide
and
amiloride
reduce
the
risk
of
stroke
coronary
events
and
all
cardiovascular
events
in
older
hypertensive
adults
