Early
detection
of
undiagnosed
diabetes
mellitus
a
US
perspective
Abstract
Text
Undiagnosed
Type
2
diabetes
has
become
a
common
condition
in
the
US
comprising
one-third
of
all
cases
of
the
disease
We
believe
that
screening
for
and
detection
of
undiagnosed
Type
2
diabetes
is
an
important
endeavor
In
this
review
we
provide
evidence
that
diabetes
is
a
condition
that
is
appropriate
for
population
screening
and
detection
This
includes
evidence
that
1
Type
2
diabetes
is
a
significant
health
problem
It
affects
more
than
16
million
adults
in
the
US
and
places
these
individuals
at
high
risk
for
serious
complications
of
the
eyes
nerves
kidneys
and
cardiovascular
system
2
There
is
a
latent
phase
before
diagnosis
of
Type
2
diabetes
During
this
period
of
undiagnosed
disease
risk
factors
for
diabetic
micro-
and
macrovascular
complications
are
markedly
elevated
and
diabetic
complications
are
developing
3
Diagnostic
criteria
for
diabetes
have
been
established
and
are
based
on
plasma
glucose
values
These
criteria
define
a
group
of
individuals
with
significant
hyperglycemia
who
also
have
a
high
frequency
of
risk
factors
for
micro-
and
macrovascular
disease
4
The
natural
history
of
Type
2
diabetes
is
understood
In
most
patients
diabetes
proceeds
inexorably
from
genetic
predisposition
through
the
stage
of
insulin
resistance
and
hyperinsulinemia
to
beta
cell
failure
and
overt
clinical
disease
5
There
are
effective
and
acceptable
therapies
available
for
Type
2
diabetes
and
its
complications
Treating
hyperglycemia
to
prevent
complications
is
more
effective
than
treating
these
complications
after
they
have
developed
Furthermore
guidelines
for
treatment
to
prevent
cardiovascular
disease
in
people
known
to
have
diabetes
are
more
stringent
than
in
those
individuals
who
are
not
known
to
have
diabetes
6
There
is
a
suitable
test
for
screening
for
undiagnosed
Type
2
diabetes
that
has
high
sensitivity
and
specificity
-
measurement
of
fasting
plasma
glucose
Guidelines
for
identifying
persons
at
high
risk
for
diabetes
have
been
established
