Abstract
Text
In
order
to
determine
antibody
levels
against
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
(pneumococcus)
and
Haemophilus
influenzae
type
b
(Hib)
in
a
population
of
splenectomized
subjects
561
persons
in
a
Danish
county
splenectomized
between
1984
and
1993
were
identified
Two
hundred
and
thirty-five
were
alive
and
149
participated
in
the
study
Each
person
donated
a
blood
sample
for
antibody
determination
by
ELISA
Though
vaccine
coverage
among
the
149
persons
was
91%
only
52%
had
'protective'
levels
of
pneumococcal
antibodies
Despite
recommendations
for
regular
follow-up
on
pneumococcal
antibody
levels
this
had
only
been
carried
out
in
4%
of
the
subjects
Splenectomized
subjects
who
needed
pneumococcal
revaccination
were
significantly
more
likely
to
have
received
their
initial
vaccination
less
than
14
days
before
or
after
splenectomy
as
recommended
than
those
not
requiring
revaccination
Therefore
the
timing
of
initial
pneumococcal
vaccination
in
relation
to
splenectomy
seems
to
be
important
All
persons
had
Hib
antibody
levels
higher
than
015
microgram/ml
and
60%
had
levels
higher
than
1
microgram/ml
which
are
the
levels
thought
to
provide
short
term
and
long
term
protection
respectively
In
total
37%
of
the
149
persons
tested
had
pneumococcal
and
Hib
antibody
levels
thought
to
correlate
with
protection
from
serious
infections
