Postmenopausal

scientific

Abstract
Text
Although
postmenopausal
hormone
replacement
therapy
(HRT)
is
widely
used
in
the
United
States
new
evidence
about
its
benefits
and
harms
requires
reconsideration
of
its
use
for
the
primary
prevention
of
chronic
conditions
To
assess
the
benefits
and
harms
of
HRT
for
the
primary
prevention
of
cardiovascular
disease
thromboembolism
osteoporosis
cancer
dementia
and
cholecystitis
by
reviewing
the
literature
conducting
meta-analyses
and
calculating
outcome
rates
All
relevant
English-language
studies
were
identified
in
MEDLINE
(1966-2001)
HealthSTAR
(1975-2001)
Cochrane
Library
databases
and
reference
lists
of
key
articles
Recent
results
of
the
Women's
Health
Initiative
(WHI)
and
the
Heart
and
Estrogen/progestin
Replacement
Study
(HERS)
are
included
for
reported
outcomes
We
used
all
published
studies
of
HRT
if
they
contained
a
comparison
group
of
HRT
nonusers
and
reported
data
relating
to
HRT
use
and
clinical
outcomes
of
interest
Studies
were
excluded
if
the
population
was
selected
according
to
prior
events
or
presence
of
conditions
associated
with
higher
risks
for
targeted
outcomes
Meta-analyses
of
observational
studies
indicated
summary
relative
risks
(RRs)
for
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
incidence
and
mortality
that
were
significantly
reduced
among
current
HRT
users
only
although
risk
for
incidence
was
not
reduced
when
only
studies
that
controlled
for
socioeconomic
status
were
included
The
WHI
reported
increased
CHD
events
(hazard
ratio
[HR]
129
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
102-163)
Stroke
incidence
but
not
mortality
was
significantly
increased
among
HRT
users
in
the
meta-analysis
and
the
WHI
The
meta-analysis
indicated
that
risk
was
significantly
elevated
for
thromboembolic
stroke
(RR
120
95%
CI
101-140)
but
not
subarachnoid
or
intracerebral
stroke
Risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
among
current
HRT
users
was
increased
overall
(RR
214
95%
CI
164-281)
and
was
highest
during
the
first
year
of
use
(RR
349
95%
CI
233-559)
according
to
a
meta-analysis
of
12
studies
Protection
against
osteoporotic
fractures
is
supported
by
a
meta-analysis
of
22
estrogen
trials
cohort
studies
results
of
the
WHI
and
trials
with
bone
density
outcomes
Current
estrogen
users
have
an
increased
risk
of
breast
cancer
that
increases
with
duration
of
use
Endometrial
cancer
incidence
but
not
mortality
is
increased
with
unopposed
estrogen
use
but
not
with
estrogen
with
progestin
A
meta-analysis
of
18
observational
studies
showed
a
20%
reduction
in
colon
cancer
incidence
among
women
who
had
ever
used
HRT
(RR
080
95%
CI
074-086)
a
finding
supported
by
the
WHI
Women
symptomatic
from
menopause
had
improvement
in
certain
aspects
of
cognition
Current
studies
of
estrogen
and
dementia
are
not
definitive
In
a
cohort
study
current
HRT
users
had
an
age-adjusted
RR
for
cholecystitis
of
18
(95%
CI
16-20)
increasing
to
25
(95%
CI
20-29)
after
5
years
of
use
Benefits
of
HRT
include
prevention
of
osteoporotic
fractures
and
colorectal
cancer
while
prevention
of
dementia
is
uncertain
Harms
include
CHD
stroke
thromboembolic
events
breast
cancer
with
5
or
more
years
of
use
and
cholecystitis
