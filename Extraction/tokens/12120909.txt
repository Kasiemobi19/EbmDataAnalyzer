Comparison
of
open

release
and
local
steroid
treatment
outcomes
in
idiopathic
carpal

syndrome
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
efficacy
of
local
steroid
injection
and
open
carpal
tunnel
release
a
symptom
and
functional
status
questionnaire
(Boston
Questionnaire)
and
sensory
and
motor
nerve
conduction
studies
were
performed
in
90
patients
with
electrophysiologically
proven
idiopathic
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
of
whom
44
were
treated
surgically
and
46
by
two-dose
steroid
injection
Electrophysiologic
studies
and
the
Boston
Questionnaire
were
applied
before
and
at
the
3rd
and
6th
months
after
treatment
Both
groups
showed
significant
improvement
at
first
follow-up
The
surgically
treated
group
showed
a
significant
and
further
improvement
of
symptoms
and
conduction
values
between
the
3rd-
and
6th-month
evaluations
whereas
no
significant
change
was
observed
in
the
patient
group
treated
by
steroid
injection
By
the
end
of
follow-up
5%
of
the
hands
in
the
open
carpal
tunnel
release
(OCTR)
group
and
13%
of
the
hands
in
the
local
steroid
injection
(LSIG)
group
showed
electrophysiological
worsening
and
5%
of
the
hands
in
the
OCTR
group
and
22%
of
the
hands
in
the
LSIG
group
showed
symptomatic
worsening
Our
results
show
that
steroid
injection
provides
an
improvement
comparable
with
that
from
surgical
release
of
the
median
nerve
at
a
3-month
interval
However
this
improvement
is
not
long-lasting
