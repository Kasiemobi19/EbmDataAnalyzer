Ventricular
arrhythmias
and
risk
of
death
and
acute
myocardial
infarction
in
apparently
healthy
subjects
of
age
>or=55
years
Abstract
Text
Increased
ventricular
ectopic
activity
and
even
more
complex
arrhythmias
are
not
uncommon
in
subjects
without
apparent
heart
disease
However
their
prognostic
significance
has
been
controversial
and
not
updated
in
recent
years
The
prevalence
and
prognostic
significance
of
different
ventricular
arrhythmias
were
studied
in
a
cohort
of
middle-aged
and
elderly
subjects
without
apparent
heart
disease
Six
hundred
seventy-eight
men
and
women
aged
55
to
75
years
without
a
history
of
heart
disease
or
stroke
were
included
Baseline
examinations
included
physical
examinations
fasting
laboratory
testing
and
48-hour
ambulatory
electrocardiographic
monitoring
All
patients
were
followed
for
up
to
5
years
Combined
events
were
defined
as
all-cause
mortality
or
acute
myocardial
infarction
A
cardiovascular
event
was
defined
as
cardiovascular
death
or
acute
myocardial
infarction
In
total
84%
had
0
to
10
ventricular
premature
complexes
(VPCs)/hour
8%
had
11
to
30
VPCs/hour
and
8%
had
>30
VPCs/hour
108%
had
>or=1
run
of
>or=3
VPCs
Frequent
VPCs
(>or=30/hour)
was
a
significant
predictor
of
combined
(hazard
ratio
247
95%
confidence
interval
129
to
468
p
=
0006)
and
cardiovascular
(hazard
ratio
285
95%
confidence
interval
116
to
70
p
=
0023)
event
rates
after
adjustment
for
conventional
risk
factors
Runs
of
>or=4
VPCs/day
or
>or=2
doublets/day
were
also
associated
with
a
poor
prognosis
but
only
in
the
presence
of
frequent
VPCs
The
detection
of
a
single
VPC
on
standard
electrocardiography
was
a
significant
predictor
of
frequent
VPCs
and
an
independent
predictor
of
events
(hazard
ratio
26
95%
confidence
interval
102
to
666
p
=
0045)
In
conclusion
apparently
healthy
middle-aged
and
elderly
subjects
with
frequent
VPCs
(>or=30/hour)
have
a
poor
prognosis
According
to
current
guidelines
strict
risk-factor
modification
and
primary
prevention
are
justified
in
these
high-risk
subjects
