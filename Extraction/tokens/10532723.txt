Title
Medical
treatment
of
pediatric
subperiosteal
orbital
abscess
secondary
to
sinusitis
Abstract
Text
Subperiosteal
abscess
may
accompany
orbital
cellulitis
secondary
to
sinusitis
Common
surgical
principles
include
incision
and
drainage
of
all
abscesses
Previous
evidence
suggests
that
some
orbital
abscesses
may
be
treatable
with
intravenous
antibiotics
especially
in
young
children
Children's
hospital
records
were
reviewed
to
determine
which
abscesses
may
be
treated
medically
Records
of
patients
admitted
for
orbital
cellulitis
from
1993
to
1996
were
reviewed
Patients
with
subperiosteal
abscess
on
CT
scan
were
included
Clinical
outcomes
for
initial
surgical
versus
medical
management
of
medial
abscesses
were
compared
Differences
in
age
hospital
stay
and
intracranial
involvement
were
analyzed
for
medial
versus
nonmedial
abscesses
All
patients
had
abscesses
adjacent
to
infected
sinuses
Eighteen
young
children
had
medial
abscesses
Twelve
of
13
were
cured
by
initial
medical
treatment
4
of
5
underwent
successful
initial
drainage
Outcomes
were
not
statistically
different
(P
>
490)
Seven
children
with
nonmedial
abscesses
were
older
(P
<
001)
and
had
more
complicated
courses
than
those
with
medial
abscess
Three
of
6
children
with
superior
orbital
abscess
also
had
intracranial
abscess
Intracranial
complication
was
more
likely
with
superior
versus
medial
orbital
abscess
(P
<
01)
Medial
subperiosteal
orbital
abscesses
secondary
to
sinusitis
in
children
6
years
of
age
and
younger
are
highly
amenable
to
treatment
with
intravenous
antibiotics
Older
children
and
children
with
nonmedial
abscesses
may
have
more
complicated
infections
Children
with
superior
orbital
abscesses
are
at
higher
risk
for
intracranial
abscess
