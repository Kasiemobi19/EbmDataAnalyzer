Abstract
Text
The
prevalence
of
thyroid
disease
and
the
concentration
of
thyroid
hormones
and
thyrotropin
were
studied
in
a
random
population
sample
of
1154
women
aged
50-72
years
with
special
reference
to
the
effect
of
age
and
smoking
The
prevalence
of
spontaneous
hypothyroidism
was
33%
(previously
unknown
overt
and
mild
disease
13%)
and
the
prevalence
of
hyperthyroidism
was
25%
(previously
unknown
disease
02%)
Clinically
suspected
hyper-
or
hypothyroidism
(very
weak
to
strong)
was
recorded
in
288
women
but
was
only
verified
in
three
cases
The
prevalence
of
visible
and
palpable
thyroid
enlargement
was
21%
and
13-14%
respectively
Total
thyroxine
concentrations
increased
and
free
tri-iodothyronine
levels
decreased
significantly
with
age
(P
less
than
0001)
The
serum
thyrotropin
concentrations
were
lower
in
smoking
women
than
in
non-smokers
in
the
50-
and
58-year
age
groups
(P
less
than
005)
There
was
no
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
thyroid
disease
or
goitre
in
the
women
who
were
smokers
at
the
time
of
the
study
