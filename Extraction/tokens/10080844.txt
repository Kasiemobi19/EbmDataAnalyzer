Title
Symptomatic
gastroesophageal
reflux
as
a
risk
factor
for
esophageal
adenocarcinoma
Abstract
Text
The
causes
of
adenocarcinomas
of
the
esophagus
and
gastric
cardia
are
poorly
understood
We
conducted
an
epidemiologic
investigation
of
the
possible
association
between
gastroesophageal
reflux
and
these
tumors
We
performed
a
nationwide
population-based
case-control
study
in
Sweden
Case
ascertainment
was
rapid
and
all
cases
were
classified
uniformly
Information
on
the
subjects'
history
of
gastroesophageal
reflux
was
collected
in
personal
interviews
The
odds
ratios
were
calculated
by
logistic
regression
with
multivariate
adjustment
for
potentially
confounding
variables
Of
the
patients
interviewed
the
189
with
esophageal
adenocarcinoma
and
the
262
with
adenocarcinoma
of
the
cardia
constituted
85
percent
of
the
529
patients
in
Sweden
who
were
eligible
for
the
study
during
the
period
from
1995
through
1997
For
comparison
we
interviewed
820
control
subjects
from
the
general
population
and
167
patients
with
esophageal
squamous-cell
carcinoma
Among
persons
with
recurrent
symptoms
of
reflux
as
compared
with
persons
without
such
symptoms
the
odds
ratios
were
77
(95
percent
confidence
interval
53
to
114)
for
esophageal
adenocarcinoma
and
20
(95
percent
confidence
interval
14
to
29)
for
adenocarcinoma
of
the
cardia
The
more
frequent
more
severe
and
longer-lasting
the
symptoms
of
reflux
the
greater
the
risk
Among
persons
with
long-standing
and
severe
symptoms
of
reflux
the
odds
ratios
were
435
(95
percent
confidence
interval
183
to
1035)
for
esophageal
adenocarcinoma
and
44
(95
percent
confidence
interval
17
to
110)
for
adenocarcinoma
of
the
cardia
The
risk
of
esophageal
squamous-cell
carcinoma
was
not
associated
with
reflux
(odds
ratio
11
95
percent
confidence
interval
07
to
19)
There
is
a
strong
and
probably
causal
relation
between
gastroesophageal
reflux
and
esophageal
adenocarcinoma
The
relation
between
reflux
and
adenocarcinoma
of
the
gastric
cardia
is
relatively
weak
