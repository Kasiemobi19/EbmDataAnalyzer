Pharmacokinetics
of
three
newer
quinolones
in
pregnant
and
lactating
women
Abstract
Text
Sixty
pregnant
women
with
fetuses
affected
by
beta-thalassemia
major
underwent
termination
of
gestation
induced
by
amniocentesis
and
intrauterine
instillation
of
prostaglandin
F2
alpha
between
19
and
25
weeks
Pharmacokinetics
of
ciprofloxacin
in
maternal
blood
and
amniotic
fluid
were
studied
after
two
doses
of
ciprofloxacin
(200
mg
intravenously
every
12
hours)
after
two
doses
of
pefloxacin
(400
mg
intravenously
every
12
hours)
and
after
two
doses
of
ofloxacin
(400
mg
intravenously
every
12
hours)
Twenty
patients
were
studied
in
each
group
The
ranges
of
mean
maternal
serum
and
amniotic
fluid
levels
were
as
follows
ciprofloxacin
in
maternal
serum
001
to
028
micrograms/ml
in
amniotic
fluid
01
to
013
micrograms/ml
pefloxacin
in
maternal
serum
265
to
431
micrograms/ml
in
amniotic
fluid
197
to
274
micrograms/ml
and
ofloxacin
in
maternal
serum
007
to
068
micrograms/ml
in
amniotic
fluid
013
to
025
micrograms/ml
Three
groups
of
lactating
women
(10
women
in
each)
were
given
three
doses
of
750
mg
ciprofloxacin
orally
400
mg
pefloxacin
orally
and
400
mg
ofloxacin
orally
Serum
and
milk
samples
were
obtained
simultaneously
at
two
four
six
nine
12
and
24
hours
after
dosage
administration
The
mean
breast
milk
levels
of
ciprofloxacin
at
the
corresponding
time
intervals
were
379
226
086
051
020
and
002
micrograms/ml
The
mean
breast
milk
levels
of
pefloxacin
were
354
343
293
224
179
and
088
micrograms/ml
and
of
ofloxacin
241
191
125
064
029
and
005
micrograms/ml
It
is
concluded
that
all
studied
quinolones
penetrate
the
placenta
and
are
found
in
amniotic
fluid
at
low
concentrations
and
at
much
higher
levels
in
breast
milk
Because
of
the
potential
for
quinolones
to
cause
arthropathy
in
juvenile
animals
their
use
should
be
avoided
in
pregnant
and
lactating
women
