Surgeons
gastroenterologists
endocrinologists
psychiatrists
nutritionists
and
other
health
care
professionals
as
well
as
members
of
the
public
convened
to
address
nonsurgical
treatments
for
severe
obesity
surgical
treatments
for
severe
obesity
and
criteria
for
selection
the
efficacy
and
risks
of
surgical
treatments
for
severe
obesity
and
the
need
for
future
research
on
and
epidemiologic
evaluation
of
these
therapies
The
National
Institutes
of
Health
Consensus
Development
Panel
recommended
that
patients
seeking
therapy
for
severe
obesity
for
the
first
time
should
be
considered
for
treatment
in
a
nonsurgical
program
that
integrates
a
dietary
regimen
appropriate
exercise
behavior
modification
and
psychological
support
that
gastric
restrictive
or
bypass
procedures
could
be
considered
for
well-informed
and
motivated
patients
in
whom
the
operative
risks
were
acceptable
that
patients
who
are
candidates
for
surgical
procedures
should
be
selected
carefully
after
evaluation
by
a
multidisciplinary
team
with
medical
surgical
psychiatric
and
nutritional
expertise
that
surgery
be
done
by
a
surgeon
who
has
substantial
experience
in
the
particular
procedure
and
who
works
in
a
clinical
setting
with
adequate
support
for
all
aspects
of
management
and
assessment
and
that
patients
undergo
lifelong
medical
surveillance
after
surgery
