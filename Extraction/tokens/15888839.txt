Bed
rest
or
ambulation
in
the
initial
treatment
of
patients
with
acute
deep
vein
thrombosis
or
pulmonary
embolism
findings
from
the
RIETE
registry
Abstract
Text
Traditionally
many
patients
with
acute
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
are
treated
not
only
by
anticoagulation
therapy
but
additionally
by
strict
bed
rest
which
is
aimed
at
reducing
the
risk
of
pulmonary
embolism
(PE)
events
However
this
risk
has
not
been
subjected
to
empirical
verification
The
Registro
Informatizado
de
la
Enfermedad
TromboEmb√≥lica
is
a
Spanish
registry
of
consecutively
enrolled
patients
with
objectively
confirmed
symptomatic
acute
DVT
or
PE
In
this
analysis
the
clinical
characteristics
details
of
anticoagulant
therapy
and
clinical
outcomes
of
enrolled
patients
with
and
without
strict
bed
rest
prescribed
during
the
first
15
days
were
compared
Patients
in
whom
ambulation
was
not
possible
were
not
included
in
this
analysis
A
total
of
2650
patients
entered
the
study
(DVT
2038
patients
PE
612
patients)
Of
these
patients
1050
DVT
patients
(52%)
and
385
PE
patients
(63%)
were
prescribed
strict
bed
rest
New
events
of
symptomatic
objectively
confirmed
PE
developed
during
the
15-day
study
period
in
11
patients
with
DVT
(05%)
and
4
patients
with
PE
(07%)
Five
of
these
15
patients
(33%)
died
as
a
result
of
their
PE
Age

65
years
(odds

and
cancer
(OR

95%

were
associated
with
an
increased
rate
of
new
PEs
There
were
not
significant
differences
between
bedridden
and
ambulant
patients
in
terms
of
new
PE
events
fatal
PE
or
bleeding
complications
Our
findings
confirm
those
from
previous
reports
suggesting
that
bed
rest
has
no
influence
on
the
risk
of
developing
PE
among
patients
with
acute
DVT
of
the
lower
limbs
In
addition
our
findings
show
for
the
first
time
the
lack
of
influence
of
bed
rest
even
in
patients
presenting
with
acute
submassive
PE
