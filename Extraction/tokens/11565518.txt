Effects
of
losartan
on
renal
and
cardiovascular
outcomes
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
and
nephropathy
Abstract
Text
Diabetic
nephropathy
is
the
leading
cause
of
end-stage
renal
disease
Interruption
of
the
renin-angiotensin
system
slows
the
progression
of
renal
disease
in
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
but
similar
data
are
not
available
for
patients
with
type
2
the
most
common
form
of
diabetes
We
assessed
the
role
of
the
angiotensin-II-receptor
antagonist
losartan
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
and
nephropathy
A
total
of
1513
patients
were
enrolled
in
this
randomized
double-blind
study
comparing
losartan
(50
to
100
mg
once
daily)
with
placebo
both
taken
in
addition
to
conventional
antihypertensive
treatment
(calcium-channel
antagonists
diuretics
alpha-blockers
beta-blockers
and
centrally
acting
agents)
for
a
mean
of
34
years
The
primary
outcome
was
the
composite
of
a
doubling
of
the
base-line
serum
creatinine
concentration
end-stage
renal
disease
or
death
Secondary
end
points
included
a
composite
of
morbidity
and
mortality
from
cardiovascular
causes
proteinuria
and
the
rate
of
progression
of
renal
disease
A
total
of
327
patients
in
the
losartan
group
reached
the
primary
end
point
as
compared
with
359
in
the
placebo
group
(risk
reduction
16
percent
P=002)
Losartan
reduced
the
incidence
of
a
doubling
of
the
serum
creatinine
concentration
(risk
reduction
25
percent
P=0006)
and
end-stage
renal
disease
(risk
reduction
28
percent
P=0002)
but
had
no
effect
on
the
rate
of
death
The
benefit
exceeded
that
attributable
to
changes
in
blood
pressure
The
composite
of
morbidity
and
mortality
from
cardiovascular
causes
was
similar
in
the
two
groups
although
the
rate
of
first
hospitalization
for
heart
failure
was
significantly
lower
with
losartan
(risk
reduction
32
percent
P=0005)
The
level
of
proteinuria
declined
by
35
percent
with
losartan
(P<0001
for
the
comparison
with
placebo)
Losartan
conferred
significant
renal
benefits
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
and
nephropathy
and
it
was
generally
well
tolerated
