Abstract
Text
Magnesium
is
an
important
constituent
of
the
intracellular
space
that
affects
a
number
of
intracellular
and
whole
body
functions
Magnesium
balance
depends
on
intake
and
renal
excretion
which
is
regulated
mainly
in
the
thick
ascending
limb
of
the
loop
of
Henle
The
complex
hormonal
modulation
that
responds
to
changes
in
plasma
concentration
of
other
ions
such
as
calcium
and
potassium
is
lacking
for
magnesium
As
a
result
negative
magnesium
balance
results
in
a
prompt
decrease
in
plasma
magnesium
concentration
and
hypermagnesemia
accompanies
renal
failure
with
magnesium
accumulation
Hypomagnesemia
may
result
from
gastrointestinal
losses
or
renal
losses
the
latter
due
to
primary
renal
magnesium
wasting
or
in
association
with
sodium
loss
Hypomagnesemia
may
arise
together
with
and
contribute
to
the
persistence
of
hypokalemia
and
hypocalcemia
The
major
direct
toxicity
of
hypomagnesemia
is
cardiovascular
When
urgent
correction
of
hypomagnesemia
is
required
as
with
myocardial
ischemia
post
cardiopulmonary
bypass
and
torsades
de
pointes
intravenous
or
intramuscular
magnesium
sulfate
should
be
used
Oral
magnesium
preparations
are
available
for
chronic
use
