Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
and
compare
the
safety
efficacy
and
cost
of
three
cervical
cytology
sampling
devices
in
pregnant
women
presenting
for
prenatal
care
to
the
obstetrics
clinic
at
Medical
College
of
Pennsylvania
Hospital
From
September
7
1993
to
November
5
1993
61
cervical
cytologic
smears
were
obtained
using
the
Cell-Sweep
From
November
8
1993
to
January
7
1994
66
smears
were
obtained
using
the
Ayre
spatula/Cytobrush
and
from
January
10
1994
to
February
18
1994
55
smears
were
obtained
using
the
Ayre
spatula/cotton
swab
The
rate
of
smears
with
no
endocervical
component
or
with
epithelial
cell
abnormality
was
determined
for
each
group
The
patients'
medical
records
were
reviewed
retrospectively
to
determine
complications
occurring
within
two
weeks
of
smear
collection
Fifteen
(25%)
smears
in
the
Cell-Sweep
group
one
(15%)
in
the
Cytobrush
group
and
nine
(16%)
in
the
cotton
swab
group
were
satisfactory
but
limited
by
absence
of
an
endocervical
component
(P
<
0006)
None
of
the
smears
were
unsatisfactory
Eleven
(18%)
smears
in
the
Cell-Sweep
group
eight
(12%)
in
the
Cytobrush
group
and
nine
(16%)
in
the
cotton
swab
group
revealed
an
epithelial
cell
abnormality
(P
=
643)
For
all
three
groups
there
was
a
low
rate
of
spontaneous
abortion
preterm
spontaneous
rupture
of
membranes
or
preterm
labor
occurring
within
two
weeks
of
collection
There
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
in
these
complications
between
the
three
groups
(P
=
7)
The
Ayre
spatula/cotton
swab
is
the
least
expensive
device
The
Ayre
spatula/cotton
swab
was
the
most
satisfactory
of
the
three
methods
tested
for
obtaining
cervical
cytology
during
pregnancy
It
is
safe
and
cost-effective
and
identifies
the
same
proportion
of
epithelial
cell
abnormalities
as
the
Ayre
spatula/Cytobrush
and
the
Cell-Sweep
