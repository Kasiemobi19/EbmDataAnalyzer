Reexamining
the
value
of
hematuria
testing
in
patients
with
acute
flank
pain
Abstract
Text
Hematuria
testing
is
routinely
performed
in
patients
with
acute
flank
pain
to
screen
for
ureterolithiasis
and
to
help
determine
the
need
for
excretory
urography
Unenhanced
helical
computerized
tomography
(CT)
has
recently
been
shown
to
be
superior
to
excretory
urography
in
diagnosing
ureteral
obstruction
and
can
evaluate
many
other
causes
of
flank
pain
Given
the
speed
accuracy
and
safety
of
CT
the
value
of
hematuria
testing
for
acute
flank
pain
should
be
reexamined
We
reviewed
the
medical
records
of
267
consecutive
patients
with
acute
flank
pain
referred
for
unenhanced
helical
CT
Microscopic
and
dipstick
urinalysis
data
were
obtained
in
195
patients
Using
helical
CT
as
the
gold
standard
we
calculated
the
sensitivity
specificity
predictive
value
and
accuracy
of
hematuria
for
diagnosing
ureterolithiasis
Of
the
patients
with
ureterolithiasis
33%
had
5
or
less
19%
had
1
or
less
and
11%
had
no
red
blood
cells
(RBCs)
per
high
power
field
Of
the
patients
without
ureterolithiasis
24%
had
greater
than
5
and
51%
had
greater
than
1
RBC
per
high
power
field
Of
the
patients
with
ureterolithiasis
14%
had
a
negative
dipstick
test
and
1
RBC
or
less
per
high
power
field
There
were
25
patients
without
ureterolithiasis
who
had
CT
abnormalities
unrelated
to
the
urinary
tract
of
whom
8
had
greater
than
1
RBC
per
high
power
field
Absence
of
hematuria
in
the
setting
of
acute
flank
pain
cannot
exclude
a
diagnosis
of
ureterolithiasis
and
should
not
obviate
other
diagnostic
testing
Even
when
strongly
positive
on
microscopy
hematuria
has
insufficient
positive
predictive
value
for
diagnosing
ureterolithiasis
and
may
be
misleading
as
other
serious
conditions
resulting
in
acute
flank
pain
may
yield
a
positive
test
