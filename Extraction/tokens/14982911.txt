Antihypertensive
treatment
based
on
blood
pressure
measurement
at
home
or
in
the
physician's
office
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Self-measurement
of
blood
pressure
is
increasingly
used
in
clinical
practice
but
how
it
affects
the
treatment
of
hypertension
requires
further
study
To
compare
use
of
blood
pressure
(BP)
measurements
taken
in
physicians'
offices
and
at
home
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
hypertension
Blinded
randomized
controlled
trial
conducted
from
March
1997
to
April
2002
at
56
primary
care
practices
and
3
hospital-based
outpatient
clinics
in
Belgium
and
1
specialized
hypertension
clinic
in
Dublin
Ireland
Four
hundred
participants
with
a
diastolic
BP
(DBP)
of
95
mm
Hg
or
more
as
measured
at
physicians'
offices
were
enrolled
and
followed
up
for
1
year
Antihypertensive
drug
treatment
was
adjusted
in
a
stepwise
fashion
based
on
either
the
self-measured
DBP
at
home
(average
of
6
measurements
per
day
during
1
week
n
=
203)
or
the
average
of
3
sitting
DBP
readings
at
the
physician's
office
(n
=
197)
If
the
DBP
guiding
treatment
was
above
(>89
mm
Hg)
at
(80-89
mm
Hg)
or
below
(<80
mm
Hg)
target
a
physician
blinded
to
randomization
intensified
antihypertensive
treatment
left
it
unchanged
or
reduced
it
respectively
Office
and
home
BP
levels
24-hour
ambulatory
BP
intensity
of
drug
treatment
electrocardiographic
and
echocardiographic
left
ventricular
mass
symptoms
reported
by
questionnaire
and
costs
of
treatment
At
the
end
of
the
study
(median
follow-up
350
days
interquartile
range
326-409
days)
more
home
BP
than
office
BP
patients
had
stopped
antihypertensive
drug
treatment
(256%
vs
113%
P<001)
with
no
significant
difference
in
the
proportions
of
patients
progressing
to
multiple-drug
treatment
(387%
vs
451%
P
=14)
The
final
office
home
and
24-hour
ambulatory
BP
measurements
were
higher
(P<001)
in
the
home
BP
group
than
in
the
office
BP
group
The
mean
baseline-adjusted
systolic/diastolic
differences
between
the
home
and
office
BP
groups
averaged
68/35
mm
Hg
49/29
mm
Hg
and
49/29
mm
Hg
respectively
Left
ventricular
mass
and
reported
symptoms
were
similar
in
the
2
groups
Costs
per
100
patients
followed
up
for
1
month
were
only
slightly
lower
in
the
home
BP
group
(3875
vs
3522
[4921
dollars
vs
4473
dollars]
P
=04)
Adjustment
of
antihypertensive
treatment
based
on
home
BP
instead
of
office
BP
led
to
less
intensive
drug
treatment
and
marginally
lower
costs
but
also
to
less
BP
control
with
no
differences
in
general
well-being
or
left
ventricular
mass
Self-measurement
allowed
identification
of
patients
with
white-coat
hypertension
Our
findings
support
a
stepwise
strategy
for
the
evaluation
of
BP
in
which
self-measurement
and
ambulatory
monitoring
are
complementary
to
conventional
office
measurement
and
highlight
the
need
for
prospective
outcome
studies
to
establish
the
normal
range
of
home-measured
BP
