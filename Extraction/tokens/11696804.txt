The
efficacy

safety
of
oral
desmopressin
in
children
with
primary
nocturnal
enuresis
Abstract
Text
We
confirmed
findings
that
oral
desmopressin
safely
decreases
the
number
of
wet
nights
in
children
with
enuresis
and
identified
doses
at
which
acceptable
responses
can
be
obtained
We
evaluated
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
oral
desmopressin
in
a
double-blind
placebo
controlled
parallel
group
randomized
multicenter
trial
of
193
children
6
to
16
years
old
with
documented
primary
nocturnal
enuresis
The
study
was
conducted
in
2
phases
1)
a
2-week
dose
ranging
phase
in
which
children
received
desmopressin
(02
04
or
06
mg)
or
placebo
at
bedtime
and
2)
an
8-week
dose
titration
phase
that
followed
a
2-week
placebo
washout
Patients
received
02
mg
desmopressin
or
placebo
for
the
first
2
weeks
and
then
the
dose
was
increased
in
02
mg
increments
at
2-week
intervals
until
the
patient
was
completely
dry
or
was
receiving
06
mg
Patients
were
instructed
to
limit
fluid
intake
Mean
decrease
from
baseline
in
the
number
of
wet
nights
percentage
of
responding
patients
and
safety
were
assessed
at
2-week
intervals
There
was
a
statistically
significant
linear
response
to
oral
desmopressin
at
doses
from
02
to
06
mg
during
the
dose
ranging
phase
(p
<
or
=005)
The
decrease
in
wet
nights
after
2
weeks
of
treatment
with
desmopressin
was
27%
30%
and
40%
at
02
04
and
06
mg
doses
respectively
compared
to
10%
with
placebo
All
doses
were
statistically
significantly
different
from
placebo
(p
<
or
=005)
During
the
dose
titration
phase
all
placebo
treated
and
87%
of
desmopressin
treated
patients
were
receiving
the
maximum
dose
of
3
tablets
nightly
because
they
had
not
been
completely
dry
in
the
previous
2
weeks
Nevertheless
44%
of
desmopressin
treated
patients
had
achieved
at
least
a
50%
reduction
from
baseline
in
the
number
of
wet
nights
per
2
weeks
at
the
lower
doses
of
02
and
04
mg
Most
adverse
events
(rhinitis
pharyngitis
headache
and
increased
cough)
were
mild
to
moderate
in
severity
unrelated
to
treatment
and
resolved
before
the
study
was
completed
Oral
desmopressin
administered
at
bedtime
to
children
with
primary
nocturnal
enuresis
was
significantly
better
than
placebo
for
decreasing
episodes
of
bed-wetting
(p
<005)
A
linear
dose-response
relationship
was
observed
(p
<005)
An
acceptable
response
to
treatment
(50%
or
greater
reduction
from
baseline
in
wet
nights
per
2
weeks)
was
seen
at
all
doses
of
desmopressin
Oral
desmopressin
up
to
06
mg
for
8
weeks
was
well
tolerated
