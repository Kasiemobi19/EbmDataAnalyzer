Title
Ionisers
for
chronic
asthma
Abstract
Text
Previous
reports
have
shown
that
ion
content
in
the
air
may
have
an
effect
on
respiratory
function
Results
from
studies
which
test
the
efficacy
of
air
ionisers
to
reduce
asthma
symptoms
are
often
inconclusive
and
their
use
as
a
treatment
for
asthma
remains
debatable
We
conducted
a
systematic
review
of
the
available
evidence
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
positive
and
negative
ion
generators
in
people
with
asthma
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Airways
Group
Asthma
trials
register
(January
1966
to
March
2003)
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(Cochrane
Library
issue

2003)
as
well
as
The
Alternative
Medicine
Database
AMED
(1985
to
March
2003)
Randomised
controlled
trials
(parallel
or
crossover
design
studies)
comparing
ionisers
with
dummy
ionisers
(being
negative
or
positive
ion
emitters)
in
children
or
adults
with
chronic
asthma
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
titles
and
abstracts
of
studies
and
assessed
trial
quality
Study
quality
was
determined
using
two
methodsThe
Cochrane
approach
to
allocation
concealment
and
the
five
point
Jadad
scale
Six
studies
were
selected
for
inclusion
(106
participants)
No
results
were
combined
as
the
studies
were
all
of
a
crossover
design
EFFECTS
OF
NEGATIVE
ION
GENERATORS
(five
studies)No
study
reported
a
significant
difference
in
lung
function
between
ionised
and
control
air
(morning
Peak
expiratory
flow
(PEF)
-
three
studies
forced
expiratory
flow
in
one
second
(FEV1)
-
one
study)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
symptoms
or
beta-2
agonist
usage
between
ionised
and
control
air
in
three
studies
EFFECTS
OF
POSITIVE
ION
GENERATORS
(one
study)This
study
demonstrated
that
although
positively
ionised
air
was
associated
with
a
larger
fall
in
FEV1
with
exercise
this
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
Baseline
FEV1
was
not
demonstrated
to
be
significantly
different
between
treatment
groups
Based
on
the
evidence
currently
available
from
randomised
controlled
trials
a
recommendation
cannot
be
given
for
the
use
of
room
air
ionisers
to
reduce
symptoms
in
patients
with
chronic
asthma
