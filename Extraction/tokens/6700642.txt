Efficacy
of
tonsillectomy
for
recurrent
throat
infection
in
severely
affected
children
Results
of
parallel
randomized
and
nonrandomized
clinical
trials
Abstract
Text
We
studied
the
efficacy
of
tonsillectomy
or
tonsillectomy
with
adenoidectomy
in
187
children
severely
affected
with
recurrent
throat
infection
Ninety-one
of
the
children
were
assigned
randomly
to
either
surgical
or
nonsurgical
treatment
groups
and
96
were
assigned
according
to
parental
preference
In
both
the
randomized
and
nonrandomized
trials
the
effects
of
tonsillectomy
and
of
tonsillectomy
with
adenoidectomy
were
similar
By
various
measures
the
incidence
of
throat
infection
during
the
first
two
years
of
follow-up
was
significantly
lower
(P
less
than
or
equal
to
005)
in
the
surgical
groups
than
in
the
corresponding
nonsurgical
groups
Third-year
differences
although
in
most
cases
not
significant
also
consistently
favored
the
surgical
groups
On
the
other
hand
in
each
follow-up
year
many
subjects
in
the
nonsurgical
groups
had
fewer
than
three
episodes
of
infection
and
most
episodes
among
subjects
in
the
nonsurgical
groups
were
mild
Of
the
95
subjects
treated
with
surgery
13
(14
per
cent)
had
surgery-related
complications
all
of
which
were
readily
managed
or
self-limited
These
results
warrant
the
election
of
tonsillectomy
for
children
meeting
the
trials'
stringent
eligibility
criteria
but
also
provide
support
for
nonsurgical
management
Treatment
for
such
children
must
therefore
be
individualized
