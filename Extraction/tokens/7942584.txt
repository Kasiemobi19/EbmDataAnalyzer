prospective

diet

Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
association
between
dietary
fiber
sources
of
fiber
other
nutrients
and
the
diagnosis
of
symptomatic
diverticular
disease
we
analyzed
data
from
a
prospective
cohort
of
47888
US
men
During
4
y
of
follow-up
we
documented
385
new
cases
of
symptomatic
diverticular
disease
Total
dietary
fiber
intake
was
inversely
associated
with
the
risk
of
diverticular
disease
after
adjustment
for
age
energy-adjusted
total
fat
intake
and
physical
activity

for

in
the
highest
as
compared
with
the
lowest
quintile
of
dietary
fiber]
This
inverse
association
was
primarily
due
to
fruit
and
vegetable
fiber
For
men
on
a
high-total-fat
low-fiber
diet
the
RR
was
235
(95%
CI
138
398)
compared
with
those
on
a
low-total-fat
high-fiber
diet
and
for
men
on
a
high-red-meat
low-fiber
diet
the
RR
was
332
(95%
CI
146
753)
compared
with
those
on
a
low-red-meat
high-fiber
diet
These
prospective
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
a
diet
low
in
total
dietary
fiber
increases
the
incidence
of
symptomatic
diverticular
disease
They
also
provide
evidence
that
the
combination
of
high
intake
of
total
fat
or
red
meat
and
a
diet
low
in
total
dietary
fiber
particularly
augments
the
risk
