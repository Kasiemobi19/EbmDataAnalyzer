Comparison

Abstract
Text
An
open
randomized
human-model
study
was
conducted
to
compare
the
effects
of
topical
antibiotics
a
wound
protectant
and
antiseptics
on
the
rate
of
wound
healing
and
bacterial
growth
using
a
modification
of
a
method
employing
ammonium
hydroxide-induced
intradermal
blisters
inoculated
with
Staphylococcus
aureus
Each
volunteer
in
the
study
had
six
blister
wounds
(three
per
forearm)
to
which
a
triple
antibiotic
(neomycin
polymyxin
B
bacitracin)
ointment
or
one
of
four
other
test
agents
was
applied
twice
a
day
A
control
wound
remained
untreated
All
wounds
were
covered
with
an
occlusive
dressing
after
treatment
The
time
to
healing
(100
percent
epithelialization)
was
evaluated
for
each
wound
Wounds
were
cultured
for
bacterial
growth
after
two
treatments
Contaminated
blister
wounds
treated
with
the
triple
antibiotic
ointment
healed
significantly
faster
(mean
nine
days)
than
wounds
treated
with
any
antiseptic
and
those
receiving
no
treatment
Only
the
neomycin-polymyxin
B-bacitracin
combination
effectively
eliminated
bacterial
contamination
of
the
wounds
after
two
applications
(within
16
to
24
hours
after
contamination
with
Staphylococcus
aureus)
The
overall
clinical
appearance
and
healing
rates
of
wounds
treated
with
the
triple
antibiotic
were
ranked
superior
to
all
treatments
(and
no
treatment)
except
the
other
antibiotic
ointment
in
the
study
