Title
Alarm
interventions
for
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
Abstract
Text
Enuresis
(bedwetting)
is
a
socially
disruptive
and
stressful
condition
which
affects
around
15-20%
of
five
year
olds
and
up
to
2%
of
young
adults
To
assess
the
effects
of
alarm
interventions
on
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
and
to
compare
alarms
with
other
interventions
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Incontinence
Group
trials
register
(December
2002)
and
the
reference
lists
of
relevant
articles
Date
of
the
most
recent
searches
December
2002
All
randomised
or
quasi-randomised
trials
of
alarm
interventions
for
nocturnal
enuresis
in
children
were
included
except
those
focused
solely
on
daytime
wetting
Comparison
interventions
included
no
treatment
simple
and
complex
behavioural
methods
desmopressin
tricyclics
and
miscellaneous
other
methods
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
the
quality
of
the
eligible
trials
and
extracted
data
Fifty
three
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
involving
2862
children
The
quality
of
many
trials
was
poor
and
evidence
for
many
comparisons
was
inadequate
Most
alarms
used
audio
methods
Compared
to
no
treatment
about
two
thirds
of
children
became
dry
during
alarm
use
(RR
for
failure
036
95%
CI
031
to
043)
Nearly
half
who
persisted
with
alarm
use
remained
dry
after
treatment
finished
compared
to
almost
none
after
no
treatment
(RR
of
failure
or
relapse
45/81
(55%)
vs
80/81
(99%)
RR
056
95%
CI
046
to
068)
There
was
insufficient
evidence
to
draw
conclusions
about
different
types
of
alarm
or
about
how
alarms
compare
to
other
behavioural
interventions
Relapse
rates
were
lower
when
overlearning
was
added
to
alarm
treatment
(RR
192
95%
CI
127
to
292)
Penalties
for
wet
beds
appeared
to
be
counter-productive
Alarms
using
electric
shocks
were
unacceptable
to
children
or
their
parents
Although
desmopressin
may
have
a
more
immediate
effect
alarms
appear
more
effective
by
the
end
of
a
course
of
treatment
(RR
071
95%
CI
050
to
099)
and
there
was
limited
evidence
of
greater
long-term
success
(RR
4/22
(18%)
vs
16/24
(67%)RR
027
95%
CI
011
to
069)
Alarms
were
better
than
tricyclics
during
treatment
(RR
073
95%
CI
061
to
088)
and
afterwards
(7/12
(58%)
vs
12/12
(100%)
RR
058
95%
CI
036
to
094)
Alarm
interventions
are
an
effective
treatment
for
nocturnal
bedwetting
in
children
Alarms
appear
more
effective
than
desmopressin
or
tricyclics
by
the
end
of
treatment
and
subsequently
Overlearning
(giving
extra
fluids
at
bedtime
after
successfully
becoming
dry
using
an
alarm)
and
avoiding
penalties
may
further
reduce
the
relapse
rate
Better
quality
research
comparing
alarms
with
other
treatments
is
needed
including
follow-up
to
determine
relapse
rates
