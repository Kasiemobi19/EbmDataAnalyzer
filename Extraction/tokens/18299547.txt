Title
The
efficacy
and
safety
of
intensive
statin
therapy
a
meta-analysis
of
randomized
trials
Abstract
Text
Recent
lipid
guidelines
recommend
aggressive
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
lowering
in
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
To
clarify
the
evidence
for
this
recommendation
we
conducted
a
meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
that
compared
different
intensities
of
statin
therapy
We
searched
electronic
databases
(MEDLINE
EMBASE
Cochrane
Central
Registery
of
Controlled
Trials
Web
of
Science)
for
randomized
controlled
trials
published
up
to
July
19
2007
that
compared
statin
regimens
of
different
intensities
in
adults
with
coronary
artery
disease
and
that
reported
cardiovascular
events
or
mortality
Data
were
pooled
using
random-effects
models
to
calculate
odds
ratios
(OR)
A
total
of
7
trials
(29
395
patients)
were
included
Compared
with
less
intensive
statin
regimens
more
intensive
regimens
further
reduced
LDL
levels
(072
mmol/L
reduction
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
060-084
mmol/L)
and
reduced
the
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
(OR
083
95%
CI
077-091)
and
stroke
(OR
082
95%
CI
071-095)
Although
there
was
no
effect
on
mortality
among
patients
with
chronic
coronary
artery
disease
(OR
096
95%
CI
080-114)
all-cause
mortality
was
reduced
among
patients
with
acute
coronary
syndromes
treated
with
more
intensive
statin
regimens
(OR
075
95%
CI
061-093)
Compared
with
lower
intensity
regimens
more
intensive
regimens
were
associated
with
small
absolute
increases
in
rates
of
drug
discontinuation
(25%)
elevated
levels
of
aminotransferases
(1%)
and
myopathy
(05%)
and
there
was
no
difference
in
noncardiovascular
mortality
All
7
trials
reported
events
by
randomization
arm
rather
than
by
LDL
level
achieved
About
half
of
the
patients
treated
with
more
intensive
statin
therapy
did
not
achieve
an
LDL
level
of
less
than
20
mmol/L
and
none
of
the
trials
tested
combination
therapies
Our
analysis
supports
the
use
of
more
intensive
statin
regimens
in
patients
with
established
coronary
artery
disease
There
is
insufficient
evidence
to
advocate
treating
to
particular
LDL
targets
using
combination
lipid-lowering
therapy
to
achieve
these
targets
or
for
using
more
intensive
regimens
in
patients
without
established
coronary
artery
disease
