Factors
associated
with
tuberculin
reactivity
among
the
foreign-born
in
Montreal
Abstract
Text
Because
tuberculosis
among
the
foreign-born
is
of
increasing
importance
in
North
America
it
has
recently
been
recommended
that
newly
arriving
immigrants
be
tuberculin
tested
and
preventive
therapy
given
to
all
those
with
significant
reactions
The
factors
affecting
the
prevalence
of
tuberculin
reactions
were
assessed
in
a
community-based
tuberculin
survey
among
foreign-born
schoolchildren
and
young
adults
Of
1198
foreign-born
who
were
tuberculin
tested
324%
had
significant
tuberculin
reactions
False-positive
tuberculin
reactions
due
to
sensitivity
to
purified
protein
derivative
(PPD)-B
(for
Mycobacterium
avium)
were
uncommon
and
those
due
to
BCG
vaccination
of
importance
only
among
immigrants
from
countries
with
low
tuberculosis
rates
Tuberculin
reactions
of
10+
mm
were
associated
with
tuberculosis
rates

the
