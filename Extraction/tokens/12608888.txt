Abstract
Text
Insomnia
affects
30-35%
of
people
living
in
developed
countries
The
impact
of
insomnia
on
daytime
functioning
and
its
relationship
with
medical
and
psychiatric
illnesses
necessitate
early
treatment
to
prevent
insomnia
becoming
persistent
and
to
avoid
the
development
of
complications
However
pharmacological
strategies
must
achieve
a
balance
between
sedative
and
adverse
effects
In
the
last
30
years
benzodiazepines
have
been
the
preferred
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
insomnia
Benzodiazepines
act
nonselectively
at
two
central
receptor
sites
named
omega(1)
and
omega(2)
which
are
located
in
different
areas
of
the
CNS
The
sedative
action
of
benzodiazepines
is
related
to
omega(1)
receptors
whereas
omega(2)
receptors
are
responsible
for
their
effects
on
memory
and
cognitive
functioning
According
to
their
pharmacokinetic
profile
benzodiazepines
can
be
classified
into
three
groups
short
half-life
(<3
hours)
medium
half-life
(8-24
hours)
and
long
half-life
(>24
hours)
The
newer
non-benzodiazepine
agents
zopiclone
zolpidem
and
zaleplon
have
a
hypnosedative
action
comparable
with
that
of
benzodiazepines
but
they
display
specific
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
properties
These
three
'Z'
agents
all
share
a
short
plasma
half-life
and
limited
duration
of
action
In
addition
these
agents
are
selective
compounds
that
interact
preferentially
with
omega(1)
receptors
(sedative
effect)
whereas
benzodiazepines
also
interact
with
omega(2)
receptors
(adverse
effects
on
cognitive
performance
and
memory)
Zaleplon
is
characterised
by
an
ultrashort
half-life
(approximately
1
hour)
Zolpidem
and
zopiclone
have
longer
half-lives
(approximately
24
and
5
hours
respectively)
These
properties
together
with
the
low
risk
of
residual
effect
may
explain
the
limited
negative
influences
of
these
agents
on
daytime
performance
Psychomotor
tasks
and
memory
capacities
appear
to
be
better
preserved
by
non-benzodiazepine
agents
than
by
benzodiazepines
When
present
cognitive
deficits
almost
exclusively
coincide
with
the
peak
plasma
concentration
In
particular
impairment
can
emerge
in
the
first
hours
after
drug
administration
whereas
psychomotor
and
memory
tests
carried
out
7-8
hours
later
(ie
in
the
morning)
generally
show
no
relevant
alterations
As
with
benzodiazepines
the
three
'Z'
non-benzodiazepine
agents
should
be
used
for
a
limited
period
even
in
chronic
relapsing
conditions
Further
evaluation
is
needed
of
the
safety
of
hypnosedative
medications
in
the
long-term
management
of
insomnia
