Title
Use
of
a
new
thickened
formula
for
treatment
of
symptomatic
gastrooesophageal
reflux
in
infants
Abstract
Text
Paediatricians
are
familiar
with
infants
complaining
of
regurgitation
and
emesis
from
gastrooesophageal
reflux
These
subjects
usually
growing
satisfactorily
and
healthy
are
affected
by
"functional"
or
"symptomatic"
gastrooesophagel
reflux
and
are
treated
with
posture
changes
and
thickened
feedings
To
evaluate
in
infants
with
symptomatic
gastrooesophageal
reflux
the
effect
of
a
new
formula
(Nutrilon
AR)
containing
carob
flour/locus
bean
gum
as
a
thickening
agent
both
clinical
features
and
oesophageal
acid
exposure
were
evaluated
Twenty-four
infants
(age
range
5-11
months
median
age
8
months
8
females)
presented
at
our
Unit
with
a
history
of
chronic
postprandial
regurgitation
During
a
24-hour
intraoesophageal
pH
test
a
traditional
formula
thickened
with
rice
flour
at
a
concentration
of
5%
was
alternated
with
the
formula
Nutrilon
AR
thereafter
infants
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
for
two
weeks
either
a
traditional
thickened
formula
or
the
new
formula
in
addition
to
posture
changes
Intraoesophageal
acid
exposure
was
significantly
lower
in
the
periods
following
the
new
formula
than
after
traditional
formula
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
period
patients
receiving
the
new
formula
had
a
more
significant
decrease
of
both
symptomatic
score
and
number
of
episodes
of
emesis
than
patients
on
traditional
formula
The
new
available
formula
with
the
characteristics
of
a
thickened
meal
is
better
than
a
formula
traditionally
thickened
with
added
rice
flour
in
the
conservative
treatment
of
infants
with
symptomatic
gastrooesophageal
reflux
