Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
test
performance
characteristics
of
various
modalities
for
the
diagnosis
of
suspected
lung
cancer
A
systematic
search
of
MEDLINE
HealthStar
and
Cochrane
Library
databases
to
July
2001
and
print
bibliographies
was
performed
to
identify
studies
comparing
the
results
of
sputum
cytology
bronchoscopy
transthoracic
needle
aspirate
(TTNA)
or
biopsy
with
histologic
reference
standard
diagnoses
among
at
least
50
patients
with
suspected
lung
cancer
For
sputum
cytology
the
pooled
specificity
was
099
and
the
pooled
sensitivity
was
066
but
sensitivity
was
higher
for
central
lesions
than
for
peripheral
lesions
(071
vs
049
respectively)
Studies
on
bronchoscopic
procedures
provided
data
only
on
diagnostic
yield
(sensitivity)
The
diagnosis
of
endobronchial
disease
by
bronchoscopy
in
30
studies
showed
the
highest
sensitivity
for
endobronchial
biopsy
(074)
followed
by
cytobrushing
(059)
and
washing
(048)
The
sensitivity
for
all
modalities
combined
was
088
Thirty
studies
reported
on
peripheral
lesions
Cytobrushing
demonstrated
the
highest
sensitivity
(052)
followed
by
transbronchial
biopsy
(046)
and
BAL/washing
(043)
The
overall
sensitivity
for
all
modalities
was
069
Peripheral
lesions
<
2
cm
or
>
2
cm
in
diameter
showed
sensitivities
of
033
and
062
respectively
Updating
a
previous
meta-analysis
with
19
studies
revealed
a
pooled
sensitivity
of
090
for
TTNA
A
trend
toward
lower
sensitivity
was
noted
for
lesions
that
were
<
2
cm
in
diameter
The
accuracy
in
differentiating
between
small
cell
and
non-small
cell
cytology
for
the
various
diagnostic
modalities
was
098
with
individual
studies
ranging
from
094
to
10
The
average
false-positive
and
false-negative
rates
were
009
and
002
respectively
The
sensitivity
of
bronchoscopy
is
high
for
endobronchial
disease
and
poor
for
peripheral
lesions
that
are
<
2
cm
in
diameter
The
sensitivity
of
TTNA
is
excellent
for
malignant
disease
The
distinction
between
small
cell
lung
cancer
and
non-small
cell
lung
cancer
by
cytology
appears
to
be
accurate
