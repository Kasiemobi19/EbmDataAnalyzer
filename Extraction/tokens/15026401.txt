Cardiovascular
prognosis
of
"masked
hypertension"
detected

blood

self-measurement
in
elderly

hypertensive
patients
Abstract
Text
Blood
pressure
(BP)
measurement
in
clinicians'
offices
with
a
mercury
sphygmomanometer
has
numerous
drawbacks
In
contrast
the
use
of
home
BP
measurement
improves
measurement
precision
and
reproducibility
However
data
about
its
prognostic
value
are
lacking
To
assess
the
prognostic
value
of
home
vs
office
BP
measurement
by
general
practitioners
in
a
European
population
of
elderly
patients
being
treated
for
hypertension
Office
and
home
BP
and
cardiac
risk
factors
were
measured
at
baseline
in
a
cohort
of
4939
treated
hypertensive
patients
(mean
age
70
[SD
65]
years
489%
men)
who
were
recruited
and
followed
up
by
their
usual
general
practitioners
without
specific
recommendations
about
their
management
The
cohort
was
then
followed
up
for
a
mean
of
32
(SD
05)
years
The
thresholds
defining
uncontrolled
hypertension
were
at
least
140/90
mm
Hg
for
office
BP
and
135/85
mm
Hg
for
home
BP
The
primary
end
point
was
cardiovascular
mortality
Secondary
end
points
were
total
mortality
and
the
combination
of
cardiovascular
mortality
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
nonfatal
stroke
transient
ischemic
attack
hospitalization
for
angina
or
heart
failure
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
or
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
surgery
At
the
end
of
follow-up
clinical
status
was
known
for
999%
of
patients
At
least
1
cardiovascular
event
had
occurred
in
324
(incidence
222/1000
patient-years)
For
BP
self-measurement
at
home
each
10-mm
Hg
increase
in
systolic
BP
increased
the
risk
of
a
cardiovascular
event
by
172%
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
110%-238%)
and
each
5-mm
Hg
increase
in
diastolic
BP
increased
that
risk
by
117%
(95%
CI
57%-181%)
Conversely
for
the
same
increase
in
BP
observed
using
office
measurement
there
was
no
significant
increase
in
the
risk
of
a
cardiovascular
event
In
a
multivariable
model
with
patients
having
controlled
hypertension
(normal
home
and
office
BP)
as
the
referent
the
hazard
ratio
of
cardiovascular
events
was
196
(95%
CI
127-302)
in
patients
with
uncontrolled
hypertension
(high
BP
with
both
measurement
methods)
206
(95%
CI
122-347)
in
patients
with
normal
office
BP
and
elevated
home
BP
and
118
(95%
CI
067-210)
in
patients
with
elevated
office
BP
and
normal
home
BP
Our
findings
suggest
that
home
BP
measurement
has
a
better
prognostic
accuracy
than
office
BP
measurement
Blood
pressure
should
systematically
be
measured
at
home
in
patients
receiving
treatment
for
hypertension
