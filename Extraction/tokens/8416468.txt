Essential
fatty
acids
in
the
treatment
of
premenstrual
syndrome
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
essential
fatty
acids
are
effective
in
the
treatment
of
premenstrual
syndrome
(PMS)
In
a
randomized
double-blind
crossover
trial
we
studied
27
women
diagnosed
with
PMS
over
ten
menstrual
cycles
and
22
symptom-free
controls
over
one
cycle
The
first
cycle
was
used
for
diagnostic
assessment
For
the
women
with
PMS
placebos
were
administered
during
the
second
cycle
This
was
followed
by
randomization
to
four
cycles
of
active
treatment
with
essential
fatty
acids
and
four
cycles
of
placebo
with
a
crossover
after
completion
of
the
fourth
cycle
Assessment
of
symptoms
and
diagnosis
of
PMS
were
based
on
daily
self-ratings
made
by
the
women
throughout
the
study
Treatment
with
essential
fatty
acids
did
not
reduce
premenstrual
symptoms
or
symptom
cyclicity
However
time
had
a
significant
effect
on
a
number
of
symptoms
indicating
either
a
placebo
effect
or
an
effect
from
participation
in
the
study
Women
with
PMS
had
a
significantly
higher
frequency
of
dysmenorrhea
and
familial
PMS
than
did
the
symptom-free
controls
Treatment
with
essential
fatty
acids
is
ineffective
therapy
for
PMS
The
improvement
we
observed
over
time
can
be
ascribed
to
either
a
placebo
effect
or
participation
in
the
study
