Abstract
Text
The
Physicians'
Health
Study
is
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
designed
to
determine
whether
low-dose
aspirin
(325
mg
every
other
day)
decreases
cardiovascular
mortality
and
whether
beta
carotene
reduces
the
incidence
of
cancer
The
aspirin
component
was
terminated
earlier
than
scheduled
and
the
preliminary
findings
were
published
We
now
present
detailed
analyses
of
the
cardiovascular
component
for
22071
participants
at
an
average
follow-up
time
of
602
months
There
was
a
44
percent
reduction
in
the
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
(relative
risk
056
95
percent
confidence
interval
045
to
070
P
less
than
000001)
in
the
aspirin
group
(2548
per
100000
per
year
as
compared
with
4397
in
the
placebo
group)
A
slightly
increased
risk
of
stroke
among
those
taking
aspirin
was
not
statistically
significant
this
trend
was
observed
primarily
in
the
subgroup
with
hemorrhagic
stroke
(relative
risk
214
95
percent
confidence
interval
096
to
477
P
=
006)
No
reduction
in
mortality
from
all
cardiovascular
causes
was
associated
with
aspirin
(relative
risk
096
95
percent
confidence
interval
060
to
154)
Further
analyses
showed
that
the
reduction
in
the
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
was
apparent
only
among
those
who
were
50
years
of
age
and
older
The
benefit
was
present
at
all
levels
of
cholesterol
but
appeared
greatest
at
low
levels
The
relative
risk
of
ulcer
in
the
aspirin
group
was
122
(169
in
the
aspirin
group
as
compared
with
138
in
the
placebo
group
95
percent
confidence
interval
098
to
153
P
=
008)
and
the
relative
risk
of
requiring
a
blood
transfusion
was
171
This
trial
of
aspirin
for
the
primary
prevention
of
cardiovascular
disease
demonstrates
a
conclusive
reduction
in
the
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
but
the
evidence
concerning
stroke
and
total
cardiovascular
deaths
remains
inconclusive
because
of
the
inadequate
numbers
of
physicians
with
these
end
points
