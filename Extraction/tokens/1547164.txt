Does
admission
to
hospital
for
bed
rest
prevent
disease
progression
or
improve
fetal
outcome
in
pregnancy
complicated
by
non-proteinuric
hypertension
Abstract
Text
To
test
whether
a
policy
of
admission
to
hospital
for
rest
is
of
value
in
the
management
of
women
with
non-proteinuric
hypertension
during
pregnancy
A
randomized
controlled
trial
Harare
Maternity
Hospital
Zimbabwe
218
(28
first
pregnancies)
women
with
non-proteinuric
hypertension
and
a
singleton
pregnancy
at
between
28
and
38
weeks
gestation
allocated
to
rest
in
hospital
or
routine
outpatient
care
Admission
to
hospital
for
rest
Encouraged
to
rest
in
bed
although
voluntary
ambulation
around
the
ward
was
allowed
The
women
in
the
control
group
were
encouraged
to
continue
normal
activity
at
home
to
check
urine
each
day
for
proteinuria
All
the
women
were
reviewed
weekly
Disease
progression
was
assessed
by
the
development
of
severe
hypertension
(greater
than
or
equal
to
160/110
mmHg)
development
of
proteinuria
need
for
induction
of
labour
and
number
of
infants
born
preterm
(less
than
37
weeks)
Fetal
outcome
was
assessed
by
birthweight
number
of
infants
small-for-gestational
age
(SGA)
and
the
number
of
infants
requiring
admission
to
the
neonatal
unit
and
their
length
of
stay
The
hospital
rest
group
had
a
decreased
risk
of
developing
severe
hypertension
(blood
pressure
greater
than
or
equal
to
160/110
mmHg
[odds
ratio
047
95%
CI
026-083])
No
differences
were
found
in
fetal
growth
or
neonatal
morbidity
The
mean
antenatal
stay
in
hospital
was
222
(SD
165)
and
65
(SD
79)
days
in
the
rest
and
control
groups
respectively
Hospital
admission
for
bed
rest
decreased
the
risk
of
developing
severe
hypertension
but
no
improvement
in
fetal
growth
or
neonatal
morbidity
was
observed
Fetal
monitoring
at
home
and
continued
outpatient
antenatal
care
provided
a
safe
alternative
policy
to
hospital
admission
