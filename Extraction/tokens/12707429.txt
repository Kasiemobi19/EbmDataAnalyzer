Pregabalin
for
the
treatment
of
postherpetic
neuralgia
a
randomized
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
pregabalin
in
the
treatment
of
postherpetic
neuralgia
(PHN)
The
authors
conducted
a
multicenter
parallel-group
double-blind
placebo-controlled
8-week
randomized
clinical
trial
in
PHN
defined
as
pain
for
3
or
more
months
following
herpes
zoster
rash
healing
Patients
(n
=
173)
were
randomized
to
treatment
with
pregabalin
or
placebo
Patients
randomized
to
pregabalin
received
either
600
mg/day
(creatinine
clearance
>
60
mL/min)
or
300
mg/day
(creatinine
clearance
30
to
60
mL/min)
The
primary
efficacy
measure
was
the
mean
of
the
last
seven
daily
pain
ratings
Secondary
endpoints
included
additional
pain
ratings
sleep
interference
quality
of
life
mood
and
patient
and
clinician
ratings
of
global
improvement
Pregabalin-treated
patients
had
greater
decreases
in
pain
than
patients
treated
with
placebo
(endpoint
mean
scores
360
vs
529
p
=
00001)
Pain
was
significantly
reduced
in
the
pregabalin-treated
patients
after
the
first
full
day
of
treatment
and
throughout
the
study
and
significant
improvement
on
the
McGill
Pain
Questionnaire
total
sensory
and
affective
pain
scores
was
also
found
The
proportions
of
patients
with
>or=30%
and
>or=50%
decreases
in
mean
pain
scores
were
greater
in
the
pregabalin
than
in
the
placebo
group
(63%
vs
25%
and
50%
vs
20%
p
=
0001)
Sleep
also
improved
in
patients
treated
with
pregabalin
compared
to
placebo
(p
=
00001)
Both
patients
and
clinicians
were
more
likely
to
report
global
improvement
with
pregabalin
than
placebo
(p
=
0001)
Given
the
maximal
dosage
studied
pregabalin
had
acceptable
tolerability
compared
to
placebo
despite
a
greater
incidence
of
side
effects
which
were
generally
mild
to
moderate
in
intensity
Treatment
of
PHN
with
pregabalin
is
safe
efficacious
in
relieving
pain
and
sleep
interference
and
associated
with
greater
global
improvement
than
treatment
with
placebo
