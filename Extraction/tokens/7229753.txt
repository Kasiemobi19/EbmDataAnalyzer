Iron
deficiency
in
one-year-old
infants
comparison
of
results
of
a
therapeutic
trial
in
infants
with
anemia
or
low-normal
hemoglobin
values
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
Hgb
response
to
a
therapeutic
trial
of
iron
in
infants
with
anemia
compared
to
those
with
low-normal
hemoglobin
values
Hgb
was
determined
in
1128
one-year-old
infants
The
278
infants
(25%)
who
had
an
Hgb
less
than
115
gm/dl
were
given
a
three-month
oral
course
of
ferrous
sulfate
(3
mg
iron/kg/day)
the
regimen
was
satisfactorily
completed
by
188
infants
Of
the
75
infants
whose
initial
capillary
Hgb
was
in
the
anemic
range
(Hgb
less
than
110
gm/dl)
45%
had
an
increase
in
venous
Hgb
greater
than
or
equal
to
10
gm/dl
Of
the
113
infants
with
initial
capillary
values
in
the
low-normal
range
(110
to
114
gm/dl)
28%
had
greater
than
or
equal
to
10
gm/dl
Hgb
response
Despite
the
lower
rate
of
response
in
the
low-normal
group
almost
half
of
the
infants
with
a
greater
than
or
equal
to
1
gm/dl
response
would
have
been
missed
by
using
the
generally
accepted
cutoff
value
of
11
gm/dl
for
a
therapeutic
trial
Because
of
the
low
cost
and
simplicity
of
a
therapeutic
trial
we
favor
including
the
low-normal
Hgb
group
for
a
therapeutic
trial
of
iron
in
order
to
avoid
missing
iron-responsive
individuals
among
groups
of
infants
with
a
similarly
high
prevalence
of
iron
deficiency
anemia
