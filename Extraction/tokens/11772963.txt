A
randomised
study
of
screening
for
colorectal
cancer
using
faecal
occult
blood
testing
results
after
13
years
and
seven
biennial
screening
rounds
Abstract
Text
Three
randomised
trials
have
demonstrated
reduction
in
mortality
from
colorectal
cancer
(CRC)
by
repeated
screening
with
faecal
occult
blood
tests
including
the
trial
presented
here
which
is
the
only
one
still
in
progress
To
evaluate
reduction
in
mortality
after
seven
screening
rounds
and
the
possible
influence
of
compliance
on
mortality
from
CRC
At
Funen
in
Denmark
random
allocation
to
biennial
screening
with
Hemoccult-II
in
30
967
subjects
aged
45-75
years
and
30966
controls
was
performed
in
1985
from
a
population
of
137485
of
the
same
age
Only
participants
who
completed
the
first
screening
round
were
invited
for
further
screening
Colonoscopy
was
offered
if
the
test
was
positive
The
primary
end
point
was
death
from
CRC
and
the
10
year
results
were
published
in
1996
From
the
beginning
of
the
first
screening
to
the
seventh
round
mean
age
increased
from
598
to
700
years
in
the
screening
and
control
groups
and
the
male/female
ratio
decreased
from
092
to
081
Those
who
accepted
screening
were
younger
than
non-responders
Positivity
rates
varied
from
08%
to
38%
the
cumulative
ratio
of
a
positive
test
was
51%
after
seven
rounds
and
48%
of
patients
had
at
least
one
colonoscopy
Mortality
from
CRC
was
significantly
less
in
the
screening
group
(relative
risk
(RR)
082
(069-097))
and
the
reduction
in
mortality
was
most
pronounced
above
the
sigmoid
colon
After
seven
rounds
RR
was
reduced
to
less
than
070
compared
with
controls
Mortality
rates
from
causes
other
than
CRC
did
not
differ
Non-responders
had
a
significantly
increased
risk
of
death
from
CRC
compared
with
those
who
accepted
the
full
programme
Subjects
who
accepted
the
first
screening
but
not
subsequent
ones
demonstrated
a
tendency
towards
increased
risk
The
persistent
reduction
in
mortality
from
CRC
in
a
biennial
screening
program
with
Hemoccult-II
and
a
reduction
in
RR
to
less
than
070
in
those
adhering
to
the
programme
support
attempts
to
introduce
larger
scale
population
screening
programmes
The
smaller
effect
on
mortality
from
CRC
in
the
rectum
and
sigmoid
colon
suggests
evaluation
by
additional
flexible
sigmoidoscopy
with
longer
intervals
