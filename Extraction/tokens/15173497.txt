Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
usefulness
of
parent
history
of
hypercholesterolemia
and
cardiovascular
disease
as
a
screening
criterion
for
hypercholesterolemia
in
youths
Data
were
available
from
a
population-based
survey
of
3665
Quebec
youths
aged
9
13
and
16
years
(812%
of
eligible
subjects)
Blood
specimens
were
collected
from
2475
subjects
(548%
of
those
eligible)
and
questionnaire
data
were
obtained
from
3048
parents
(675%
of
those
eligible)
Lipids
were
measured
in
a
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
standardized
laboratory
Usefulness
of
parent
history
in
identifying
borderline/high
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C)
(>
or
=28
mmol/L
[>
or
=110
mg/dL])
and
high
LDL-C
(>
or
=34
mmol/L
[>
or
=130
mg/dL])
was
assessed
according
to
test
performance
statistics
(sensitivity
specificity
positive
predictive
value
and
negative
predictive
value)
The
prevalence
of
a
positive
parent
history
was
256%
183%
of
subjects
had
borderline/high
LDL-C
and
48%
had
high
LDL-C
Sensitivity
specificity
positive
predictive
value
and
negative
predictive
value
of
parent
history
were
331%
760%
237%
and
835%
respectively
for
identifying
borderline/high
LDL-C
they
were
407%
751%
77%
and
961%
for
identifying
high
LDL-C
Test
performance
statistics
were
not
improved
in
subgroups
defined
according
to
age
gender
parent
education
household
income
family
status
and
family
origin
(French
Canadian
other)
neither
were
they
improved
by
adding
screening
criteria
(parent
history
of
diabetes
or
hypertension
or
youth
overweight)
Parent
history
screening
criteria
offer
little
improvement
over
random
population
screening
in
identifying
youths
with
hypercholesterolemia
