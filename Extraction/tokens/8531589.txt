room-sharing
and
prone
sleep
position
in
sudden

Abstract
Text
There
is
evidence
that
the
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
is
lower
among
ethnic
groups
in
which
parents
generally
share
a
room
with
the
infant
for
sleeping
We
investigated
whether
the
presence
of
other
family
members
in
the
infant's
sleeping
room
affects
the
risk
of
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
The
case-control
study
covered
a
region
with
78%
of
all
births
in
New
Zealand
during
1987-90
Home
interviews
were
completed
with
parents
of
393
(810%
of
total)
babies
who
died
from
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
aged
28
days
to
1
year
and
1592
(884%
of
total)
controls
selected
from
all
hospital
births
in
the
study
region
The
relative
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
for
sharing
the
room
with
one
or
more
adults
compared
with
not
sharing
was
019
(95%
CI
008-045)
for
sharing
at
night
during
the
last
2
weeks
and
027
(017-041)
for
sharing
in
the
last
sleep
after
control
for
other
confounders
Sharing
the
room
with
one
or
more
children
did
not
affect
the
relative
risk
(125
[086-182]
for
sharing
during
last
2
weeks
129
[085-194]
for
sharing
in
last
sleep)
There
was
a
significant
interaction
(p
=
0033)
between
not
sharing
the
room
with
an
adult
and
prone
sleep
position
in
the
last
sleep
Compared
with
infants
sharing
the
room
with
an
adult
and
not
prone
the
multivariate
relative
risk
was
1699
(1043-2769)
for
infants
not
sharing
with
an
adult
and
prone
328
(206-523)
for
infants
sharing
the
room
and
prone
and
260
(158-430)
for
infants
not
sharing
the
room
and
not
prone
The
interaction
between
adult
room-sharing
and
prone
sleep
position
suggests
that
both
exposures
may
affect
the
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
through
a
common
mechanism
We
recommend
that
infants
sleep
in
the
same
bedroom
as
their
parents
at
night
to
reduce
the
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
