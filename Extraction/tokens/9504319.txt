Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
effects
of
weight
loss
on
health-related
quality
of
life
(HRQL)
in
subjects
with
severe
obesity
Controlled
clinical
trial
of
the
outcomes
of
surgical
vs
conventional
weight
reduction
treatment
The
first
487
surgical
cases
and
their
conventionally
treated
matched
controls
were
followed
for
two
years
in
the
Swedish
Obese
Subjects
(SOS)
intervention
study
A
battery
of
generic
and
study-specific
self-assessment
instruments
or
subscales
was
used
to
characterize
HRQL
in
the
severely
obese
(BMI)
>
or
=
34
kg/m2
for
males
and
BMI
>
or
=
38
kg/m2
for
females)
Measures
of
general
health
perceptions
(general
health
rating
index
current
health)
mental
well-being
(mood
adjective
check
list
pleasantness
activation
and
calmness)
mood
disorders
(hospital
anxiety
and
depression
scale
anxiety
and
depression)
and
social
interaction
(sickness
impact
profile)
were
supplemented
by
obesity-specific
modules
on
obesity-related
psychosocial
problems
and
eating
behavior
(three-factor
eating
questionnaire
restrained
eating
disinhibition
and
perceived
hunger)
Assessments
were
conducted
prior
to
treatment
and
repeated
after
6
12
and
24
months
Poor
HRQL
before
intervention
was
dramatically
improved
after
gastric
restriction
surgery
while
only
minor
fluctuations
in
HRQL
scores
were
observed
in
the
conventionally
treated
controls
Peak
values
were
observed
in
the
surgical
group
at
6
or
12
months
after
intervention
with
a
slight
to
moderate
decrease
at
the
two-year
follow-up
The
positive
changes
in
HRQL
after
two
years
were
related
to
the
magnitude
of
weight
loss
that
is
the
greater
the
weight
reduction
the
greater
the
HRQL
improvements
Eating
behavior
improved
accordingly
Quality
of
life
in
the
severely
obese
is
improved
by
substantial
weight
loss
Most
patients
benefit
from
weight
reduction
surgery
while
HRQL
in
surgical
patients
with
minor
reduction
in
overweight
is
less
positive
Further
research
is
needed
to
determine
outcome
predictors
of
the
surgical
management
of
severe
obesity
and
to
ensure
that
HRQL
improvements
are
maintained
