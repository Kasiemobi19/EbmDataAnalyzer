Replacement
dose
metabolism
and
bioavailability
of
levothyroxine
in
the
treatment
of
hypothyroidism
Role
of
triiodothyronine
in
pituitary
feedback
in
humans
Abstract
Text
A
change
in
the
formulation
of
the
levothyroxine
preparation
Synthroid
(Flint)
in
1982
prompted
us
to
reevaluate
the
replacement
dose
of
this
drug
in
19
patients
with
hypothyroidism
The
dose
was
titrated
monthly
until
thyrotropin
levels
became
normal
The
mean
replacement
dose
(+/-
SD)
was
112
+/-
19
micrograms
per
day
significantly
less
(P
less
than
0001)
than
the
dose
of
an
earlier
formulation--169
+/-
66
micrograms
per
day--used
in
a
similar
study
(Stock
JM
et
al
N
Engl
J
Med
1974
290529-33)
The
fractional
gastrointestinal
absorption
of
a
tablet
of
the
current
formulation
is
81
percent
considerably
higher
than
the
earlier
estimate
of
48
percent
Using
high-performance
liquid
chromatographic
analysis
we
found
that
the
current
tablet
contains
the
amount
of
thyroxine
stated
by
the
manufacturer
By
measuring
the
bioavailability
of
the
earlier
type
of
tablet
in
five
patients
we
inferred
that
the
strength
of
the
previous
tablet
had
been
overestimated
In
the
present
study
the
thyrotropin
levels
of
patients
on
replacement
therapy
returned
to
normal
when
serum
triiodothyronine
concentrations
were
not
significantly
different
from
those
of
controls
(122
vs
115
ng
per
deciliter
[187
vs
177
nmol
per
liter])
but
when
serum
thyroxine
levels
were
significantly
above
those
of
controls
(113
vs
87
micrograms
per
deciliter
[145
vs
112
nmol
per
liter]
P
less
than
0001)
These
findings
suggest
the
possibility
that
in
humans
serum
triiodothyronine
may
play
a
more
important
part
than
serum
thyroxine
in
regulating
the
serum
thyrotropin
concentration
