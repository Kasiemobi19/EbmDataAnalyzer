Statin-associated
myopathy
with
normal
creatine
kinase
levels
Abstract
Text
Muscle
symptoms
in
patients
who
are
treated
with
statins
and
have
normal
creatine
kinase
levels
are
not
well
understood
To
report
biopsy-confirmed
myopathy
and
normal
creatine
kinase
levels
associated
with
statin
use
Case
reports
from
preliminary
analysis
of
an
ongoing
clinical
trial
Clinical
research
center
in
a
community
hospital
Four
patients
with
muscle
symptoms
that
developed
during
statin
therapy
and
reversed
during
placebo
use

1)
Patients'
ability
to
identify
blinded
statin
therapy
and
2)
standard
measures
of
functional
capacity
and
muscle
strength
All
four
patients
repeatedly
distinguished
blinded
statin
therapy
from
placebo
Strength
testing
confirmed
weakness
during
statin
therapy
that
reversed
during
placebo
use
Muscle
biopsies
showed
evidence
of
mitochondrial
dysfunction
including
abnormally
increased
lipid
stores
fibers
that
did
not
stain
for
cytochrome
oxidase
activity
and
ragged
red
fibers
These
findings
reversed
in
the
three
patients
who
had
repeated
biopsy
when
they
were
not
receiving
statins
Creatine
kinase
levels
were
normal
in
all
four
patients
despite
the
presence
of
significant
myopathy
Some
patients
who
develop
muscle
symptoms
while
receiving
statin
therapy
have
demonstrable
weakness
and
histopathologic
findings
of
myopathy
despite
normal
serum
creatine
kinase
levels
