in
a
general

population
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
diagnostic
value
of
symptoms
signs
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
and
C
reactive
protein
for
acute
maxillary
sinusitisProspective
cohort
studyDanish
general
practice
in
cooperation
with
the
otorhinolaryngology
and
neuroradiology
department
at
Aalborg
County
Hospital174
patients
aged
18-65
years
who
were
suspected
by
the
general
practitioner
of
having
acute
maxillary
sinusitisThe
independent
association
of
symptoms
signs
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
and
concentration
of
C
reactive
protein
in
patients
with
acute
maxillary
sinusitis
defined
as
purulent
or
mucopurulent
antral
aspirateOnly
raised
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
(P
=
001)
and
raised
C
reactive
protein
(P
=
0007)
were
found
to
be
independently
associated
with
a
diagnosis
of
acute
maxillary
sinusitis
The
combination
of
the
two
variables
had
a
sensitivity
of
082
and
a
specificity
of
057Erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
and
C
reactive
protein
are
useful
diagnostic
criteria
for
acute
maxillary
sinusitis
