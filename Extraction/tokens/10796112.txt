Title
Dietary
regulation
for
'gestational
diabetes'
Abstract
Text
Impaired
glucose
metabolism
in
pregnancy
may
be
associated
with
adverse
pregnancy
outcomes
Primary
dietary
therapy
is
used
in
the
management
of
diabetes
including
gestational
diabetes
The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
primary
dietary
therapy
in
women
identified
as
having
gestational
diabetes
on
fetal
growth
and
neonatal
outcomes
I
searched
the
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group
trials
register
Randomised
trials
of
primary
dietary
therapy
compared
with
no
specific
treatment
in
pregnant
women
with
abnormal
glucose
tolerance
test
results
Trial
quality
was
assessed
Four
studies
involving
612
women
were
included
Trials
were
small
and
of
variable
quality
No
differences
were
detected
between
primary
dietary
therapy
and
no
primary
dietary
therapy
for
birthweight
greater
than
4000
grams
(odds
ratio
078
95%
confidence
interval
045
to
135)
or
caesarean
deliveries
(odds
ratio
097
95%
confidence
interval
065
to
144)
There
is
not
enough
evidence
to
evaluate
the
use
of
primary
dietary
therapy
for
women
who
show
impaired
glucose
metabolism
during
pregnancy
