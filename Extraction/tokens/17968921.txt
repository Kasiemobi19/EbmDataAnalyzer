Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
intraarticular
hylan
and
2
hyaluronic
acids
(HAs)
in
osteoarthritis
(OA)
of
the
knee
This
was
a
multicenter
patient-blind
randomized
controlled
trial
in
660
patients
with
symptomatic
knee
OA
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
1
cycle
of
3
intraarticular
injections
per
knee
of
1
of
3
preparations
a
high
molecular
weight
cross-linked
hylan
a
non-cross-linked
medium
molecular
weight
HA
of
avian
origin
or
a
non-cross-linked
low
molecular
weight
HA
of
bacterial
origin
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
the
change
in
the
Western
Ontario
and
McMaster
Universities
Osteoarthritis
Index
(WOMAC)
pain
score
at
6
months
Secondary
outcome
measures
included
local
adverse
events
(effusions
or
flares)
in
injected
knees
During
months
7-12
patients
were
offered
a
second
cycle
of
viscosupplementation

Pain
relief
was
similar
in
all
3
groups
The
difference
in
changes
between
baseline
and
6
months
between
hylan
and
the
combined
HAs
was
01
on
the
WOMAC
pain
score
(95%
confidence
interval
[95%
CI]
-02
03)
No
relevant
differences
were
observed
in
any
of
the
secondary
efficacy
outcomes
and
stratified
analyses
provided
no
evidence
for
differences
in
effects
across
different
patient
groups
There
was
a
trend
toward
more
local
adverse
events
in
the
hylan
group
than
in
the
HA
groups
during
the
first
cycle
(difference
22%
[95%
CI
-24
67])
and
this
trend
became
more
pronounced
during
the
second
cycle
(difference
64%
[95%
CI
06
122])
We
found
no
evidence
for
a
difference
in
efficacy
between
hylan
and
HAs
In
view
of
its
higher
costs
and
potential
for
more
local
adverse
events
we
see
no
rationale
for
the
continued
use
of
hylan
in
patients
with
knee
OA
