Pruritic
dermatoses
overview

etiology

therapy
Abstract
Text
This
review
begins
with
a
brief
survey
of
the
neurophysiology
and
neuroanatomy
of
pruritus
and
goes
on
to
describe
the
etiology
of
the
major
allergic
and
nonallergic
pruritic
disorders
The
etiology
of
pruritus
often
suggests
the
appropriate
treatment
For
example
urticaria
which
is
primarily
mediated
by
histamine
is
amenable
to
treatment
with
H1
antihistamines
Second-generation
nonsedating
antihistamines
appear
to
be
more
effective
than
sedating
antihistamines
perhaps
because
of
better
compliance
Other
systemic
pharmacologic
options
may
be
useful
in
nonhistamine-mediated
disorders
for
example
immunomodulators
for
inflammation-induced
pruritus
or
opiate
antagonists
for
atopic
dermatitis
Nonpharmacologic
measures
such
as
proper
skin
care
and
physical
modalities
such
as
phototherapy
or
acupuncture
may
also
be
helpful
