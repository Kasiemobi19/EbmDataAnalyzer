Psychophysiological
responses
to
repeated
acute
pain
stimulation
in
chronic
low
back
pain
patients
Abstract
Text
Psychophysiological
recordings
(electrodermal
activity
heart
rate
respiration
rate
and
frontalis
and
back
muscle
tension)
were
taken
in
chronic
low
back
pain
(CLBP)
patients
and
control
subjects
during
baseline
conditions
and
during
the
presentation
of
six
acute
pressure
pain
stimuli
No
baseline
differences
in
back
muscle
tension
between
CLBP
patients
and
controls
were
found
but
CLBP
patients
did
have
higher
baseline
electrodermal
activity
During
pain
stimulation
CLBP
patients
showed
larger
skin
conductance
reactions
than
controls
Also
the
CLBP
patient
group
showed
a
marked
increase
in
lumbar
muscle
tension
during
the
test
compared
to
baseline
whereas
the
EMG
level
of
the
control
group
remained
unchanged
This
increase
in
muscle
tension
seemed
to
be
more
related
to
the
postural
change
than
to
the
pain
stimulus
and
it
is
hypothesized
that
some
CLBP
patients
react
with
exaggerated
and
non-functional
back
muscle
contractions
to
slight
changes
in
posture
Contrary
to
expectation
no
differences
were
found
between
CLBP
patients
and
controls
in
physiological
habituation
after
repeating
the
pain
stimulus
Comparison
of
subjective
pain
ratings
and
psychophysiological
variables
showed
that
for
control
subjects
arousal
and
subjective
pain
were
related
For
CLBP
patients
there
was
no
such
clear
relationship
