Efficacy
and
safety
of
ezetimibe
added
to
ongoing
statin
therapy
for
treatment
of
patients
with
primary
hypercholesterolemia
Abstract
Text
Ezetimibe
is
a
lipid-lowering
drug
that
inhibits
the
intestinal
absorption
of
dietary
and
biliary
cholesterol
by
blocking
passage
across
the
intestinal
wall
The
efficacy
and
safety
of
adding
ezetimibe
to
ongoing
statin
therapy
in
patients
with
primary
hypercholesterolemia
was
evaluated
in
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
The
study
group
included
769
adults
(aged
>
or
=18
years)
with
primary
hypercholesterolemia
who
had
not
achieved
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
(NCEP)
Adult
Treatment
Panel
II
goals
with
dietary
alteration
and
statin
monotherapy
Patients
receiving
a
stable
dose
of
a
statin
for
>
or
=6
weeks
were
randomized
to
receive
concurrent
treatment
with
placebo
(n
=
390)
or
ezetimibe
(n
=
379)
10
mg/day
in
addition
to
continuing
their
open-label
statin
for
8
weeks
The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
the
percent
change
in
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
from
baseline
with
statin
monotherapy
to
end
point
after
intervention
(secondary
variables
high-density
lipoprotein
[HDL]
cholesterol
and
triglycerides)
Ongoing
statin
therapy
plus
ezetimibe
led
to
changes
of
-251%
for
LDL
cholesterol
(HDL
cholesterol
+27%
triglycerides
-140%)
compared
with
LDL
cholesterol
-37%
(p
<0001)
HDL
cholesterol
+10%
(p
<005)
and
triglycerides
-29%
(p
<0001)
for
placebo
added
to
ongoing
statin
therapy
Among
patients
not
at
LDL
cholesterol
goal
at
on-statin
baseline
715%
receiving
statin
plus
ezetimibe
versus
189%
receiving
statin
plus
placebo
reached
goal
at
end
point
(odds
ratio
237
p
<0001)
The
co-administration
of
statin
and
ezetimibe
was
generally
well
tolerated
Adding
ezetimibe
to
ongoing
statin
therapy
led
to
substantial
additional
reduction
in
LDL
cholesterol
levels
facilitating
attainment
of
NCEP
goals
Ezetimibe
offers
a
new
therapeutic
option
for
patients
receiving
statins
who
require
further
reduction
in
LDL
cholesterol
