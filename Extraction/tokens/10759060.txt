Hormonal

regimens

bleeding
Abstract
Text
Hormone
replacement
therapy
may
increase
the
quality
of
life
of
postmenopausal
women
Any
regimen
need
to
offer
long-term
endometrial
safety
It
is
a
standard
to
consider
the
co-administration
of
a
sequential
progestogen
when
estrogen
replacement
should
be
initiated
in
non-hysterectomized
women
It
is
almost
impossible
to
decide
which
combination
of
an
estrogen
and
a
progestogen
seems
to
be
optimal
as
individual
tolerance
of
HRT
may
very
well
limit
acceptability
despite
metabolic
benefits
and
proven
endometrial
safety
of
a
given
combination
Several
combinations
of
oral
and
transdermal
estradiol
or
conjugated
equine
estrogens
oral
progestogens
transdermal
norethisterone
acetate
and
levonorgestrel
and
intrauterine
levonorgestrel
may
achieve
endometrial
safety
It
is
noteworthy
that
there
is
no
uniform
correlation
between
the
timing
of
onset
of
bleeding
induced
by
any
sequential
estrogen
and
progestogen
replacement
and
a
certain
pattern
of
histology
Therefore
although
it
is
likely
there
is
no
absolute
reassurance
that
regular
bleeding
on
or
after
day
11
of
progestogen
administration
rules
out
abnormal
histopathology
Transvaginal
sonography
seems
not
to
be
of
pivotal
importance
to
screen
asymptomatic
women
on
replacement
therapy
for
detection
of
serious
abnormal
endometrial
findings
such
as
hyperplasia
and
endometrial
cancer
Continuous
combined
hormone
replacement
therapy
or
the
use
of
tibolone
may
be
an
alternative
in
postmenopausal
women
who
do
not
want
any
uterine
bleedings
after
menopause
However
spottings
or
bleedings
most
often
occur
at
the
beginning
of
treatment
Vaginal
administration
of
estriol
and
estradiol
for
urogenital
symptoms
of
estrogen
deficiency
may
stimulate
the
endometrium
unintentionally
Available
data
suggest
that
use
of
oral
estriol
may
be
associated
with
endometrial
hyperplasia
and
endometrial
carcinoma
relatively
more
often
compared
to
sequential
HRT
Raloxifene
a
benzothiophene
derivative
acting
as
a
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulator
approved
for
prevention
of
vertebral
osteoporosis
rarely
causes
uterine
bleeding
There
is
no
ideal
therapy
available
to
suit
women
looking
for
a
permanently
bleed-free
hormonal
replacement
therapy
today
