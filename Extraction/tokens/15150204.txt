Prevention
of
contrast-induced

with
sodium

a
randomized

trial
Abstract
Text
Contrast-induced
nephropathy
remains
a
common
complication
of
radiographic
procedures
Pretreatment
with
sodium
bicarbonate
is
more
protective
than
sodium
chloride
in
animal
models
of
acute
ischemic
renal
failure
Acute
renal
failure
from
both
ischemia
and
contrast
are
postulated
to
occur
from
free-radical
injury
However
no
studies
in
humans
or
animals
have
evaluated
the
efficacy
of
sodium
bicarbonate
for
prophylaxis
against
contrast-induced
nephropathy
To
examine
the
efficacy
of
sodium
bicarbonate
compared
with
sodium
chloride
for
preventive
hydration
before
and
after
radiographic
contrast
A
prospective
single-center
randomized
trial
conducted
from
September
16
2002
to
June
17
2003
of
119
patients
with
stable
serum
creatinine
levels
of
at
least
11
mg/dL
(>
or
=972
micromol/L)
who
were
randomized
to
receive
a
154-mEq/L
infusion
of
either
sodium
chloride
(n
=
59)
or
sodium
bicarbonate
(n
=
60)
before
and
after
iopamidol
administration
(370
mg
iodine/mL)
Serum
creatinine
levels
were
measured
at
baseline
and
1
and
2
days
after
contrast
Patients
received
154
mEq/L
of
either
sodium
chloride
or
sodium
bicarbonate
as
a
bolus
of
3
mL/kg
per
hour
for
1
hour
before
iopamidol
contrast
followed
by
an
infusion
of
1
mL/kg
per
hour
for
6
hours
after
the
procedure
Contrast-induced
nephropathy
defined
as
an
increase
of
25%
or
more
in
serum
creatinine
within
2
days
of
contrast
There
were
no
significant
group
differences
in
age
sex
incidence
of
diabetes
mellitus
ethnicity
or
contrast
volume
Baseline
serum
creatinine
was
slightly
higher
but
not
statistically
different
in
patients
receiving
sodium
bicarbonate
treatment
(mean
[SD]
171
[042]
mg/dL
[1512
[371]
micromol/L]
for
sodium
chloride
and
189
[069]
mg/dL
[1671
[610]
micromol/L]
for
sodium
bicarbonate

The
primary
end
point
of
contrast-induced
nephropathy
occurred
in
8
patients
(136%)
infused
with
sodium
chloride
but
in
only
1
(17%)
of
those
receiving
sodium
bicarbonate
(mean
difference
119%
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
26%-212%
P
=02)
A
follow-up
registry
of
191
consecutive
patients
receiving
prophylactic
sodium
bicarbonate
and
meeting
the
same
inclusion
criteria
as
the
study
resulted
in
3
cases
of
contrast-induced
nephropathy
(16%
95%
CI
0%-34%)
Hydration
with
sodium
bicarbonate
before
contrast
exposure
is
more
effective
than
hydration
with
sodium
chloride
for
prophylaxis
of
contrast-induced
renal
failure
