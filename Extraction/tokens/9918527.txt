Abstract
Text
Surgical
correction
of
mitral
regurgitation
in
patients
with
no
or
mild
symptoms
remains
controversial
particularly
because
the
impact
of
preoperative
symptoms
on
postoperative
outcome
is
unknown
The
long-term
outcome
of
478
patients
with
organic
mitral
regurgitation
(199
in
NYHA
functional
class
I/II
and
279
in
class
III/IV
before
surgery)
operated
on
between
1984
and
1991
was
analyzed
In
patients
in
NYHA
class
I/II
before
surgery
compared
with
those
in
class
III/IV
postoperative
long-term
survival
was
higher
(at
10
years
76+/-5%
versus
48+/-4%
P<00001)
with
lower
operative
mortality
(05%
versus
54%
P=0003)
and
better
late
survival
(P<00001)
Comparison
of
observed
and
expected
survival
showed
identical
curves
in
patients
in
class
I/II
before
surgery
(P=018)
whereas
excess
mortality
was
observed
in
patients
in
class
III/IV
before
surgery
(P<00001)
Excess
mortality
associated
with
severe
symptoms
was
also
confirmed
in
all
subgroups
(all
P<0003)
and
in
multivariate
analysis
(P=00036
adjusted
hazard
ratio
[95%
CI]
181
[121
to
270])
In
patients
with
organic
mitral
regurgitation
preoperative
functional
class
III/IV
symptoms
are
associated
with
excess
short-
and
long-term
postoperative
mortality
independently
of
all
baseline
characteristics
These
data
should
lead
to
consideration
of
surgical
correction
of
severe
organic
mitral
regurgitation
when
no
or
minimal
symptoms
are
present
in
patients
at
low
operative
risk
especially
if
repair
is
feasible
