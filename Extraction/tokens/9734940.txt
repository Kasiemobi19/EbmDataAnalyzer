Randomised
trial
of
growth
hormone
in
short
normal
girls
Abstract
Text
There
are
few
data
on
the
long-term
outcome
of
growth-hormone
treatment
in
short
normal
children
We
assessed
the
impact
of
growth-hormone
treatment
on
pubertal
development
and
near-final
height
in
girls
In
a
randomised
controlled
trial
we
studied
ten
girls
with
a
mean
age
of
807
years
and
height
2
SDs
or
more
below
the
mean
for
their
age
and
eight
short
untreated
controls
matched
for
age
and
20
short
untreated
girls
who
did
not
give
consent
for
randomisation
The
girls
received
either
30
IU/m2
somatropin
per
week
as
daily
subcutaneous
injections
or
no
treatment
We
assessed
pubertal
staging
and
height
gain
every
6
months
Eight
treated
girls
completed
a
mean
of
62
years'
therapy
By
a
mean
age
of
164
years
their
mean
height
SD
score
had
changed
significantly
from
-242
to
-114
(p=0008)
and
they
were
on
average
75
cm
taller
than
the
girls
in
the
control
group
(height
SD
scores
did
not
change
significantly
from
-255)
and
60
cm
taller
than
the
non-consent
group
The
timing
of
each
pubertal
stage
and
the
age
and
amplitude
of
peak
height
velocity
were
similar
for
all
groups
Growth-hormone
therapy
effectively
increased
height
SD
score
among
short
normal
girls
started
on
treatment
in
early
to
mid
childhood
with
no
untoward
effect
on
pubertal
progression
