Abstract
Text
This
study
evaluated
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
rosiglitazone
monotherapy
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
After
a
4-week
placebo
run-in
period
493
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
were
randomized
to
receive
rosiglitazone
[2
or
4
mg
twice
daily
(bd)]
or
placebo
for
26
weeks
The
primary
end
point
was
change
in
hemoglobin
A(1c)
other
variables
assessed
included
fasting
plasma
glucose
fructosamine
endogenous
insulin
secretion
urinary
albumin
excretion
serum
lipids
and
adverse
events
Rosiglitazone
(2
and
4
mg
bd)
decreased
mean
hemoglobin
A(1c)
relative
to
placebo
by
12
and
15
percentage
points
respectively
and
reduced
fasting
plasma
glucose
concentrations
relative
to
placebo
by
322
and
422
mmol/L
respectively
Fasting
plasma
insulin
and
insulin
precursor
molecules
decreased
significantly
Homeostasis
model
assessment
estimates
indicate
that
rosiglitazone
(2
and
4
mg
bd)
reduced
insulin
resistance
by
160%
and
246%
respectively
and
improved
ss-cell
function
over
baseline
by
495%
and
600%
respectively
Urinary
albumin
excretion
decreased
significantly
in
the
rosiglitazone
(4
mg
bd)
group
There
was
no
increase
in
adverse
events
with
rosiglitazone
In
the
short-term
rosiglitazone
is
an
insulin
sensitizer
that
is
effective
and
safe
as
monotherapy
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
who
are
inadequately
controlled
by
lifestyle
interventions
