Appropriateness

Lyme

serologic
testing
Abstract
Text
Although
rapid
diagnosis
of
Lyme
disease
is
essential
for
effective
treatment
there
is
concern
about
inappropriate
testing
We
conducted
a
prospective
cross-sectional
survey
of
clinicians
to
assess
the
use
and
appropriateness
of
Lyme
disease
serologic
tests
(LDSTs)
LDSTs
performed
at
2
large
Wisconsin
reference
laboratories
were
systematically
sampled
for
12
consecutive
months
A
standardized
questionnaire
was
used
to
gather
data
about
the
submitting
clinician
and
the
patient
tested
Tests
were
categorized
as
appropriate
inappropriate
or
discretionary
and
associations
were
assessed
using
logistic
regression
analysis
A
test
was
defined
as
inappropriate
if
the
patient
was
asymptomatic
had
erythema
migrans
or
was
treated
empirically
or
if
the
test
was
ordered
as
a
test
of
cure
We
surveyed
303
clinicians
regarding
356
LDSTs
72
tests
(20%)
were
appropriate
95
(27%)
were
inappropriate
and
189
(53%)
were
discretionary
Tests
were
more
likely
to
be
inappropriate
if
they
were
ordered
by
an
emergency
or
urgent
care
physician
compared
with
other
specialists
(adjusted
odds
ratio

or
if
preceded
by
a
known
tick
bite
(AOR
68
95%
CI
26-176)
The
patient
rather
than
the
clinician
requested
26%
of
tests
which
were
more
likely
to
be
inappropriate
than
clinician-requested
tests
(crude
odds
ratio
[COR]
58
95%
CI
25-136)
Tests
were
more
likely
to
be
patient-requested
if
they
were
ordered
by
an
internist
(AOR
26
95%
CI
14-48)
or
if
the
patient
was
>
or
=40
years
old
(AOR
22
95%
CI
13-39)
Many
LDSTs
are
ordered
inappropriately
often
influenced
by
patient
demand
Education
of
clinicians
and
patients
about
testing
indications
and
contraindications
is
needed
to
reduce
the
number
of
inappropriate
LDSTs
