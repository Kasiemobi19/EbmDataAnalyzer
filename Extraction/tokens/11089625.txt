a

and
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
To
systematically
review
studies
of
male
circumcision
and
the
risk
of
HIV-1
infection
in
men
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
and
to
summarize
the
findings
in
a
meta-analysis
A
meta-analysis
of
observational
studies
A
systematic
literature
review
was
carried
out
of
studies
published
up
to
April
1999
that
included
circumcision
as
a
risk
factor
for
HIV-1
infection
among
men
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
A
random
effects
meta-analysis
was
used
to
calculate
a
pooled
relative
risk
(RR)
and
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
for
all
studies
combined
and
stratified
by
type
of
study
population
Further
analyses
were
conducted
among
those
studies
that
adjusted
for
potential
confounding
factors
Twenty-seven
studies
were
included
Of
these
21
showed
a
reduced
risk
of
HIV
among
circumcised
men
being
approximately
half
that
in
uncircumcised
men
(crude
RR
=
052
CI
040-068)
In
15
studies
that
adjusted
for
potential
confounding
factors
the
association
was
even
stronger
(adjusted
RR
=
042
CI
034-054)
The
association
was
stronger
among
men
at
high
risk
of
HIV
(crude
RR
=
027
adjusted
RR
=
029
CI
020-041)
than
among
men
in
general
populations
(crude
RR
=
093
adjusted
RR
=
056
CI
044-070)
Male
circumcision
is
associated
with
a
significantly
reduced
risk
of
HIV
infection
among
men
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
particularly
those
at
high
risk
of
HIV
These
results
suggest
that
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
acceptability
and
feasibility
of
providing
safe
services
for
male
circumcision
as
an
additional
HIV
prevention
strategy
in
areas
of
Africa
where
men
are
not
traditionally
circumcised
