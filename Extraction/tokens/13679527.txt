A
comparison
of
two
intensities
of
warfarin
for
the
prevention
of
recurrent
thrombosis
in
patients
with
the
antiphospholipid
antibody
syndrome
Abstract
Text
Many
patients
with
the
antiphospholipid
antibody
syndrome
and
recurrent
thrombosis
receive
doses
of
warfarin
adjusted
to
achieve
an
international
normalized
ratio
(INR)
of
more
than
30
However
there
are
no
prospective
data
to
support
this
approach
to
thromboprophylaxis
We
performed
a
randomized
double-blind
trial
in
which
patients
with
antiphospholipid
antibodies
and
previous
thrombosis
were
assigned
to
receive
enough
warfarin
to
achieve
an
INR
of
20
to
30
(moderate
intensity)
or
31
to
40
(high
intensity)
Our
objective
was
to
show
that
high-intensity
warfarin
was
more
effective
in
preventing
thrombosis
than
moderate-intensity
warfarin
A
total
of
114
patients
were
enrolled
in
the
study
and
followed
for
a
mean
of
27
years
Recurrent
thrombosis
occurred
in
6
of
56
patients
(107
percent)
assigned
to
receive
high-intensity
warfarin
and
in
2
of
58
patients
(34
percent)
assigned
to
receive
moderate-intensity
warfarin
(hazard
ratio
for
the
high-intensity
group
31
95
percent
confidence
interval
06
to
150)
Major
bleeding
occurred
in
three
patients
assigned
to
receive
high-intensity
warfarin
and
four
patients
assigned
to
receive
moderate-intensity
warfarin
(hazard
ratio
10
95
percent
confidence
interval
02
to
48)
High-intensity
warfarin
was
not
superior
to
moderate-intensity
warfarin
for
thromboprophylaxis
in
patients
with
antiphospholipid
antibodies
and
previous
thrombosis
The
low
rate
of
recurrent
thrombosis
among
patients
in
whom
the
target
INR
was
20
to
30
suggests
that
moderate-intensity
warfarin
is
appropriate
for
patients
with
the
antiphospholipid
antibody
syndrome
