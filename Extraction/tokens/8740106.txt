Abstract
Text
Recently
two
commercial
oral
nystatin
gels
have
been
marketed
in
Germany
(Candio-Hermal
Hermal
Lederlind
Lederle)
In
a
prospective
open
randomized
multicentre
study
involving
12
paediatricians
in
private
practice
Candio-Hermal
and
Lederlind
were
compared
with
miconazole
oral
gel
(Daktar
Janssen)
in
95
infants
with
oral
thrush
(candidosis)
Oral
and
rectal
swabs
were
taken
on
days
0
and
14
Treatment
duration
varied
according
to
the
amount
of
drug
contained
in
one
tube
(Candio-Hermal
10
days
Lederlind
14
days
Daktar
8
days)
On
day
14
clinical
cure
was
observed
in
23
of
27
infants
treated
with
Daktar
(851%)
in
15
of
35
infants
treated
with
Candio-Hermal
(428%
p
<
00007)
and
in
16
of
33
infants
treated
with
Lederlind
(485%
p
<
0004)
Clinical
relapses
were
observed
in
15
patients
(Candio-Hermal
n
=
9
Lederlind
n
=
6)
The
overall
oral
mycologic
cure
rate
was
significantly
higher
with
Daktar
(296%)
and
Candio-Hermal
(200%)
than
with
Lederlind
(30%
p
<
0005
and
<
003
respectively)
It
can
be
concluded
that
Daktar
oral
gel
is
significantly
more
effective
than
Candio-Hermal
and
Lederlind
in
curing
oral
thrush
in
infants
