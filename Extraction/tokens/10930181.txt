Prediction
of
stroke
by
ambulatory
blood
pressure
monitoring
versus
screening
blood
pressure
measurements
in
a
general
population
the
Ohasama
study
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
association
between
24
h
daytime
and
night-time
ambulatory
blood
pressures
and
first
symptomatic
stroke
to
compare
their
predictive
powers
for
stroke
with
that
of
casual
(screening)
blood
pressure
and
to
compare
the
predictive
power
for
stroke
between
daytime
and
night-time
blood
pressures
in
a
general
population
in
Ohasama
Japan
A
prospective
cohort
study
We
obtained
ambulatory
blood
pressure
on
1464
subjects
aged
>
or
=
40
years
without
history
of
symptomatic
stroke
then
followed-up
their
stroke-free
survival
There
were
74
first
symptomatic
stroke
during
the
follow-up
period
(mean
=
64
years)
The
prognostic
significance
of
blood
pressure
for
stroke
risk
was
examined
by
a
Cox
proportional
hazards
regression
model
adjusted
for
possible
confounding
factors
The
non-parametric
and
parametric
analysis
indicated
that
24-h
daytime
and
night-time
ambulatory
blood
pressures
were
linearly
related
with
stroke
risk
The
likelihood
ratio
analysis
demonstrated
that
these
ambulatory
blood
pressures
were
significantly
better
related
to
stroke
risk
than
did
screening
blood
pressure
and
that
daytime
blood
pressure
better
predicted
stroke
risk
than
did
night-time
blood
pressure
The
present
study
which
prospectively
investigated
the
relation
between
ambulatory
blood
pressure
and
first
symptomatic
stroke
risk
in
a
general
population
demonstrated
that
(i)
ambulatory
blood
pressure
values
were
linearly
related
to
stroke
risk
(ii)
ambulatory
blood
pressures
had
the
stronger
predictive
power
for
stroke
risk
than
did
screening
blood
pressure
and
(iii)
daytime
blood
pressure
better
related
to
stroke
risk
than
did
night-time
blood
pressure
