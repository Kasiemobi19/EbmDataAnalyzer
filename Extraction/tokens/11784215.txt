The
effect
of
antidepressant
treatment
on
chronic
back
pain
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Back
pain
is
one
of
the
most
common
problems
in
primary
care
Antidepressant
medication
is
often
prescribed
especially
for
chronic
back
discomfort
to
alleviate
pain
and
restore
the
patient's
ability
to
conduct
activities
of
daily
living
To
assess
the
efficacy
of
antidepressants
in
treating
back
pain
in
adults
We
searched
the
MEDLINE
(1966-2000)
PsycLit
Cinhal
EMBASE
AIDSLINE
HealthSTAR
CANCERLIT
the
Cochrane
Library
(clinical
trials
registry
and
the
Database
of
Systematic
Reviews)
Micromedex
and
Federal
Research
in
Progress
databases
and
references
of
reviewed
articles
Included
articles
were
written
in
English
and
dealt
with
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
of
antidepressant
medication
use
among
adults
with
chronic
back
pain
Two
reviewers
abstracted
data
independently
Two
continuous
outcomes
change
in
back
pain
severity
and
ability
to
perform
activities
of
daily
living
were
measured
Study
quality
was
assessed
with
the
methods
used
by
Jadad
and
colleagues
and
data
were
synthesized
using
a
random-effects
model
Nine
randomized
controlled
trials
with
10
treatment
arms
and
504
patients
were
included
Seven
treatment
arms
included
patients
with
major
depression
Patients
had
chronic
back
pain
averaging
104
years
Patients
treated
with
antidepressants
were
more
likely
to
improve
in
pain
severity
than
those
taking
placebo
(standardized
mean
difference
041
95%
confidence
interval
022-061)
but
not
in
activities
of
daily
living
(standardized
mean
difference
024
95%
confidence
interval
-021-069)
Patients
treated
with
antidepressants
experienced
more
adverse
effects
(22%
vs
14%
P
=01)
than
those
receiving
placebo
Antidepressants
are
more
effective
than
placebo
in
reducing
pain
severity
but
not
functional
status
in
chronic
back
pain
