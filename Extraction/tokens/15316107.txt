Treatment

in
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
To
review
the
literature
for
treatment
of
migraine
headaches
with
sumatriptan
during
pregnancy
Studies
and
reports
were
located
in
International
Pharmaceutical
Abstracts
(1970-September
2003)
and
MEDLINE
(1966-week
3
September
2003)
Research
has
been
performed
to
evaluate
the
risk
of
teratogenesis
after
sumatriptan
exposure
in
pregnant
patients
Data
have
been
collected
in
areas
including
placental
transmission
of
sumatriptan
prospective
pregnancy
registries
open-labeled
and
controlled
prospective
studies
and
a
retrospective
prescription-linked
study
As
of
August
6
2004
no
randomized
controlled
trials
have
been
conducted
with
exposure
to
sumatriptan
during
pregnancy
Teratogenesis
occurs
in
approximately
150
000
births
per
year
which
represents
an
incidence
of
3-5%
Available
literature
to
date
indicates
that
exposure
to
sumatriptan
during
pregnancy
has
no
additional
risk
of
birth
defects
compared
with
the
incidence
in
the
general
population
