Title
Efficacy
of
topical
antibiotic
therapy
in
acute
conjunctivitis
in
children
Abstract
Text
We
studied
102
children
aged
1
month
to
18
years
in
a
randomized
double-blind
trial
designed
to
determine
both
the
natural
history
of
bacterial
conjunctivitis
and
whether
topical
antibiotic
therapy
is
beneficial
Affected
eyes
were
treated
four
times
a
day
for
7
days
with
drug
(polymyxin-bacitracin
ophthalmic
ointment)
or
placebo
Eighty-four
patients
had
proved
bacterial
conjunctivitis
(Haemophilus
influenzae
61
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
22
both
one)
66
of
these
received
only
topical
therapy
By
3
to
5
days
21
of
34
(62%)
patients
receiving
topical
antibiotic
were
clinically
cured
whereas
only
nine
of
32
(28%)
patients
given
placebo
were
cured
(P
less
than
002)
By
8
to
10
days
31
(91%)
of
the
patients
given
antibiotic
and
23
(72%)
of
the
placebo
group
were
cured
(P
=
NS)
The
bacterial
pathogen
was
eradicated
by
day
3
to
5
in
71%
and
by
day
8
to
10
in
79%
of
patients
given
antibiotic
compared
to
19%
and
31%
of
the
placebo
group
(P
less
than
0001)
Acute
bacterial
conjunctivitis
is
a
self-limited
disease
but
topical
antibiotic
therapy
with
polymyxin-bacitracin
shortens
the
duration
of
clinical
disease
and
enhances
eradication
of
the
causative
organism
from
the
conjunctiva
