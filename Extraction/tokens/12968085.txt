Effect
of
intensity
of
oral
anticoagulation
on
stroke
severity
and
mortality
in
atrial
fibrillation
Abstract
Text
The
incidence
of
stroke
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
is
greatly
reduced
by
oral
anticoagulation
with
the
full
effect
seen
at
international
normalized
ratio
(INR)
values
of
20
or
greater
The
effect
of
the
intensity
of
oral
anticoagulation
on
the
severity
of
atrial
fibrillation-related
stroke
is
not
known
but
is
central
to
the
choice
of
the
target
INR
We
studied
incident
ischemic
strokes
in
a
cohort
of
13559
patients
with
nonvalvular
atrial
fibrillation
Strokes
were
identified
through
hospitalization
data
bases
and
validated
on
the
basis
of
medical
records
which
also
provided
information
on
the
use
of
warfarin
or
aspirin
the
INR
at
admission
and
coexisting
illnesses
The
severity
of
stroke
was
graded
according
to
a
modified
Rankin
scale
Thirty-day
mortality
was
ascertained
from
hospitalization
and
mortality
files
Of
596
ischemic
strokes
32
percent
occurred
during
warfarin
therapy
27
percent
during
aspirin
therapy
and
42
percent
during
neither
type
of
therapy
Among
patients
who
were
taking
warfarin
an
INR
of
less
than
20
at
admission
as
compared
with
an
INR
of
20
or
greater
independently
increased
the
odds
of
a
severe
stroke
in
a
proportional-odds
logistic-regression
model
(odds
ratio
19
95
percent
confidence
interval
11
to
34)
across
three
severity
categories
and
the
risk
of
death
within
30
days
(hazard
ratio
34
95
percent
confidence
interval
11
to
101)
An
INR
of
15
to
19
at
admission
was
associated
with
a
mortality
rate
similar
to
that
for
an
INR
of
less
than
15
(18
percent
and
15
percent
respectively)
The
30-day
mortality
rate
among
patients
who
were
taking
aspirin
at
the
time
of
the
stroke
was
similar
to
that
among
patients
who
were
taking
warfarin
and
who
had
an
INR
of
less
than
20
Among
patients
with
nonvalvular
atrial
fibrillation
anticoagulation
that
results
in
an
INR
of
20
or
greater
reduces
not
only
the
frequency
of
ischemic
stroke
but
also
its
severity
and
the
risk
of
death
from
stroke
Our
findings
provide
further
evidence
against
the
use
of
lower
INR
target
levels
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
