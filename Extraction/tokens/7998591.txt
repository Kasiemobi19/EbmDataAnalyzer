Title
Defining
the
perimenopause
for
application
in
epidemiologic
investigations
Abstract
Text
The
authors
present
a
method
for
defining
the
inception
of
perimenopause
that
is
based
on
self-reported
data
The
study
sample
(n
=
1550)
was
obtained
from
a
5-year
longitudinal
study
of
2569
Massachusetts
women
aged
45-55
years
that
began
in
1981
The
definition
was
derived
from
the
ability
of
responses
to
questions
concerning
timing
of
the
last
menstrual
period
menstrual
regularity
and
presence
of
menopausal
symptoms
(hot
flashes/sweats)
to
predict
menopause
3
years
later
The
two
items
that
best
defined
the
inception
of
perimenopause
were
3-11
months
of
amenorrhea
and
increased
menstrual
irregularity
for
those
without
amenorrhea
This
definition
can
easily
be
used
in
large
epidemiologic
investigations
