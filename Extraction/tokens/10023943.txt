The

Insufficiency
Bisoprolol
Study
II
(CIBIS-II)
a
randomised
trial
Abstract
Text
In
patients
with
heart
failure
beta-blockade
has
improved
morbidity
and
left-ventricular
function
but
the
impact
on
survival
is
uncertain
We
investigated
the
efficacy
of
bisoprolol
a
beta1
selective
adrenoceptor
blocker
in
decreasing
all-cause
mortality
in
chronic
heart
failure
In
a
multicentre
double-blind
randomised
placebo-controlled
trial
in
Europe
we
enrolled
2647
symptomatic
patients
in
New
York
Heart
Association
class
III
or
IV
with
left-ventricular
ejection
fraction
of
35%
or
less
receiving
standard
therapy
with
diuretics
and
inhibitors
of
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
We
randomly
assigned
patients
bisoprolol
125
mg
(n=1327)
or
placebo
(n=1320)
daily
the
drug
being
progressively
increased
to
a
maximum
of
10
mg
per
day
Patients
were
followed
up
for
a
mean
of
13
years
Analysis
was
by
intention
to
treat
CIBIS-II
was
stopped
early
after
the
second
interim
analysis
because
bisoprolol
showed
a
significant
mortality
benefit
All-cause
mortality
was
significantly
lower
with
bisoprolol
than
on
placebo
(156
[118%]
vs
228
[173%]
deaths
with
a
hazard
ratio
of
066
(95%
CI
054-081
p<00001)
There
were
significantly
fewer
sudden
deaths
among
patients
on
bisoprolol
than
in
those
on
placebo
(48
[36%]
vs
83
[63%]
deaths)
with
a
hazard
ratio
of
056
(039-080
p=00011)
Treatment
effects
were
independent
of
the
severity
or
cause
of
heart
failure
Beta-blocker
therapy
had
benefits
for
survival
in
stable
heart-failure
patients
Results
should
not
however
be
extrapolated
to
patients
with
severe
class
IV
symptoms
and
recent
instability
because
safety
and
efficacy
has
not
been
established
in
these
patients
