Smokeless
tobacco
abstinence
effects
and
nicotine
gum
dose
Abstract
Text
There
were
two
experiments
on
abstinence
from
smokeless
tobacco
The
purpose
of
the
first
experiment
was
to
determine
abstinence
effects
from
smokeless
tobacco
The
purpose
of
the
second
experiment
was
to
examine
the
effects
of
different
doses
of
nicotine
gum
on
smokeless
tobacco
abstinence
effects
The
subjects
were
male
Copenhagen
smokeless
tobacco
users
who
underwent
3
days
of
baseline
measurement
while
continuing
to
use
smokeless
tobacco
ad
libitum
and
5
days
of
the
experimental
condition
In
the
first
experiment
the
subjects
were
assigned
randomly
to
one
of
two
groups
and
compared
continuous
smokeless
tobacco
users
(n
=
10)
and
deprivation
plus
no
nicotine
gum
(n
=
10)
In
the
second
experiment
subjects
were
assigned
randomly
and
in
a
double-blind
fashion
to
one
of
three
groups
and
compared
(1)
deprivation
plus
0
mg
nicotine
gum
(n
=
20)
(2)
deprivation
plus
2
mg
nicotine
gum
(n
=
20)
and
(3)
deprivation
plus
4
mg
nicotine
gum
(n
=
20)
The
first
experiment
showed
significant
increases
upon
abstinence
for
the
following
variables
(1)
craving
(2)
difficulty
concentrating
(3)
restlessness
(4)
excessive
hunger
(5)
eating
(6)
reaction
time
(7)
variability
of
reaction
time
and
(8)
total
withdrawal
scores
for
both
the
self-rated
and
the
observer-rated
forms
The
second
experiment
showed
that
nicotine
gum
failed
to
significantly
reduce
smokeless
tobacco
abstinence
effects
although
those
with
high
cotinine
levels
may
receive
some
benefit
from
nicotine
gum
