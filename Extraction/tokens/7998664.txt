Budesonide
and
terfenadine
separately
and
in
combination
in
the
treatment
of
hay
fever
Abstract
Text
While
hay
fever
is
a
very
common
experience
its
treatment
in
primary
care
setting
has
been
little
reported
in
controlled
studies
This
study
sought
to
evaluate
the
patient's
assessment
of
efficacy
of
an
intranasal
steroid
spray
(budesonide)
alone
or
in
combination
with
an
antihistamine
(terfenadine)
against
terfenadine
alone
or
placebo
alone
A
double-blind
parallel
group
placebo-controlled
trial
design
was
used
comparing
the
four
groups
Each
group
used
an
active
or
placebo
spray
and
active
or
placebo
tablets
Symptom
scores
were
recorded
daily
in
diaries
over
a
21-day
period
Overall
assessment
of
efficacy
by
the
106
patients
was
significantly
greater
(P
<
05)
for
budesonide
versus
terfenadine
or
placebo
alone
There
was
a
40%
placebo
response
Budesonide
was
more
effective
than
terfenadine
for
all
individual
symptom
scores
particularly
nasal
blockage
against
which
terfenadine
was
ineffective
Adverse
effects
were
mild
and
transient
for
all
groups
Budesonide
alone
is
a
highly
effective
treatment
for
hay
fever
with
few
side
effects
