Abstract
Text
to
study
the
effect
of
birth
centre
care
on
the
duration
of
breast
feeding
breast
feeding
complications
and
women's
experiences
of
breast
feeding
randomised
controlled
trial
in-hospital
birth
centre
at
South
Hospital
Stockholm
and
standard
obstetric
care
in
the
Greater
Stockholm
area
1230
women
with
expected
date
of
birth
between
October
1989
and
February
1992
interested
in
participating
in
a
birth
centre
trial
and
meeting
medical
low-risk
criteria
617
women
were
allocated
to
the
experimental
group
offered
birth
centre
care
(EG)
and
613
to
the
control
group
offered
standard
obstetric
care
(CG)
duration
of
breast
feeding
breast
feeding
complications
such
as
sore
nipples
engorgement
milk
stasis
and
mastitis
and
women's
experiences
of
breast
feeding
no
difference
was
found
between
EG
and
CG
in
the
duration
of
breast
feeding
Ninety-three
per
cent
in
both
groups
were
breast
feeding
exclusively
two
months
post
partum
The
average
number
of
months
of
breast
feeding
exclusively
or
partly
when
investigated
one
year
after
the
birth
was
86
in
EG
and
85
in
CG
No
difference
was
observed
in
women's
experiences
of
breast
feeding
but
rather
more
women
in
EG
than
in
CG
reported
sore
nipples
36%
and
30%
respectively
(p
=
003)
and
milk
stasis
26%
and
19%
respectively
(p
=
0002)
birth
centre
care
had
no
effect
on
the
duration
of
breast
feeding
or
on
women's
experiences
of
breast
feeding
Prenatal
attitudes
were
probably
more
significant
predictors
of
these
outcomes
than
differences
in
the
two
modes
of
maternity
care
in
this
population
of
highly
breast
feeding-motivated
women
The
larger
proportion
of
sore
nipples
and
milk
stasis
in
the
EG
might
have
been
due
to
earlier
discharge
or
to
midwives
less
skilled
in
assisting
with
breast
feeding
at
the
birth
centre
than
in
the
postpartum
wards
