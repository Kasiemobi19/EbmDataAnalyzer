Refractory
condylomata
acuminata
a
controlled
clinical
trial
of
carbon
dioxide
laser
versus
conventional
surgical
treatment
Abstract
Text
Uncontrolled
trials
indicate
that
treatment
of
condylomata
acuminata
with
the
carbon
dioxide
laser
is
effective
and
probably
superior
to
conventional
surgical
treatment
We
performed
a
controlled
study
of
refractory
condylomata
acuminata
to
clarify
whether
this
is
the
case
In
this
randomised
trial
21
patients
were
treated
with
the
carbon
dioxide
laser
and
22
by
conventional
surgery
after
having
been
treated
with
podophyllin
for
an
average
of
33
and
35
weeks
respectively
Five
and
seven
patients
respectively
had
previously
required
additional
treatment
such
as
an
operation
The
treatment
schedule
was
equally
effective
for
both
groups
of
patients
No
difference
between
the
two
groups
was
seen
in
numbers
of
recurrences
postoperative
pain
healing
time
and
rate
of
scar
formation
(p
greater
than
01-02)
Treatment
of
recalcitrant
condylomata
acuminata
with
the
carbon
dioxide
laser
did
not
offer
any
advantages
over
traditional
surgery
including
electrocautery
