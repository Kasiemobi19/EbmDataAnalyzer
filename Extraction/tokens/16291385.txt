How
surgeons
disclose
medical
errors
to
patients
a
study
using
standardized
patients
Abstract
Text
Calls
are
increasing
for
physicians
to
disclose
harmful
medical
errors
to
patients
but
little
is
known
about
how
physicians
perform
this
challenging
task
For
surgeons
communication
about
errors
is
particularly
important
since
surgical
errors
can
have
devastating
consequences
Our
objective
was
to
explore
how
surgeons
disclose
medical
errors
using
standardized
patients
Thirty
academic
surgeons
participated
in
the
study
Each
surgeon
discussed
2
of
3
error
scenarios
(wrong-side
lumpectomy
retained
surgical
sponge
and
hyperkalemia-induced
arrhythmia)
with
standardized
patients
yielding
a
total
of
60
encounters
Each
encounter
was
scored
by
using
a
scale
developed
to
rate
5
communication
elements
of
effective
error
disclosure
Half
of
the
encounters
took
place
face-to-face
the
remainder
occurred
by
videoconference
Surgeons
were
rated
highest
on
their
ability
to
explain
the
medical
facts
about
the
error
(mean
scores
for
the
3
scenarios
ranged
from
393
to
420
maximum
possible
score
5)
Surgeons
used
the
word
error
or
mistake
in
only
57%
of
disclosure
conversations
took
responsibility
for
the
error
in
65%
of
encounters
and
offered
a
verbal
apology
in
47%
Surgeons
acknowledged
or
validated
patients'
emotions
in
55%
of
scenarios
Eight
percent
discussed
how
similar
errors
would
be
prevented
and
20%
offered
a
second
opinion
or
transfer
of
care
to
another
surgeon
The
patient
safety
movement
calls
for
disclosure
of
medical
errors
but
significant
gaps
exist
between
how
surgeons
disclose
errors
and
patient
preferences
Programs
should
be
developed
to
teach
surgeons
how
to
communicate
more
effectively
with
patients
about
errors
