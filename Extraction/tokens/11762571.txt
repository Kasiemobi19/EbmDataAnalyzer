How
efficacious
and
safe
is
short-acting
methylphenidate
for
the
treatment
of
attention-deficit
disorder
in
children
and
adolescents
A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Numerous
small
clinical
trials
have
been
carried
out
to
study
the
behaviourally
defined
efficacy
and
safety
of
short-acting
methylphenidate
compared
with
placebo
for
attention-deficit
disorder
(ADD)
in
individuals
aged
18
years
and
less
However
no
meta-analyses
that
carefully
examined
these
questions
have
been
done
We
reviewed
the
behavioural
evidence
from
all
the
randomized
controlled
trials
that
compared
methylphenidate
and
placebo
and
completed
a
meta-analysis
We
searched
several
electronic
sources
for
articles
published
between
1981
and
1999

The

Registry
and
Current
Controlled
Trials
were
also
consulted
A
study
was
considered
eligible
for
inclusion
if
it
entailed
the
following
a
placebo-controlled
randomized
trial
that
involved
short-acting
methylphenidate
and
participants
aged
18
years
or
less
at
the
start
of
the
trial
who
had
received
any
primary
diagnosis
of
ADD
that
was
made
in
a
systematic
and
reproducible
way
We
included
62
randomized
trials
that
involved
a
total
of
2897
participants
with
a
primary
diagnosis
of
ADD
(eg
with
or
without
hyperactivity)
The
median
age
of
trial
participants
was
87
years
and
the
median
"percent
male"
composition
of
trials
was
881%
Most
studies
used
a
crossover
design
Using
the
scores
from
2
separate
indices
this
collection
of
trials
exhibited
low
quality
Interventions
lasted
on
average
3
weeks
with
no
trial
lasting
longer
than
28
weeks
Each
primary
outcome
(hyperactivity
index)
demonstrated
a
significant
effect
of
methylphenidate
(effect

However
these
apparent
beneficial
effects
are
tempered
by
a
strong
indication
of
publication
bias
and
the
lack
of
robustness
of
the
findings
especially
those
involving
core
ADD
features
Methylphenidate
also
has
an
adverse
event
profile
that
requires
consideration
For
example
clinicians
only
need
to
treat
4
children
to
identify
an
episode
of
decreased
appetite
Short-acting
methylphenidate
has
a
statistically
significant
clinical
effect
in
the
short-term
treatment
of
individuals
with
a
diagnosis
of
ADD
aged
18
years
and
less
However
the
extension
of
this
placebo-controlled
effect
beyond
4
weeks
of
treatment
has
not
been
demonstrated
Exact
knowledge
of
the
extent
and
definition
of
the
short-term
behavioural
usefulness
of
methylphenidate
is
questioned
