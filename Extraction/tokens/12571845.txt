Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
long-term
intraarticular
(IA)
steroid
injections
for
knee
pain
related
to
osteoarthritis
(OA)
In
a
randomized
double-blind
trial
68
patients
with
OA
of
the
knee
received
IA
injections
of
triamcinolone
acetonide
40
mg
(34
patients)
or
saline
(34
patients)
into
the
study
knee
every
3
months
for
up
to
2
years
The
primary
outcome
variable
was
radiologic
progression
of
joint
space
narrowing
of
the
injected
knee
after
2
years
Measurements
of
minimum
joint
space
width
were
performed
by
an
automated
computerized
method
on
standardized
fluoroscopically
guided
radiographs
taken
with
the
patient
standing
and
with
the
knee
in
a
semiflexed
position
The
clinical
efficacy
measure
of
primary
interest
was
the
pain
subscale
from
the
Western
Ontario
and
McMaster
Universities
OA
Index
(WOMAC)
Efficacy
measures
of
secondary
interest
were
the
total
score
on
the
WOMAC
physician's
global
assessment
patient's
global
assessment
patient's
assessment
of
pain
range
of
motion
(ROM)
of
the
affected
knee
and
50-foot
walking
time
Clinical
symptoms
were
assessed
just
before
each
injection
At
the
1-year
and
2-year
followup
evaluations
no
difference
was
noted
between
the
two
treatment
groups
with
respect
to
loss
of
joint
space
over
time
The
steroid-injected
knees
showed
a
trend
toward
greater
symptom
improvement
especially
at
1
year
for
the
WOMAC
pain
subscale
night
pain
and
ROM
values
(P
=
005)
compared
with
the
saline-injected
knees
Using
area
under
the
curve
analyses
knee
pain
and
stiffness
were
significantly
improved
throughout
the
2-year
study
by
repeated
injections
of
triamcinolone
acetonide
but
not
saline
(P
<
005)
Our
findings
support
the
long-term
safety
of
IA
steroid
injections
for
patients
with
symptomatic
knee
OA
No
deleterious
effects
of
the
long-term
administration
of
IA
steroids
on
the
anatomical
structure
of
the
knee
were
noted
Moreover
long-term
treatment
of
knee
OA
with
repeated
steroid
injections
appears
to
be
clinically
effective
for
the
relief
of
symptoms
of
the
disease
