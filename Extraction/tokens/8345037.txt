Cardiac
effects
of
long
term
thyrotropin-suppressive
therapy
with
levothyroxine
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
effects
of
long
term
thyroid
hormone
suppressive
therapy
on
the
heart
20
patients
were
evaluated
by
noninvasive
techniques
Of
them
10
were
athyreotic
after
surgery
for
differentiated
thyroid
cancer
and
10
had
diffuse
or
nodular
goiter
The
mean
age
of
the
group
was
39
+/-
11
yr
Twenty
age-
and
sex-matched
subjects
served
as
controls
The
mean
dose
of
levothyroxine
was
163
+/-
34
micrograms
daily
Plasma
TSH
was
undetectable
in
all
patients
Mean
serum
T4
free
T4
and
sex
hormone-binding
globulin
were
significantly
higher
(P
<
0001)
whereas
mean
serum
T3
free
T3
and
osteocalcin
did
not
differ
from
control
levels
Cardiac
evaluation
consisted
of
a
standard
12-lead
electrocardiogram
an
ambulatory
electrocardiographic
monitoring
(Holter)
and
an
echocardiographic
study
Two
patients
showed
abnormal
electrocardiograms
for
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
Holter
demonstrated
an
increase
in
average
heart
rate
(84
+/-
7
vs
70
+/-
6
beats/min
P
<
001)
Prevalence
of
atrial
premature
beats
was
higher
in
the
patient
group
than
in
the
control
group
(100%
vs
60%
P
<
0006)
The
echocardiogram
showed
an
increased
left
ventricular
mass
index
in
the
patient
group
(97
+/-
24
vs
80
+/-
18
g/m2
P
<
002)
Furthermore
left
ventricular
systolic
function
was
enhanced
with
higher
values
of
fractional
shortening
(38
+/-
7%
vs
34
+/-
4%
P
<
005)
and
rate-adjusted
velocity
of
shortening
(12
+/-
013
vs
105
+/-
014
circumferences/sec
P
<
001)
These
findings
indicate
that
long
term
levothyroxine
therapy
at
suppressive
doses
markedly
affects
cardiac
function
