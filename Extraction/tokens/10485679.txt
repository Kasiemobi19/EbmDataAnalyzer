Adenoidectomy
and
adenotonsillectomy
for
recurrent
acute
otitis
media
parallel
randomized
clinical
trials
in
children
not
previously
treated
with
tympanostomy
tubes
Abstract
Text
Adenoidectomy
and
adenotonsillectomy
are
commonly
performed
in
US
children
to
reduce
the
occurrence
of
persistent
or
recurrent
otitis
media
but
evidence
supporting
the
efficacy
of
the
operations
is
limited
To
test
the
efficacy
of
adenoidectomy
and
adenotonsillectomy
in
children
with
persistent
or
recurrent
otitis
media
who
had
not
previously
undergone
tube
placement
and
to
compare
the
relative
efficacy
of
adenoidectomy
alone
vs
adenotonsillectomy
in
such
children
Two
parallel
randomized
clinical
trials
A
total
of
461
children
aged
3
to
15
years
were
enrolled
at
Children's
Hospital
of
Pittsburgh
Pa
between
April
1980
and
April
1994
Four
hundred
ten
children
were
observed
for
up
to
3
years
Children
without
recurrent
throat
infection
or
tonsillar
hypertrophy
(304
enrolled
266
followed
up)
were
randomized
to
either
an
adenoidectomy
adenotonsillectomy
or
control
group
children
who
had
such
conditions
(157
enrolled
144
followed
up)
were
randomized
to
an
adenotonsillectomy
or
control
group
Occurrence
rate
of
episodes
of
acute
otitis
media
by
treatment
group
and
estimated
proportion
of
time
with
otitis
media
In
both
trials
most
subjects
were
eligible
because
of
recurrent
acute
otitis
media
with
or
without
persistent
otitis
media
with
effusion
A
total
of
47
children
assigned
to
surgical
treatment
groups
had
no
surgery
The
efficacy
of
surgery
in
both
trials
was
modest
and
limited
mainly
to
the
first
follow-up
year
The
largest
differences
in
that
year
were
found
in
the
3-way
trial
between
the
adenotonsillectomy
group
and
the
control
group
mean
annual
rate
of
episodes
of
acute
otitis
media
14
vs
21
(P<001)
and
mean
estimated
percentage
of
time
with
otitis
media
186%
vs
299%
(difference
113%
95%
confidence
interval
44%-182%
P=002)
Perioperative
and
postoperative
complications
or
other
adverse
events
occurred
not
infrequently
especially
among
subjects
undergoing
adenotonsillectomy
(146%)
Our
study
showed
limited
and
short-term
efficacy
of
both
adenoidectomy
and
adenotonsillectomy
given
the
risks
morbidity
and
costs
of
these
procedures
these
data
suggest
that
neither
operation
should
ordinarily
be
considered
as
a
first
surgical
intervention
in
children
whose
only
indication
is
recurrent
acute
otitis
media
