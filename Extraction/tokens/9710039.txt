Pregnancy
outcome
following
first
trimester
exposure
to
sumatriptan
Abstract
Text
We
prospectively
compared
pregnancy
outcome
after
exposure
to
sumatriptan
with
that
of
disease-matched
controls
and
nonteratogen
controls
There
were
no
differences
in
the
rates
of
live
births
spontaneous
abortions
therapeutic
abortions
or
major
birth
defects
among
the
three
groups
This
first
prospective
report
suggests
that
the
use
of
sumatriptan
during
organogenesis
is
not
associated
with
an
apparent
increased
risk
of
major
birth
defects
