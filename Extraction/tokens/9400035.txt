Abstract
Text
Transvaginal
ultrasonography
is
a
noninvasive
procedure
that
may
be
used
to
detect
endometrial
disease
However
its
usefulness
in
screening
for
asymptomatic
disease
in
postmenopausal
women
before
or
during
treatment
with
estrogen
or
estrogen-progesterone
replacement
is
not
known
We
compared
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
transvaginal
ultrasonography
and
endometrial
biopsy
for
the
detection
of
endometrial
disease
in
448
postmenopausal
women
who
received
estrogen
alone
cyclic
or
continuous
estrogen-progesterone
or
placebo
for
three
years
Concurrent
ultrasonographic
and
biopsy
results
were
available
for
577
examinations
in
the
448
women
99
percent
of
whom
were
undergoing
routine
annual
follow-up
Endometrial
thickness
was
less
than
5
mm
in
45
percent
of
the
examinations
5
to
10
mm
in
41
percent
more
than
10
mm
in
12
percent
and
not
measured
in
2
percent
and
it
was
higher
in
the
women
receiving
estrogen
alone
than
in
the
other
groups
Biopsy
detected
11
cases
of
serious
disease
1
case
of
adenocarcinoma
2
cases
of
atypical
simple
hyperplasia
and
8
cases
of
complex
hyperplasia
Biopsy
also
detected
simple
hyperplasia
in
20
cases
At
a
threshold
value
of
5
mm
for
endometrial
thickness
transvaginal
ultrasonography
had
a
positive
predictive
value
of
9
percent
for
detecting
any
abnormality
with
90
percent
sensitivity
48
percent
specificity
and
a
negative
predictive
value
of
99
percent
With
this
threshold
a
biopsy
would
be
indicated
in
more
than
half
the
women
only
4
percent
of
whom
had
serious
disease
Transvaginal
ultrasonography
has
a
poor
positive
predictive
value
but
a
high
negative
predictive
value
for
detecting
serious
endometrial
disease
in
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
