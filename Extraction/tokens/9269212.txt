Abstract
Text
Renal
disease
in
people
with
insulin-dependent
diabetes
(IDDM)
continues
to
pose
a
major
health
threat
Inhibitors
of
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(ACE)
slow
the
decline
of
renal
function
in
advanced
renal
disease
but
their
effects
at
earlier
stages
are
unclear
and
the
degree
of
albuminuria
at
which
treatment
should
start
is
not
known
We
carried
out
a
randomised
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
of
the
ACE
inhibitor
lisinopril
in
530
men
and
women
with
IDDM
aged
20-59
years
with
normoalbuminuria
or
microalbuminuria
Patients
were
recruited
from
18
European
centres
and
were
not
on
medication
for
hypertension
Resting
blood
pressure
at
entry
was
at
least
75
and
no
more
than
90
mm
Hg
diastolic
and
no
more
than
155
mm
Hg
systolic
Urinary
albumin
excretion
rate
(AER)
was
centrally
assessed
by
means
of
two
overnight
urine
collections
at
baseline
6
12
18
and
24
months
There
were
no
difference
in
baseline
characteristics
by
treatment
group
mean
AER
was
80
micrograms/min
in
both
groups
and
prevalence
of
microalbuminuria
was
13%
and
17%
in
the
placebo
and
lisinopril
groups
respectively
On
intention-to-treat
analysis
at
2
years
AER
was
22
micrograms/min
lower
in
the
lisinopril
than
in
the
placebo
group
a
percentage
difference
of
188%
(95%
CI
20-327
p
=
003)
adjusted
for
baseline
AER
and
centre
absolute
difference
22
micrograms/min
In
people
with
normoalbuminuria
the
treatment
difference
was
10
microgram/min
(127%
[-29
to
260]
p
=
01)
In
those
with
microalbuminuria
however
the
treatment
difference
was
342
micrograms/min
(497%
[-145
to
779]
p
=
01
for
interaction
p
=
004)
For
patients
who
completed
24
months
on
the
trial
the
final
treatment
difference
in
AER
was
385
micrograms/min
in
those
with
microalbuminuria
at
baseline
(p
=
0001)
and
023
microgram/min
in
those
with
normoalbuminuria
at
baseline
(p
=
06)
There
was
no
treatment
difference
in
hypoglycaemic
events
or
in
metabolic
control
as
assessed
by
glycated
haemoglobin
Lisinopril
slows
the
progression
of
renal
disease
in
normotensive
IDDM
patients
with
little
or
no
albuminuria
though
greatest
effect
was
in
those
with
microalbuminuria
(AER
>
or
=
20
micrograms/min)
Our
results
show
that
lisinopril
does
not
increase
the
risk
of
hypoglycaemic
events
in
IDDM
