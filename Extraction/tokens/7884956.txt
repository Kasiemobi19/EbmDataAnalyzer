Title
Antibiotics
in
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
exacerbations
A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
A
meta-analysis
of
randomized
trials
was
performed
to
estimate
the
effectiveness
of
antibiotics
in
treating
exacerbations
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD)
English-language
studies
published
from
1955
through
1994
were
retrieved
using
MEDLINE
Index
Medicus
bibliographies
and
consultation
with
experts
MEDLINE
search
terms
included
"COPD"
"chronic
bronchitis"
and
"antibiotic(s)"
Only
randomized
trials
that
enrolled
patients
having
an
exacerbation
of
COPD
used
an
antibiotic
in
the
treatment
group
and
placebo
in
the
control
group
and
provided
sufficient
data
to
calculate
an
effect
size
were
included
in
the
meta-analysis
Descriptive
and
outcome
data
from
each
study
were
independently
in
the
meta-analysis
Overall
summary
effect
size
of
the
nine
trials
satisfying
all
inclusion
criteria
was
022
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
010
to
034)
indicating
a
small
benefit
in
the
antibiotic-treated
group
Similar
analysis
of
the
six
studies
that
provided
data
on
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
changes
revealed
a
summary
effect
size
of
019
(95%
CI
003
to
035)
and
a
summary
change
in
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
of
1075
L/min
(95%
CI
496
to
1654
L/min)
in
favor
of
the
antibiotic-treated
group
Sensitivity
analyses
did
not
significantly
affect
these
results
These
analyses
suggest
a
small
but
statistically
significant
improvement
due
to
antibiotic
therapy
in
patients
with
exacerbations
of
COPD
This
antibiotic-associated
improvement
may
be
clinically
significant
especially
in
patients
with
low
baseline
flow
rates
