Title
Eletriptan
for
acute
migraine
Abstract
Text
Eletriptan
(Relpax)
is
a
new
triptan
soon
to
be
made
available
by
prescription
for
the
treatment
of
acute
migraine
Currently
five
triptans
are
available
by
prescription
and
more
are
under
development
In
light
of
the
many
drugs
for
treating
acute
migraine
there
is
a
need
for
evidence-based
assessments
to
help
determine
the
relative
efficacy
and
harm
of
these
treatments
To
determine
the
efficacy
of
eletriptan
for
treating
a
single
migraine
attack
using
the
outcomes
of
headache
response
and
pain-free
response
at
05
1
2
and
4
hours
and
sustained
relief
over
24
hours
To
express
efficacy
in
terms
of
number-needed-to-treat
(NNT)
To
determine
the
adverse
effects
of
a
single
dose
of
eletriptan
and
express
this
in
terms
of
number-needed-to-harm
(NNH)
To
allow
for
the
comparison
of
the
efficacy
of
eletriptan
with
other
migraine
treatments
evaluated
systematically
in
the
same
way
Data
from
all
Phase
III
randomised
placebo-controlled
trials
were
made
available
by
the
manufacturer
Pfizer
Inc
To
date
these
trials
comprise
the
only
data
on
eletriptan
relevant
to
this
review
in
a
published
or
unpublished
form
thus
searches
of
electronic
databases
for
further
trials
of
eletriptan
were
not
conducted

Trials
were

Dichotomous

were

for

outcomes
for

20
mg
40
mg
and

The
main
outcomes
considered
were
headache
response
at
1
and
2
hours
pain-free
response
at
2
hours
sustained
relief
over
24
hours
and

Minor
outcomes
considered
were
headache
response
at
05
and
4
hours
and
pain-free
response
at
05
1
and
4
hours
Six
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Significant
benefit
of
eletriptan
over
placebo
was
shown
for
eletriptan
20
mg
40
mg
and
80
mg
for
the
primary
efficacy
outcomes
of
headache
response
and
pain-free
response
at
2
hours
For
headache
response
at
2
hours
the
NNTs
(with
95%
confidence
intervals)
were
44
(34
to
62)
29
(26
to
33)
and
26
(24
to
30)
for
eletriptan
20
mg
40
mg
and
80
mg
respectively
For
pain-free
response
at
2
hours
the
NNTs
were
99
(69
to
18)
45
(40
to
51)
and
37
(34
to
42)
for
eletriptan
20
mg
40
and
80
mg
respectively
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
incidence
of
major
adverse
effects
between
any
dose
of
eletriptan
and
placebo
The
incidence
of
minor
adverse
effects
was
significantly
higher
for
all
eletriptan
doses
than
for
placebo
with
NNHs
of
11
(95%
confidence
interval
62
to
39)
70
(52
to
11)
and
37
(31
to
45)
for
eletriptan
20
mg
40
mg
and
80
mg
respectively
Eletriptan
20
mg
40
mg
and
80
mg
are
effective
for
the
treatment
of
an
acute
migraine
attack
Effectiveness
is
dose-related
with
statistically
significant
differences
between
doses
for
pain-free
response
and
24-hour
outcomes
Eletriptan
compares
well
with
other
triptans
available
for
outcomes
measured
up
to
2
hours
and
provides
meaningful
relief
for
24
hours
Taken
as
a
single
dose
eletriptan
was
well
tolerated
and
caused
no
major
harm
The
incidence
of
minor
harm
was
dose-dependent
with
80
mg
giving
significantly
more
adverse
effects
than
40
mg
