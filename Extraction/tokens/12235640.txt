Fat

intake
and
subsequent
breast
cancer
risk
in
postmenopausal
women
Abstract
Text
The
role
of
diet
in
the
etiology
of
breast
cancer
has
been
extensively
evaluated
Case-control
studies
generally
support
an
association
while
cohort
studies
have
produced
inconsistent
results
This
study
carried
out
on
the
ORDET
cohort
is
the
first
prospective
Italian
study
to
address
the
relation
between
diet
and
breast
cancer
Female
volunteers
were
recruited
from
1987
to
1992
among
residents
of
Varese
Province
Northern
Italy
an
area
covered
by
a
cancer
registry
A
semiquantitative
self-administered
food
questionnaire
was
completed
by
participants
After
a
mean
55
yr
of
follow-up
56
cases
of
invasive
breast
cancer
were
identified
among
the
3367
postmenopausal
members
214
controls
were
randomly
chosen
from
the
cohort
matched
to
cases
for
age
menopausal
status
at
recruitment
recruitment
center
and
recruitment
period
The
adjusted
odds
ratios
for
the
highest
tertile
of
intake
vs
the
lowest
were
347
[95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
=
143-844]
for
total
fat
378
(95%
CI
=
095-150)
for
animal
protein
and
042
(95%
CI
=
018-095)
for
total
carbohydrates
These
findings
indicate
a
significant
positive
association
between
total
fat
and
animal
protein
and
risk
of
breast
cancer
and
an
inverse
association
with
carbohydrates
and
constitute
new
evidence
for
a
role
of
diet
in
the
etiology
of
breast
cancer
