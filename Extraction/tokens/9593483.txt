Review

the
evidence

use

erythromycin
in
the
management
of
persons
exposed
to
pertussis
Abstract
Text
We
assessed
the
quality
of
evidence
for
the
use
of
erythromycin
in
preventing
secondary
transmission
of
pertussis
to
close
contacts
of
primary
cases
A
literature
search
was
undertaken
and
identified
papers
were
reviewed
critically
Thirteen
original
papers
and
1
manuscript
met
the
inclusion
criteria
for
review
(3
randomized
controlled
trials
4
analytical
studies
and
7
descriptive
studies)
Evidence
from
both
experimental
and
analytical
studies
showed
little
effect
of
the
use
of
erythromycin
in
preventing
secondary
transmission
Its
effect
is
at
best
modest
when
compared
with
the
protection
conferred
by
use
of
good
quality
whole
cell
vaccine
Three
studies
reported
adverse
events
with
erythromycin
prophylaxis
these
were
mainly
nausea
vomiting
and
abdominal
pain
In
countries
where
effective
pertussis
vaccines
are
in
use
erythromycin
use
should
be
confined
to
close
contacts
of
cases
particularly
unimmunized
children
or
partially
immunized
infants
who
would
be
most
susceptible
to
the
complications
of
pertussis
or
adults
who
come
into
close
contact
with
vulnerable
children
