Title
Which
women
with
stress
incontinence
require
urodynamic
evaluation
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
the
predictive
value
of
the
symptom
of
stress
urinary
incontinence
and
to
evaluate
the
ability
of
other
factors
suggested
by
a
published
Agency
for
Health
Care
Policy
and
Research
guideline
for
the
discrimination
of
patients
unlikely
to
require
urodynamic
testing
before
surgical
management
We
evaluated
950
consecutive
women
without
advanced
(stage
III
or
IV)
pelvic
organ
prolapse
who
were
referred
with
symptoms
of
incontinence
Incontinence
was
recorded
by
means
of
standard
forms
and
was
characterized
as
"any
stress
loss"
(764%)
"primarily
stress
loss"
(589%)
"stress
loss
only"
(298%)
"stress
and
urge
loss"
(522%)
"urge
loss
only"
(138%)
"constant
and
stress
loss"
(19%)
or
"constant
loss"
(23%)
Other
variables
were
assessed
by
means
of
a
standardized
history
physical
examination
(including
urethral
axis
determination
and
stress
test)
1-week
urinary
diary
and
postvoid
residual
volume
measurement
A
urodynamic
diagnosis
of
pure
genuine
stress
incontinence
was
used
as
the
criterion
standard
Sensitivity
specificity
and
positive
and
negative
predictive
values
were
calculated
Logistic
regression
models
incorporating
various
combinations
of
stress
loss
only
previous
prolapse
or
incontinence
surgery
nocturia
voiding
frequency
urethral
hypermobility
and
postvoid
residual
volume
<100
mL
(the
factors
recommended
by
the
Agency
for
Health
Care
Policy
and
Research
guidelines)
along
with
age
and
race
as
predictors
of
genuine
stress
incontinence
were
constructed
to
evaluate
the
predictive
ability
of
the
guideline
in
a
subset
of
447
patients
for
whom
data
on
all
variables
were
available
Of
the
entire
population
480
(505%)
had
pure
genuine
stress
incontinence
134
(141%)
had
both
genuine
stress
incontinence
and
detrusor
instability
180
(189%)
had
pure
detrusor
instability
and
40
(42%)
had
intrinsic
sphincter
deficiency
Fifty-four
(57%)
had
normal
study
results
and
62
(65%)
had
other
nonincontinence
diagnoses
Among
the
subjects
with
symptoms
of
stress
loss
only
108%
did
not
have
genuine
stress
incontinence
confirmed
on
urodynamic
examination

criteria
had
excellent
discrimination
(C
statistic
of
0807)
compared
with
the
sole
criterion
of
stress
urinary
incontinence
only
(C
statistic
of
0574)
with
a
positive
predictive
value
of
857%
Only
78%
of
subjects
met
all
the
criteria
however
and
57%
of
these
ultimately
had
a
urodynamic
diagnosis
of
either
detrusor
instability
or
normal
study
result
The
predictive
value
of
stress
symptoms
alone
was
not
high
enough
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
surgical
management
Agency
for
Health
Care
Policy
and
Research
guidelines
improved
the
predictive
value
but
were
applicable
to
only
a
small
subset
of
patients
referred
with
urinary
incontinence
