Title
Beta2-agonists
for
acute
bronchitis
Abstract
Text
The
optimal
treatment
for
acute
bronchitis
is
not
clear
Because
many
patients
with
acute
bronchitis
have
airflow
limitation
as
well
as
cough
beta2-agonists
may
be
useful
To
determine
whether
beta2-agonists
improve
the
symptoms
of
acute
bronchitis
in
patients
who
do
not
have
underlying
pulmonary
disease

MEDLINE
(January

EMBASE
(January
2000
to
July

was
run
in
July
2003
Trials
in
which
patients
(adults
or
children
over
two
years
of
age)
without
known
pulmonary
disease
who
were
diagnosed
with
acute
bronchitis
or
acute
cough
without
other
cause
were
randomized
to
beta2-agonist
versus
placebo
no
treatment
or
alternative
treatment
Three
reviewers
independently
first
selected
outcomes
and
evaluated
trial
quality
while
blinded
to
study
results
and
then
extracted
data
Trials
in
children
and
in
adults
were
analyzed
separately
Two
trials
in
children
(n
=
109)
with
acute
cough
and
no
evidence
of
airway
obstruction
did
not
find
any
benefits
from
beta2-agonists
Combined
data
did
not
show
a
significant
difference
in
daily
cough
scores
between
patients
given
oral
beta2-agonists
and
those
in
the
control
groups
Five
trials
in
adults
(n
=
418)
with
acute
cough
or
acute
bronchitis
had
mixed
results
but
overall
summary
statistics
did
not
reveal
any
significant
benefits
from
oral
(three
trials)
nor
inhaled
(two
trials)
beta2-agonists
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
daily
cough
scores
nor
in
the
number
of
patients
still
coughing
after
seven
days
(control
rate
73%
RR
=
077
95%
CI
054-109)
Subgroups
of
patients
with
evidence
of
airflow
limitation
had
lower
symptom
scores
if
given
beta2-agonists
in
one
trial
and
the
trials
that
did
note
quicker
resolution
of
cough
in
patients
given
beta2-agonists
were
those
that
had
a
higher
proportion
of
patients
with
wheezing
at
baseline
Patients
given
beta2-agonists
were
more
likely
to
report
tremor
shakiness
or
nervousness
than
patients
in
the
control
groups
(for

There
is
no
evidence
to
support
using
beta2-agonists
in
children
with
acute
cough
who
do
not
have
evidence
of
airflow
obstruction
There
is
also
little
evidence
that
the
routine
use
of
beta2-agonists
for
adults
with
acute
cough
is
helpful
These
agents
may
reduce
symptoms
including
cough
in
patients
with
evidence
of
airflow
obstruction
but
this
potential
benefit
is
not
well-supported
by
the
available
data
and
must
be
weighed
against
the
adverse
effects
associated
with
beta2-agonists
