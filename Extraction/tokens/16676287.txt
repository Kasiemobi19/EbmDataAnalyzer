Do
subjective
memory
complaints
predict
cognitive
dysfunction
over
time
A
six-year
follow-up
of
the
Maastricht
Aging
Study
Abstract
Text
Middle-aged
and
older
people
often
worry
that
their
perceived
diminishing
memory
function
may
indicate
incipient
dementia
The
present
study
addresses
questions
regarding
subjective
memory
complaints
as
a
predictor
of
lower
performance
on
cognitive
tasks
Also
in
participants
with
subjective
memory
complaints
it
was
investigated
whether
trying
to
keep
mentally
active
improved
memory
function
Characteristics
of
the
participants
who
were
and
were
not
interested
in
an
intervention
to
decrease
worries
and
to
improve
memory
in
daily
life
were
determined
Data
were
obtained
from
a
large
longitudinal
study
the
Maastricht
Aging
Study
involving
557
participants
aged
55
to
85
years
Follow-up
measurement
was
performed
after
6
years
Outcome
variables
were
simple
complex
and
general
information
processing
speed
and
immediate
and
delayed
recall
At
baseline
forgetfulness
was
associated
with
a
slower
general
information
processing
and
delayed
recall
At
the
six-year
follow-up
being
forgetful
was
not
associated
with
a
significant
change
in
cognitive
performance
Taking
steps
to
remain
cognitively
active
was
not
a
predictor
of
better
performance
on
cognitive
tasks
at
baseline
or
at
the
six-year
follow-up
Being
forgetful
might
be
an
indicator
of
slower
general
information
processing
speed
and
delayed
recall
at
baseline
but
does
not
predict
cognitive
change
over
6
years
in
older
adults
However
the
effects
are
rather
small
and
cannot
directly
be
generalized
to
applications
in
clinical
settings
Other
factors
such
as
depression
and
anxiety
might
also
underlie
the
cause
of
the
forgetfulness
