A
double-blinded
randomized

trial

oxytocin
at

versus
the
end
of
the
third
stage
of

for

Abstract
Text
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
administration
of
oxytocin
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
third
stage
of
labor
for
the
prevention
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
Patients
with
documented
singleton
pregnancies
were
randomly
assigned
to
two
groups
The
first
received
10
units
of
oxytocin
intramuscularly
at
delivery
of
the
anterior
shoulder
of
the
fetus
and
an
identical
appearing
placebo
injection
following
delivery
of
the
placenta
The
second
received
the
opposite
medication
sequence
The
study
was
double
blinded
Blood
loss
was
measured
by
weighing
all
fluids
collected
visual
estimation
and
serial
blood
counts
27
women
received
oxytocin
at
the
delivery
of
the
fetal
shoulder
and
24
after
the
placenta
Oxytocin
given
after
placenta
delivery
resulted
in
lower
blood
loss
(345
vs
400
ml
p
=
028)
lower
collection
bag
weight
(763
vs
833
g
p
=
055)
lower
change
in
HgB
(-126
vs
-132
g
p
=
086)
lower
DeltaHCT
(-343
vs
-364%
p
=
085)
and
a
shorter
third
stage
of
labor
duration
(86
vs
92
min
p
=
075)
The
incidence
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
defined
as
estimated
blood
loss
>500
ml
(0
vs
148%)
was
significantly
lowered
with
oxytocin
following
placental
delivery
(p
=
0049)
In
our
study
postpartum
hemorrhage
was
less
frequent
when
oxytocin
administration
was
delayed
until
after
placenta
delivery
