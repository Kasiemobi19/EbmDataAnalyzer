Title
A
randomized
trial
of
the
angiotensin-receptor
blocker
valsartan
in
chronic
heart
failure
Abstract
Text
Actions
of
angiotensin
II
may
contribute
to
the
progression
of
heart
failure
despite
treatment
with
currently
recommended
drugs
We
therefore
evaluated
the
long-term
effects
of
the
addition
of
the
angiotensin-receptor
blocker
valsartan
to
standard
therapy
for
heart
failure
A
total
of
5010
patients
with
heart
failure
of
New
York
Heart
Association
(NYHA)
class
II
III
or
IV
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
160
mg
of
valsartan
or
placebo
twice
daily
The
primary
outcomes
were
mortality
and
the
combined
end
point
of
mortality
and
morbidity
defined
as
the
incidence
of
cardiac
arrest
with
resuscitation
hospitalization
for
heart
failure
or
receipt
of
intravenous
inotropic
or
vasodilator
therapy
for
at
least
four
hours
Overall
mortality
was
similar
in
the
two
groups
The
incidence
of
the
combined
end
point
however
was
132
percent
lower
with
valsartan
than
with
placebo
(relative
risk
087
975
percent
confidence
interval
077
to
097
P=0009)
predominantly
because
of
a
lower
number
of
patients
hospitalized
for
heart
failure
455
(182
percent)
in
the
placebo
group
and
346
(138
percent)
in
the
valsartan
group
(P<0001)
Treatment
with
valsartan
also
resulted
in
significant
improvements
in
NYHA
class
ejection
fraction
signs
and
symptoms
of
heart
failure
and
quality
of
life
as
compared
with
placebo
(P<001)
In
a
post
hoc
analysis
of
the
combined
end
point
and
mortality
in
subgroups
defined
according
to
base-line
treatment
with
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
or
beta-blockers
valsartan
had
a
favorable
effect
in
patients
receiving
neither
or
one
of
these
types
of
drugs
but
an
adverse
effect
in
patients
receiving
both
types
of
drugs
Valsartan
significantly
reduces
the
combined
end
point
of
mortality
and
morbidity
and
improves
clinical
signs
and
symptoms
in
patients
with
heart
failure
when
added
to
prescribed
therapy
However
the
post
hoc
observation
of
an
adverse
effect
on
mortality
and
morbidity
in
the
subgroup
receiving
valsartan
an
ACE
inhibitor
and
a
beta-blocker
raises
concern
about
the
potential
safety
of
this
specific
combination
