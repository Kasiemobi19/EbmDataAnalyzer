Adverse
effects
of
iron
supplementation
a
comparative
trial
of
a
wax-matrix
iron
preparation
and
conventional
ferrous
sulfate
tablets
Abstract
Text
The
acceptability
of
supplemental
iron
delivered
from
a
wax-matrix
tablet
of
ferrous
sulfate
was
compared
with
that
of
a
conventional
ferrous
sulfate
tablet
in
a
single-blind
parallel-group
study
Both
tablets
were
formulated
to
deliver
50
mg
of
elemental
iron
The
incidence
of
adverse
effects
was
found
to
be
significantly
greater
among
272
subjects
taking
the
conventional
tablets
than
among
271
subjects
taking
the
wax-matrix
preparation
Eighty-one
percent
of
the
subjects
taking
the
wax-matrix
preparation
experienced
no
severe
or
moderate
side
effects
as
compared
with
only
50%
of
those
taking
the
conventional
tablets
