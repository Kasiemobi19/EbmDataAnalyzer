Abstract
Text
To
test
the
hypothesis
that
prophylactic
administration
of
clindamycin
2%
vaginal
cream
can
reduce
the
incidence
of
preterm
birth
in
a
high
risk
population
A
multi-centre
randomised
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Twelve
city
hospitals
in
The
Netherlands
One
hundred
and
sixty-eight
women
with
a
singleton
pregnancy
and
a
history
of
a
spontaneous
preterm
delivery
in
the
preceding
pregnancy
Clindamycin
2%
vaginal
cream
or
placebo
cream
administered
daily
for
seven
days
at
26
and
32
weeks
of
gestation
Spontaneous
preterm
birth
at
<
37
weeks
admission
for
threatened
preterm
labour
neonatal
infectious
morbidity
In
the
intention-to-treat
analysis
no
difference
was
found
in
overall
preterm
birth
between
clindamycin
and
placebo
(23%
vs
18%
respectively)
In
the
subgroup
who
completed
the
trial
and
administered
all
medication
more
women
delivered
before
34
weeks
in
the
clindamycin
group
(14%
in
the
placebo
vs
90%
in
the
clindamycin
group
P
<
005)
The
length
of
admissions
for
threatened
preterm
labour
did
not
differ
More
infectious
neonatal
morbidity
was
seen
in
the
clindamycin
group
(5/83
vs
0/85
P
<
005)
Clindamycin
2%
vaginal
cream
given
prophylactically
to
women
with
a
spontaneous
preterm
birth
in
the
preceding
pregnancy
did
not
prevent
preterm
delivery
or
reduce
the
number
of
admissions
for
threatened
preterm
labour
The
neonatal
infectious
morbidity
in
the
group
treated
with
clindamycin
was
significantly
higher
and
a
major
concern
This
multi-center
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
aimed
to
determine
whether
prophylactic
administration
of
clindamycin
2%
vaginal
cream
can
reduce
the
incidence
of
preterm
birth
in
a
high
risk
population
A
total
of
168
eligible
women
attending
the
antenatal
clinics
of
12
hospitals
in
Netherlands
participated
in
the
study
Clindamycin
2%
vaginal
cream
was
administered
to
83
women
and
placebo
cream
to
85
women
daily
for
7
days
at
26
and
32
weeks
of
gestation
Results
of
the
study
showed
no
difference
in
the
overall
preterm
birth
between
clindamycin
(23%)
and
placebo
(18%)
in
the
intention-to-treat
analysis
In
the
subgroup
which
completed
the
trial
and
administered
all
medication
more
women
delivered
before
34
weeks
in
the
clindamycin
group
(9%)
compared
to
the
placebo
group
(14%)
Moreover
occurrence
of
neonatal
infectious
morbidity
was
higher
in
the
clindamycin
group
(5/83
vs
0/85
P
005)
In
conclusion
clindamycin
2%
vaginal
cream
given
prophylactically
to
women
with
a
spontaneous
preterm
birth
in
the
preceding
pregnancy
did
not
prevent
preterm
delivery
or
reduce
the
number
of
admissions
for
threatened
preterm
labor
