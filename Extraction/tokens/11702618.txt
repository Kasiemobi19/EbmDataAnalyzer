Title
Treatment
of
urticaria
An
evidence-based
evaluation
of
antihistamines
Abstract
Text
Urticaria
is
a
cutaneous
syndrome
characterized
by
dermal
edema
(wheal)
and
erythema
(flare)
that
blanches
with
pressure
The
lesions
typically
last
less
than
24
hours
and
are
usually
pruritic
In
1983
Christensen
and
Maibach
summarized
the
theory
behind
the
use
of
histamine
H1
receptor
antagonists
(antihistamines)
in
clinical
dermatology
These
agents
remain
the
mainstay
of
treatment
for
urticaria
This
article
reviews
the
medical
literature
on
the
effectiveness
of
antihistamines
in
urticarial
syndromes
including
acute
chronic
idiopathic
and
the
physical
urticarias
Older
antihistamines
such
as
chlorpheniramine
and
hydroxyzine
are
effective
in
the
treatment
of
urticarias
but
they
also
have
marked
sedative
and
anticholinergic
effects
Newer
nonsedating
antihistamines
(second-generation
antihistamines)
have
been
developed
that
have
reduced
adverse
effects
because
they
do
not
cross
the
blood-brain
barrier
these
agents
(acrivastine
cetirizine
loratadine
mizolastine
fexofenadine
ebastine
azelastine
and
epinastine)
cause
significantly
less
sedation
and
psychomotor
impairment
than
their
older
counterparts
A
review
of
the
literature
reveals
that
there
are
few
studies
which
document
the
efficacy
of
second-generation
antihistamines
in
the
treatment
of
acute
urticaria
a
biologic
entity
that
usually
resolves
within
3
weeks
We
did
not
identify
controlled
studies
that
suggested
superiority
of
any
antihistamine
in
the
treatment
of
acute
urticaria
Loratadine
or
cetirizine
and
possibly
mizolastine
appear
to
be
treatments
of
choice
for
chronic
idiopathic
urticaria
For
symptomatic
dermatographism
the
combination
of
an
antihistamine
and
an
H2
antagonist
eg
chlorpheniramine
and
cimetidine
appears
to
be
effective
Very
few
studies
have
been
conducted
on
the
use
of
antihistamines
in
the
treatment
of
cold
cholinergic
and
pressure
urticaria
Antihistamines
are
the
mainstay
of
urticarial
therapy
This
evidence-based
review
suggests
that
there
are
efficacy
differences
between
newer
nonsedating
antihistamines
and
older
agents
in
some
forms
of
the
disorder
Clearly
further
well-controlled
clinical
trials
in
larger
numbers
of
patients
are
needed
to
clarify
the
role
of
these
agents
in
the
treatment
of
urticaria
