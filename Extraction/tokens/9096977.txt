The
Da
Qing
IGT
and
Diabetes
Study
Abstract
Text
Individuals
with
impaired
glucose
tolerance
(IGT)
have
a
high
risk
of
developing
NIDDM
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
diet
and
exercise
interventions
in
those
with
IGT
may
delay
the
development
of
NIDDM
ie
reduce
the
incidence
of
NIDDM
and
thereby
reduce
the
overall
incidence
of
diabetic
complications
such
as
cardiovascular
renal
and
retinal
disease
and
the
excess
mortality
attributable
to
these
complications
In
1986
110660
men
and
women
from
33
health
care
clinics
in
the
city
of
Da
Qing
China
were
screened
for
IGT
and
NIDDM
Of
these
individuals
577
were
classified
(using
World
Health
Organization
criteria)
as
having
IGT
Subjects
were
randomized
by
clinic
into
a
clinical
trial
either
to
a
control
group
or
to
one
of
three
active
treatment
groups
diet
only
exercise
only
or
diet
plus
exercise
Follow-up
evaluation
examinations
were
conducted
at
2-year
intervals
over
a
6-year
period
to
identify
subjects
who
developed
NIDDM
Cox's
proportional
hazard
analysis
was
used
to
determine
if
the
incidence
of
NIDDM
varied
by
treatment
assignment
The
cumulative
incidence
of
diabetes
at
6
years
was
677%
(95%
CI
598-752)
in
the
control
group
compared
with
438%
(95%
CI
355-523)
in
the
diet
group
411%
(95%
CI
334-494)
in
the
exercise
group
and
460%
(95%
CI
373-547)
in
the
diet-plus-exercise
group
(P
<
005)
When
analyzed
by
clinic
each
of
the
active
intervention
groups
differed
significantly
from
the
control
clinics
(P
<
005)
The
relative
decrease
in
rate
of
development
of
diabetes
in
the
active
treatment
groups
was
similar
when
subjects
were
stratified
as
lean
or
overweight
(BMI
<
or
>
or
=
25
kg/m2)
In
a
proportional
hazards
analysis
adjusted
for
differences
in
baseline
BMI
and
fasting
glucose
the
diet
exercise
and
diet-plus-exercise
interventions
were
associated
with
31%
(P
<
003)
46%
(P
<
00005)
and
42%
(P
<
0005)
reductions
in
risk
of
developing
diabetes
respectively
Diet
and/or
exercise
interventions
led
to
a
significant
decrease
in
the
incidence
of
diabetes
over
a
6-year
period
among
those
with
IGT
