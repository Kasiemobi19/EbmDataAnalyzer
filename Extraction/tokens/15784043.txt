systematic

Abstract
Text
Constipation
is
common
and
its
treatment
is
unsatisfactory
Although
many
agents
have
been
tried
there
are
limited
data
to
support
their
use
Our
aim
was
to
undertake
a
systematic
review
of
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
traditional
medical
therapies
for
chronic
constipation
and
to
make
evidence-based
recommendations
We
searched
the
English
literature
for
drug
trials
evaluating
treatment
of
constipation
by
using
MEDLINE
and
PUBMED
databases
from
1966
to
2003
Only
studies
that
were
randomized
conducted
on
adult
subjects
and
published
as
full
manuscripts
were
included
Studies
were
assigned
a
quality
score
based
on
published
methodology
Standard
forms
were
used
to
abstract
data
regarding
study
design
duration
outcome
measures
and
adverse
events
By
using
the
cumulative
evidence
of
published
data
for
each
agent
recommendations
were
made
regarding
their
use
following
the
United
States
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
guidelines
Good
evidence
(Grade
A)
was
found
to
support
the
use
of
polyethylene
glycol
(PEG)
and
tegaserod
Moderate
evidence
(Grade
B)
was
found
to
support
the
use
of
psyllium
and
lactulose
There
was
a
paucity
of
quality
data
regarding
many
commonly
used
agents
including
milk
of
magnesia
senna
bisacodyl
and
stool
softeners
There
is
good
evidence
to
support
the
use
of
PEG
tegaserod
lactulose
and
psyllium
Surprisingly
there
is
a
paucity
of
trials
for
many
commonly
used
agents
These
aspects
should
be
considered
when
designing
trials
comparing
new
agents
with
traditional
therapies
because
their
use
may
not
be
well
validated
