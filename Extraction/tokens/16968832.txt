Abstract
Text
Adverse
effects
of
selective
cyclooxygenase
2
(COX-2)
inhibitors
on
renal
events
and
arrhythmia
have
been
controversial
with
suggestions
of
a
class
effect
To
quantitatively
evaluate
adverse
risks
of
renal
events
(renal
dysfunction
hypertension
and
peripheral
edema)
and
arrhythmia
events
and
to
explore
drug
class
effects
and
temporal
trends
of
apparent
effects
of
the
COX-2
inhibitors
rofecoxib
celecoxib
valdecoxib
parecoxib
etoricoxib
and
lumiracoxib
A

From
relevant
reports
114
randomized
double-blind
clinical
trials
were
included
Information
on

dose
and

were
extracted
using
a
standardized

Results
were
pooled
via
random-effects
models
and
meta-regressions
Of
116
094
participants
from
114
trial
reports
including
127
trial
populations
(40
rofecoxib

celecoxib

valdecoxib
+
parecoxib

etoricoxib
and

lumiracoxib)
there
were
a
total
of
6394
composite
renal
events
(2670
peripheral
edema
3489
hypertension
235
renal
dysfunction)
and
286
arrhythmia
events
Results
indicated
significant
heterogeneity
of
renal
effects
across
agents
(P
for
interaction
=
02)
indicating
no
class
effect
Compared
with
controls
rofecoxib
was
associated
with
increased
risk
of
arrhythmia
(relative
risk
[RR]
290
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
107-788)
and
composite
renal
events
(RR
153
95%
CI
133-176)
adverse
renal
effects
increased
with
greater
dose
and
duration
(both
P<
or
=05)
For
all
individual
renal
end
points
rofecoxib
was
associated
with
increased
risk
of
peripheral
edema
(RR
143
95%
CI
123-166)
hypertension
(RR
155
95%
CI
129-185)
and
renal
dysfunction
(RR
231
95%
CI
105-507)
In
contrast
celecoxib
was
associated
with
lower
risk
of
both
renal
dysfunction
(RR
061
95%
CI
040-094)
and
hypertension
(RR
083
95%
CI
071-097)
compared
with
controls
Other
agents
were
not
significantly
associated
with
risk
Time-cumulative
analyses
indicated
that
for
rofecoxib
the
adverse
risks
for
peripheral
edema
and
hypertension
were
evident
by
the
end
of
year
2000
and
for
risk
of
arrhythmia
by
2004
In
this
comprehensive
analysis
of
114
randomized
trials
with
116094
participants
rofecoxib
was
associated
with
increased
renal
and
arrhythmia
risks
A
COX-2
inhibitor
class
effect
was
not
evident
Future
safety
monitoring
is
warranted
and
may
benefit
from
an
active
and
continuous
cumulative
surveillance
system
