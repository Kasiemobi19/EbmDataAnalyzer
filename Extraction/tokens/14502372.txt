Title
Use
of
erythromycin
for
the
treatment
of
severe
chronic
constipation
in
children
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
of
erythromycin
was
assessed
in
the
treatment
of
14
children
aged
4
to
13
years
with
refractory
chronic
constipation
and
presenting
megarectum
and
fecal
impaction
A
double-blind
placebo-
controlled
crossover
study
was
conducted
at
the
Pediatric
Gastroenterology
Outpatient
Clinic
of
the
University
Hospital
The
patients
were
randomized
to
receive
placebo
for
4
weeks
followed
by
erythromycin
estolate
20
mg
kg-1
day-1
divided
into
four
oral
doses
for
another
4
weeks
or
vice
versa
Patient
outcome
was
assessed
according
to
a
clinical
score
from
12
(most
severe
clinical
condition)
to
0
(complete
recovery)
At
enrollment
in
the
study
and
on
the
occasion
of
follow-up
medical
visits
at
two-week
intervals
patient
score
and
laxative
requirements
were
recorded
During
the
first
30
days
the
mean
SD
clinical
score
for
the
erythromycin
group
(N
=
6)
decreased
from
82+/-23
to
22+/-10
while
the
score
for
the
placebo
group
(N
=
8)
decreased
from
78+/-21
to
29+/-28
During
the
second
crossover
phase
the
score
for
patients
on
erythromycin
ranged
from
29+/-28
to
24+/-21
and
the
score
for
the
patients
on
placebo
worsened
from
22+/-10
to
43+/-23
There
was
a
significant
improvement
in
score
when
patients
were
on
erythromycin
(P
<
001)
Mean
laxative
requirement
was
lower
when
patients
ingested
erythromycin
(P
<
005)
No
erythromycin-related
side
effects
occurred
Erythromycin
was
useful
in
this
group
of
severely
constipated
children
A
larger
trial
is
needed
to
fully
ascertain
the
prokinetic
efficacy
of
this
drug
as
an
adjunct
in
the
treatment
of
severe
constipation
in
children
