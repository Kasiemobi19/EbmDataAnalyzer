Title
Effectiveness
of
fixed
minidose
warfarin
in
the
prevention
of
thromboembolism
and
vascular
death
in
nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
Abstract
Text
Adjusted-dose
warfarin
is
effective
for
stroke
prevention
in
patients
with
nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
(AF)
but
the
risk
of
bleeding
is
high
especially
among
the
elderly
Fixed
minidose
warfarin
is
effective
in
preventing
venous
thromboembolism
with
low
risk
of
bleeding
and
no
need
for
frequent
clinical
monitoring
Patients
>
60
years
with
nonrheumatic
AF
were
randomized
in
an
open-labeled
trial
to
receive
fixed
minidose
warfarin
(125
mg/day)
or
standard
adjusted-dose
warfarin
(International
Normalized
Ratio
[INR]
between
20
and
30)
Primary
outcome
events
were
ischemic
stroke
peripheral
or
visceral
embolism
cerebral
or
fatal
bleeding
and
vascular
death
Secondary
end
points
were
major
bleeding
myocardial
infarction
and
death
This
study
was
discontinued
before
completion
in
light
of
publication
of
the
Stroke
Prevention
in
Atrial
Fibrillation
III
trial
which
indicated
that
low-intensity
fixed-dose
warfarin
treatment
(ie
INR
<
15)
was
insufficient
for
stroke
prevention
in
high-risk
patients
with
nonrheumatic
AF
From
a
total
of
1209
considered
patients
303
were
randomized
to
be
studied
(150
in
the
minidose
group
and
153
in
the
adjusted-dose
group)
Mean
follow-up
was
145
months
The
rate
of
cumulative
primary
events
was
111%
(95%
confidence
intervals
[CI]
40
to
182)
in
the
fixed
minidose
group
and
61%
(95%
CI
11
to
111)
in
the
adjusted-dose
group
(p
=
029)
The
rate
of
ischemic
stroke
was
significantly
higher
in
the
minidose
group
(37%
vs
0%
per
year
p
=
0025)
Major
bleedings
were
more
frequent
in
standard
treatment
group
(26%
vs
1%
per
year
p
=
019)
Most
thromboembolic
complications
occurred
at
INRs
<
12
whereas
the
majority
of
hemorrhages
occurred
at
INRs
>
30
No
significant
difference
in
primary
outcome
events
was
observed
in
the
abbreviated
study
However
the
significantly
increased
occurrence
of
ischemic
stroke
in
the
fixed
minidose
warfarin
group
suggests
that
this
regimen
does
not
protect
patients
with
nonrheumatic
AF
