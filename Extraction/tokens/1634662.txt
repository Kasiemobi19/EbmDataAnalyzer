Abstract
Text
The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
ascertain
how
continued
cigarette
smoking
or
smoking
cessation
related
to
long-term
survival
and
morbidity
in
patients
with
established
coronary
artery
disease
managed
with
medical
therapy
or
coronary
bypass
surgery
Although
the
association
of
cigarette
smoking
with
coronary
artery
disease
is
well
established
the
morbidity
and
mortality
associated
with
smoking
behavior
in
patients
with
such
disease
receiving
medical
or
surgical
therapy
are
less
well
established
The
780
patients
randomized
to
medical
therapy
or
coronary
bypass
surgery
in
the
Coronary
Artery
Surgery
Study
(CASS)
were
subgrouped
according
to
smoking
behavior
during
a
mean
112-year
follow-up
interval
Comparisons
between
smokers
and
nonsmokers
were
accomplished
by
univariate
and
Cox
time-dependent
multivariate
analyses
Survival
at
10
years
after
entry
into
the
study
was
82%
among
468
patients
who
reported
no
smoking
during
follow-up
(nonsmokers)
compared
with
77%
among
the
312
smokers
(p
=
0025)
Survival
was
80%
among
those
who
smoked
at
entry
but
stopped
(quitters)
versus
69%
among
those
who
continued
smoking
(p
=
0025)
For
patients
who
smoked
at
baseline
and
were
randomized
to
bypass
surgery
survival
at
10
years
was
84%
among
quitters
and
68%
among
nonquitters
(p
=
0018)
the
difference
in
survival
between
quitters
(75%)
and
nonquitters
(71%)
was
less
among
those
randomized
to
medical
therapy
(p
=
NS)
Among
those
who
smoked
at
baseline
continued
smoking
increased
the
relative
risk
of
death
by
173
After
10
years
smokers
in
comparison
with
nonsmokers
were
less
likely
to
be
angina
free
and
more
likely
to
be
unemployed
and
had
more
activity
limitation
and
more
hospital
admissions
(primarily
for
chest
pain
heart
attack
cardiac
catheterization
peripheral
vascular
surgery
and
stroke)
Thus
among
patients
with
documented
coronary
artery
disease
continued
cigarette
smoking
may
result
in
decreased
survival--especially
among
those
undergoing
bypass
surgery
Moreover
smokers
have
more
angina
more
unemployment
a
greater
limitation
of
physical
activity
and
more
hospital
admissions
