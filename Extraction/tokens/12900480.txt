DEET-based
insect
repellents
safety
implications
for
children

Abstract
Text
Reducing
the
risk
of
mosquito
bites
is
currently
the
only
way
to
reduce
the
risk
of
West
Nile
virus
infection
Methods
for
avoiding
mosquito
bites
include
limiting
the
time
spent
outdoors
at
dawn
and
dusk
wearing
protective
clothing
and
using
an
insect
repellent
Repellents
containing
DEET
(NN-diethyl-m-toluamide
also
known
as
NN-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide)
are
the
most
effective
and
most
widely
used
However
concerns
have
been
raised
over
the
risk
of
adverse
toxic
effects
especially
in
young
children
and
pregnant
and
lactating
women
In
this
article
we
review
the
available
evidence
on
the
effectiveness
and
safety
of
DEET-based
products
The
evidence
does
not
support
increased
risk
in
young
children
