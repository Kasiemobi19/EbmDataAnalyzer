Ovarian
volume
and
antral
follicle
counts
as
indicators
of
menopausal
status
Abstract
Text
Recent
studies
suggest
that
ovarian
volume
and
antral
follicle
numbers
may
be
sensitive
specific
and
early
indicators
of
menopausal
status
The
accuracy
of
these
markers
however
has
not
been
compared
directly
to
more
traditional
markers
[age
and
follicle-stimulating
hormone
(FSH)
levels]
Thus
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
test
whether
ovarian
volume
and
antral
follicle
counts
are
more
sensitive
and
specific
markers
of
menopausal
status
than
age
or
FSH
levels
Premenopausal
(n
=
34)
and
postmenopausal
(n
=
25)
women
between
40
and
54
years
old
received
a
transvaginal
ultrasound
for
determination
of
ovarian
volume
and
antral
follicle
numbers
provided
blood
for
measurement
of
FSH
levels
and
completed
a
questionnaire
FSH
levels
age
ovarian
volume
and
antral
follicle
numbers
were
compared
using
t
tests
Receiver
operating
characteristic
curves
were
generated
to
evaluate
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
each
marker
Postmenopausal
women
had
significantly
higher
FSH
levels
(p
<
or
=
00001)
smaller
ovarian
volumes
(p
<
or
=
0002)
and
fewer
antral
follicles
(p
<
or
=
0002)
than
premenopausal
women
Ovarian
volume
and
antral
follicle
numbers
had
similar
sensitivity
(273-100%)
and
specificity
(34-929%)
in
indicating
postmenopausal
status
as
FSH
levels
and
age
These
data
suggest
that
ovarian
volume
and
antral
follicle
numbers
may
be
useful
indicators
of
menopausal
status
