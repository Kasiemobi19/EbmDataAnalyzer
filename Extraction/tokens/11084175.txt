Hormone
replacement
therapy
effect
of
progestin
dose
and
time
since
menopause
on
endometrial
bleeding
Abstract
Text
To
analyze
the
effects
of
two
continuous
combined
hormone
replacement
regimens
on
bleeding
profiles
in
postmenopausal
women
based
on
progestin
dose
and
time
since
the
patient's
last
spontaneous
menstrual
period
A
randomized
double-masked
multicenter
trial
was
conducted
in
1724
women
recruited
from
99
sites
Six
hundred
seventy-eight
women
received
a
continuous
regimen
of
oral
conjugated
equine
estrogens
(CEE)
0625
mg/day
combined
with
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
(MPA)
25
or
50
mg/day
for
1
year
After
1
year
no
bleeding
was
reported
by
over
89%
of
women
More
women
in
the
50
mg/day
MPA
group
than
in
the
25
mg/day
MPA
group
reported
no
bleeding
(938%
versus
895%
P<089)
Of
those
women
who
had
had
their
last
menstrual
period
3
years
ago
or
less
a
significantly
higher
percentage
in
the
50
mg/day
MPA
group
(724%)
did
not
experience
bleeding
after
three
cycles
compared
with
the
25
mg
group
(590%
P<001)
Although
the
percentage
of
patients
without
bleeding
was
also
higher
in
the
50
mg/day
MPA
group
after
six
cycles
and
1
year
the
differences
between
groups
were
not
statistically
significant
Of
the
women
who
had
their
last
menstrual
period
more
than
3
years
ago
947%
of
those
in
the
50
mg/day
MPA
group
and
907%
of
those
in
the
25
mg/day
MPA
group
reported
no
bleeding
at
1
year
A
continuous
combined
regimen
of
CEE
plus
50
mg
MPA
may
be
more
suitable
for
women
closer
to
the
onset
of
menopause
or
for
women
starting
therapy
who
are
unwilling
to
tolerate
irregular
bleeding
The
improved
bleeding
profile
with
CEE
and
50
mg/day
MPA
is
likely
to
enhance
compliance
with
hormone
replacement
therapy
