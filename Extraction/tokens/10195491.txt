Can
noncontrast
helical
computed
tomography
replace
intravenous
urography
for
evaluation
of
patients
with
acute
urinary
tract
colic
Abstract
Text
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
helical
computed
tomography
(CT)
performed
without
oral
or
intravenous
contrast
agents
is
accurate
in
the
evaluation
of
patients
with
suspected
acute
renal
colic
One
hundred
consecutive
patients
with
suspected
renal
colic
or
ureteral
colic
were
referred
by
our
institution's
emergency
department
for
unenhanced
helical
CT
scans
We
reviewed
the
original
radiographic
report
for
each
patient
and
recorded
the
size
and
location
of
ureteral
calculi
and
other
concurrent
urinary
tract
calculi
if
any
We
also
recorded
the
presence
or
absence
of
hydronephrosis
hydroureter
perinephric
edema
and
periureteral
edema
A
total
of
49
patients
had
ureteral
calculi
17
patients
had
only
renal
calculi
and
34
patients
had
no
stones
Forty-nine
patients
had
ureteral
calculi
and
40
(82%)
of
these
49
patients
had
associated
CT
signs
including
hydroureter
and
periureteral
edema
Calculi
were
present
in
the
proximal
ureter
in
11
patients
the
midureter
in
seven
patients
and
the
distal
ureter
including
ureterovesical
junction
in
31
patients
Calculi
were
seen
elsewhere
in
the
urinary
tract
and
renal
pelvis
in
44
patients
Other
diagnostic
tests
and
stone
passage
were
used
to
confirm
the
CT
diagnosis
of
ureteral
stones
The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
helical
CT
in
evaluating
ureteral
calculi
were
100%
and
94%
respectively
Sixteen
extraurinary
lesions
were
detected
in
34
patients
who
had
no
urinary
calculi
Most
extraurinary
lesions
(81%)
were
deemed
the
cause
of
acute
flank
pain
The
room
time
for
CT
averaged
26
min
compared
to
69
min
for
intravenous
urography
(IVU)
The
charge
for
CT
was
$600
compared
to
$400
for
IVU
in
our
institution
Unenhanced
helical
CT
was
fast
and
accurate
in
determining
the
cause
of
colic
and
proved
to
be
highly
accurate
for
emergency
situations
