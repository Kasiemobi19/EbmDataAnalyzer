Title
Brain
reserve
and
dementia
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
Behavioural
brain
reserve
is
a
property
of
the
central
nervous
system
related
to
sustained
and
complex
mental
activity
which
can
lead
to
differential
expression
of
brain
injury
Behavioural
brain
reserve
has
been
assessed
using
autobiographical
data
such
as
education
levels
occupational
complexity
and
mentally
stimulating
lifestyle
pursuits
So
far
there
have
been
several
epidemiological
reports
but
no
systematic
review
to
put
conflicting
results
into
context
Our
aim
was
to
quantitatively
review
evidence
for
the
effect
of
brain
reserve
on
incident
dementia
Cohort
studies
of
the
effects
of
education
occupation
premorbid
IQ
and
mental
activities
on
dementia
risk
were
of
interest
Abstracts

identified

and

from
relevant
articles
Twenty-two
studies
met
inclusion
criteria
Key
information
was
extracted
by
both
reviewers
onto
a
standard
template
with
a
high
level
of
agreement
Studies
were
combined
through
a
quantitative
random-effects
meta-analysis
Higher
brain
reserve
was
associated
with
a
lowered
risk
for
incident
dementia
(summary
odds
ratio
054
95%
confidence
interval
049-059)
This
effect
was
found
over
a
median
of
71
years
follow-up
and
resulted
from
integrating
data
across
more
than
29000
individuals
Notably
increased
complex
mental
activity
in
late
life
was
associated
with
lower
dementia
rates
independent
of
other
predictors
a
dose-response
relationship
was
also
evident
between
extent
of
complex
mental
activities
in
late
life
and
dementia
risk
This
study
demonstrates
robust
evidence
that
complex
patterns
of
mental
activity
in
the
early
mid-
and
late-life
stages
is
associated
with
a
significant
reduction
in
dementia
incidence
Randomized
control
trials
based
on
brain-reserve
principles
are
now
required
