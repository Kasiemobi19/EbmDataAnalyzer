High
versus
low
doses
of
unfractionated
heparin
for
the
treatment
of
superficial
thrombophlebitis
of
the
leg
A
prospective
controlled
randomized
study
Abstract
Text
The
optimal
treatment
of
superficial
thrombophlebitis
of
the
leg
is
undefined
The
main
study
objective
was
to
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
unmonitored
high
doses
as
compared
to
low
doses
of
unfractionated
heparin
(UFH)
for
prevention
of
venous
thromboembolic
complications
in
patients
with
superficial
thrombophlebitis
of
the
thigh
Sixty
consecutive
patients
with
acute
thrombophlebitis
of
the
great
saphenous
vein
as
assessed
by
ultrasonography
were
randomized
to
subcutaneous
injection
twice
daily
of
UFH
in
high
unmonitored
doses
(12500
IU
for
one
week
followed
by
10000
IU)
or
prophylactic
doses
(5000
IU)
for
four
weeks
The
rate
of
asymptomatic
involvement
of
the
deep
venous
system
and/or
symptomatic
thromboembolic
events
during
a
six-month
follow-up
period
was
assessed
and
compared
between
the
two
study
groups
Six
of
the
30
patients
(200
%
95%
CI
77
to
386)
randomized
to
low-dose
UFH
developed
symptomatic
or
asymptomatic
events
as
compared
to
1
of
the
30
patients
(33%
95%
CI
007
to
172)
who
received
high-dose
UFH
(p=005
by
one-sided
Fisher's
exact
test)
No
patient
experienced
major
bleeding
complications
in
either
group
The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
in
patients
with
acute
thrombophlebitis
of
the
thigh
unmonitored
high
doses
of
UFH
are
more
effective
than
prophylactic
doses
of
UFH
for
prevention
of
venous
thromboembolic
complications
and
do
not
enhance
the
risk
of
bleeding
complications
