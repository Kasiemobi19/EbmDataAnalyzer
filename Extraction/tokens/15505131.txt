Early

Abstract
Text
There
is
increasing
interest
in
the
non-lipid-lowering
effects
of
statins
and
their
effect
on
outcomes
in
patients
with
acute
coronary
syndrome
It
has
been
suggested
that
withdrawal
of
statin
therapy
during
an
acute
coronary
syndrome
may
attenuate
any
benefits
of
pretreatment
thereby
providing
indirect
evidence
of
the
importance
of
their
non-lipid-lowering
effects
This
observational
study
compared
the
demographic
and
clinical
characteristics
and
hospital
outcomes
in
patients
with
non-ST-segment
elevation
myocardial
infarction
enrolled
in
the
National
Registry
of
Myocardial
Infarction

Comparison
groups
consisted
of
patients
previously
receiving
statins
who
also
received
statins
within
24
hours
of
hospital
admission
(n
=
9001)
patients
previously
using
statins
in
whom
therapy
was
discontinued
(n
=
4870)
and
patients
who
did
not
receive
statins
at
any
time
before
or
during
hospitalization
(n
=
54635)
Of
13871
patients
receiving
statins
before
hospital
admission
351%
had
treatment
withdrawn
during
the
first
24
hours
of
hospitalization
These
patients
had
increased
hospital
morbidity
and
mortality
rates
relative
to
patients
in
whom
therapy
was
continued
with
higher
rates
of
heart
failure
ventricular
arrhythmias
shock
and
death
In
multivariate
analyses
these
patients
were
at
statistically
significant
increased
risk
of
hospital
death
compared
with
those
continuing
statin
therapy
and
at
similar
risk
compared
with
those
not
receiving
statins
before
or
during
hospitalization
Withdrawal
of
statin
therapy
in
the
first
24
hours
of
hospitalization
for
non-ST-segment
elevation
myocardial
infarction
is
associated
with
worse
hospital
outcomes
In
the
absence
of
data
from
randomized
clinical
trials
our
findings
suggest
that
statin
therapy
should
be
continued
during
hospitalization
for
myocardial
infarction
unless
strongly
contraindicated
