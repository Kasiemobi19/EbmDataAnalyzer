Abstract
Text
"The
Seventh
Report
of
the
Joint
National
Committee
on
Prevention
Detection
Evaluation
and
Treatment
of
High
Blood
Pressure"
provides
a
new
guideline
for
hypertension
prevention
and
management
The
following
are
the
key
messages(1)
In
persons
older
than
50
years
systolic
blood
pressure
(BP)
of
more
than
140
mm
Hg
is
a
much
more
important
cardiovascular
disease
(CVD)
risk
factor
than
diastolic
BP
(2)
The
risk
of
CVD
beginning
at
115/75
mm
Hg
doubles
with
each
increment
of
20/10
mm
Hg
individuals
who
are
normotensive
at
55
years
of
age
have
a
90%
lifetime
risk
for
developing
hypertension
(3)
Individuals
with
a
systolic
BP
of
120
to
139
mm
Hg
or
a
diastolic
BP
of
80
to
89
mm
Hg
should
be
considered
as
prehypertensive
and
require
health-promoting
lifestyle
modifications
to
prevent
CVD
(4)
Thiazide-type
diuretics
should
be
used
in
drug
treatment
for
most
patients
with
uncomplicated
hypertension
either
alone
or
combined
with
drugs
from
other
classes
Certain
high-risk
conditions
are
compelling
indications
for
the
initial
use
of
other
antihypertensive
drug
classes
(angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
angiotensin-receptor
blockers
beta-blockers
calcium
channel
blockers)
(5)
Most
patients
with
hypertension
will
require
2
or
more
antihypertensive
medications
to
achieve
goal
BP
(<140/90
mm
Hg
or
<130/80
mm
Hg
for
patients
with
diabetes
or
chronic
kidney
disease)
(6)
If
BP
is
more
than
20/10
mm
Hg
above
goal
BP
consideration
should
be
given
to
initiating
therapy
with
2
agents
1
of
which
usually
should
be
a
thiazide-type
diuretic
and
(7)
The
most
effective
therapy
prescribed
by
the
most
careful
clinician
will
control
hypertension
only
if
patients
are
motivated
Motivation
improves
when
patients
have
positive
experiences
with
and
trust
in
the
clinician
Empathy
builds
trust
and
is
a
potent
motivator
Finally
in
presenting
these
guidelines
the
committee
recognizes
that
the
responsible
physician's
judgment
remains
paramount
