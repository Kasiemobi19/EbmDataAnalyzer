Patients'
and
physicians'
attitudes
regarding
the
disclosure
of
medical
errors
Abstract
Text
Despite
the
best
efforts
of
health
care
practitioners
medical
errors
are
inevitable
Disclosure
of
errors
to
patients
is
desired
by
patients
and
recommended
by
ethicists
and
professional
organizations
but
little
is
known
about
how
patients
and
physicians
think
medical
errors
should
be
discussed
To
determine
patients'
and
physicians'
attitudes
about
error
disclosure
Thirteen
focus
groups
were
organized
including
6
groups
of
adult
patients
4
groups
of
academic
and
community
physicians
and
3
groups
of
both
physicians
and
patients
A
total
of
52
patients
and
46
physicians
participated
Qualitative
analysis
of
focus
group
transcripts
to
determine
the
attitudes
of
patients
and
physicians
about
medical
error
disclosure
whether
physicians
disclose
the
information
patients
desire
and
patients'
and
physicians'
emotional
needs
when
an
error
occurs
and
whether
these
needs
are
met
Both
patients
and
physicians
had
unmet
needs
following
errors
Patients
wanted
disclosure
of
all
harmful
errors
and
sought
information
about
what
happened
why
the
error
happened
how
the
error's
consequences
will
be
mitigated
and
how
recurrences
will
be
prevented
Physicians
agreed
that
harmful
errors
should
be
disclosed
but
"choose
their
words
carefully"
when
telling
patients
about
errors
Although
physicians
disclosed
the
adverse
event
they
often
avoided
stating
that
an
error
occurred
why
the
error
happened
or
how
recurrences
would
be
prevented
Patients
also
desired
emotional
support
from
physicians
following
errors
including
an
apology
However
physicians
worried
that
an
apology
might
create
legal
liability
Physicians
were
also
upset
when
errors
happen
but
were
unsure
where
to
seek
emotional
support
Physicians
may
not
be
providing
the
information
or
emotional
support
that
patients
seek
following
harmful
medical
errors
Physicians
should
strive
to
meet
patients'
desires
for
an
apology
and
for
information
on
the
nature
cause
and
prevention
of
errors
Institutions
should
also
address
the
emotional
needs
of
practitioners
who
are
involved
in
medical
errors
