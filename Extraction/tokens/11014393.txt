Topical
lidocaine
patch
relieves
a
variety
of
neuropathic
pain
conditions
an
open-label
study
Abstract
Text
Our
goal
was
to
perform
a
pilot
study
to
assess
the
effectiveness
and
tolerability
of
a
topical
lidocaine
patch
(Lidoderm)
for
the
treatment
of
peripheral
neuropathic
pain
conditions
other
than
postherpetic
neuralgia
This
was
an
open-label
prospective
study
Sixteen
patients
with
refractory
peripheral
neuropathic
pain
conditions
who
had
reported
intolerable
side
effects
or
inadequate
pain
relief
with
antidepressant
anticonvulsant
antiarrhythmic
and
opioid
medications
participated
in
this
study
Diagnoses
included
postthoracotomy
pain
stump
neuroma
pain
intercostal
neuralgia
diabetic
polyneuropathy
meralgia
paresthetica
complex
regional
pain
syndrome
radiculopathy
and
postmastectomy
pain
A
six-item
Pain
Relief
Scale
was
used
(0
=
worse
pain
1
=
no
change
2
=
slight
relief
3
=
moderate
relief
4
=
a
lot
of
relief
5
=
complete
relief)
Moderate
or
better
pain
relief
was
reported
by
13
of
the
16
participants
(81%)
One
patient
stopped
treatment
after
4
days
due
to
lack
of
relief
The
remaining
15
patients
had
a
mean
duration
of
patch
use
of
62
weeks
with
continued
relief
Only
1
patient
reported
a
side
effect
a
mild
skin
irritation
The
Lidoderm
patch
provided
clinically
meaningful
pain
relief
in
most
of
these
refractory
neuropathic
pain
patients
without
side
effects
Controlled
trials
need
to
be
performed
to
confirm
these
preliminary
findings
