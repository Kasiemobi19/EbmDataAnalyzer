Anti-thyroid
peroxidase
antibodies
in
thyroid

non-thyroid
autoimmune

Abstract
Text
A
new
commercial
method
for
measurement
of
anti-thyroid
peroxidase
(anti-TPO
DYNOtest
Henning
Berlin)
was
evaluated
in
normal
subjects
and
in
patients
with
autoimmune
thyroid
and
non-thyroid
diseases
and
compared
to
an
immune
fluorescence
method
for
measurement
of
anti-microsomal
antibodies
(MicAb)
and
a
radioimmunological
method
for
quantifying
thyroglobulin
antibodies
(TgAb)
The
majority
of
normal
subjects
had
anti-TPO
levels
below
52
U/ml
and
patients
with
Hashimoto's
thyroiditis
had
levels
above
200
U/ml
with
a
good
correlation
to
MicAb
In
other
autoimmune
thyroid
diseases
the
correlation
was
less
pronounced
In
non-thyroid
autoimmune
diseases
MicAb
showed
falsely
positive
reactions
in
the
presence
of
other
autoantibodies
eg
mitochondrial
antibodies
The
present
study
indicates
that
the
anti-TPO
method
should
probably
replace
measurements
of
MicAb
for
routine
clinical
use
thus
providing
a
sensitive
precise
antigen
specific
method
with
the
ability
to
reveal
quantitative
fluctuations
The
study
also
indicates
that
TgAb
could
be
abolished
in
routine
diagnosis
of
autoimmune
thyroid
diseases
and
be
reserved
for
special
clinical
situations
research
purposes
as
well
as
measurement
in
sera
before
evaluation
of
serum
thyroglobulin
levels
