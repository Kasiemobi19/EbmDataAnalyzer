The
efficacy
of
influenza
vaccine
in
elderly
persons
A
meta-analysis
and
review
of
the
literature
Abstract
Text
To
quantify
the
protective
efficacy
of
influenza
vaccine
in
elderly
persons
A
MEDLINE
search
was
done
using
the
index
terms
influenza
vaccine
vaccine
efficacy
elderly
mortality
hospitalized
and
pneumonia
Appropriate
references
in
the
initially
selected
articles
were
also
reviewed
Only
cohort
observational
studies
with
mortality
assessment
were
included
in
the
meta-analysis
In
addition
3
recent
case-control
studies
2
cost-effectiveness
studies
and
1
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
were
reviewed
Vaccine
and
epidemic
virus
strains
age
and
sex
of
patients
severity
of
illness
patient
status
and
study
design
were
recorded
Upper
respiratory
illness
hospitalization
pneumonia
and
mortality
were
used
as
outcome
measures
In
a
meta-analysis
of
20
cohort
studies
the
pooled
estimates
of
vaccine
efficacy
(1-odds
ratio)
were
56%
(95%
Cl
39%
to
68%)
for
preventing
respiratory
illness
53%
(Cl
35%
to
66%)
for
preventing
pneumonia
50%
(Cl
28%
to
65%)
for
preventing
hospitalization
and
68%
(Cl
56%
to
76%)
for
preventing
death
Vaccine
efficacy
in
the
case-control
studies
ranged
from
32%
to
45%
for
preventing
hospitalization
for
pneumonia
from
31%
to
65%
for
preventing
hospital
deaths
from
pneumonia
and
influenza
from
43%
to
50%
for
preventing
hospital
deaths
from
all
respiratory
conditions
and
from
27%
to
30%
for
preventing
deaths
from
all
causes
The
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
showed
a
50%
or
greater
reduction
in
influenza-related
illness
Recent
cost-effectiveness
studies
confirm
the
efficacy
of
influenza
vaccine
in
reducing
influenza-related
morbidity
and
mortality
and
show
that
vaccine
provides
important
cost
savings
per
year
per
vaccinated
person
Despite
the
paucity
of
randomized
trials
many
studies
confirm
that
influenza
vaccine
reduces
the
risks
for
pneumonia
hospitalization
and
death
in
elderly
persons
during
an
influenza
epidemic
if
the
vaccine
strain
is
identical
or
similar
to
the
epidemic
strain
Influenza
immunization
is
an
indispensable
part
of
the
care
of
persons
65
years
of
age
and
older
Annual
vaccine
administration
requires
the
attention
of
all
physicians
and
public
health
organizations
