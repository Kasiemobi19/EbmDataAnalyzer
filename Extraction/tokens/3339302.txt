A
one-year
follow-up
of
fatigued
patients
Abstract
Text
To
better
understand
the
complaint
"fatigue"
and
the
characteristic
features
of
patients
who
present
with
this
problem
a
one-year
follow-up
study
was
performed
in
a
county
health
center
One
hundred-fifteen
fatigued
adults
were
identified
using
scores
on
the
Rand
Index
of
Vitality
(RIV)
One
hundred
thirty-nine
patients
of
similar
age
sex
and
socioeconomic
status
were
identified
as
nonfatigued
One
year
later
these
patients
were
followed
up
with
a
chart
review
reassessment
of
fatigue
(by
RIV
score)
and
a
telephone
interview
Seventy-three
(64
percent)
fatigued
and
72
(53
percent)
nonfatigued
patients
provided
this
information
On
the
RIV
31
patients
moved
from
the
fatigued
group
to
nonfatigued
and
15
nonfatigued
patients'
scores
changed
to
the
fatigued
category
Patients
categorized
as
fatigued
in
1984
(by
RIV
score)
returned
for
office
visits
more
often
(mean
of
385
vs
251
P
less
than
05)
and
developed
significantly
more
new
diagnoses
(275
vs
168
P
less
than
05)
over
the
follow-up
year
compared
with
those
not
fatigued
Fatigued
patients
also
had
a
greater
proportion
of
diagnoses
containing
a
psychologic
component
than
nonfatigued
patients
Persistence
of
fatigue
over
the
year
was
significantly
associated
with
race
and
education
(nonwhites
and
those
completing
high
school
remaining
fatigued)
No
significant
association
between
marital
status
age
sex
employment
status
and
either
the
resolution
or
development
of
fatigue
over
the
year
was
found
