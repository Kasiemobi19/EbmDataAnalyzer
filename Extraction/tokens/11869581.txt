Title
Multidisciplinary
bio-psycho-social
rehabilitation
for
chronic
low
back
pain
Abstract
Text
Chronic
low
back
pain
is
in
many
countries
the
main
cause
of
long
term
disability
in
middle
age
Patients
with
chronic
low
back
pain
are
often
referred
for
multidisciplinary
treatment
Previous
published
systematic
reviews
on
this
topic
included
no
randomised
controlled
trials
and
pooled
together
controlled
and
non-controlled
studies
To
assess
the
effect
of
multidisciplinary
bio-psycho-social
rehabilitation
on
pain
function
employment
quality
of
life
and
global
assessment
outcomes
in
subjects
with
chronic
disabling
low
back
pain
We
searched

Health
STAR
and
The
Cochrane
Library
from
the
beginning
of
the
database
to
June
1998
using
the
comprehensive
search
strategy
recommended
by

We
also

Design
randomised
controlled
trials
comparing
multidisciplinary
bio-psycho-social
rehabilitation
with
a
non-multidisciplinary
control
intervention
Population
Adults
with
disabling
low
back
pain
of
more
than
three
months
in
duration
Intervention
Patients
had
to
be
assessed
and
treated
by
qualified
professionals
according
to
a
plan
that
addresses
physical
and
at
least
one
of
psychological
or
social/occupational
dimensions
Outcomes
Only
trials
which
reported
treatment
effect
in
at
least
one
of
pain
function
employment
status
quality
of
life
or
global
improvement
Exclusion
Pure
educational
interventions
(back
schools)
and
pure
physical
interventions
were
excluded
Selection
data
extraction
and
quality
grading
of
studies
was
done
by
two
independent
reviewers
using
pre-tested
data
forms
Study
quality
was
assessed
according
to
the
scheme
recommended
by
the
Back
Review
Group
of
the
Cochrane
Collaboration
Trials
with
internal
validity
scores
of
five
or
more
in
a
ten
point
scale
were
considered
high
quality
Discrepancies
between
reviewers
were
resolved
by
consensus
or
by
a
third
reviewer
Given
the
marked
heterogeneity
in
study
settings
interventions
and
control
groups
we
decided
not
to
pool
trial
results
in
a
meta-analysis
Instead
we
summarized
findings
by
strength
of
evidence
and
nature
of
intervention
and
control
treatments
The
evidence
was
judged
to
be
strong
when
multiple
high
quality
trials
produced
generally
consistent
findings
It
was
judged
to
be
moderate
when
multiple
low
quality
or
one
high
quality
and
one
or
more
low
quality
trials
produced
generally
consistent
findings
Evidence
was
considered
to
be
limited
when
only
one
randomised
trial
existed
or
if
findings
of
existing
trials
were
inconsistent
Ten
trials
(12
randomised
comparisons)
were
included
They
randomised
a
total
of
1964
patients
with
chronic
low
back
pain
There
was
strong
evidence
that
intensive
multidisciplinary
bio-psycho-social
rehabilitation
with
a
functional
restoration
approach
improved
function
when
compared
with
inpatient
or
outpatient
non-multidisciplinary
treatments
There
was
moderate
evidence
that
intensive
multidisciplinary
bio-psycho-social
rehabilitation
with
a
functional
restoration
approach
improved
pain
when
compared
with
outpatient
non-multidisciplinary
rehabilitation
or
usual
care
There
was
contradictory
evidence
regarding
vocational
outcomes
of
intensive
multidisciplinary
bio-psycho-social
intervention
Some
trials
reported
improvements
in
work
readiness
but
others
showed
no
significant
reduction
in
sickness
leaves
Less
intensive
outpatient
psycho-physical
treatments
did
not
improve
pain
function
or
vocational
outcomes
when
compared
with
non-multidisciplinary
outpatient
therapy
or
usual
care
Few
trials
reported
effects
on
quality
of
life
or
global
assessments
The
reviewed
trials
provide
evidence
that
intensive
multidisciplinary
bio-psycho-social
rehabilitation
with
a
functional
restoration
approach
improves
pain
and
function
Less
intensive
interventions
did
not
show
improvements
in
clinically
relevant
outcomes
