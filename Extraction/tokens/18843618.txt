Title
Surgical
versus
non-surgical
treatment
for
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
Abstract
Text
Carpal
tunnel
syndrome
results
from
entrapment
of
the
median
nerve
in
the
wrist
Common
symptoms
are
tingling
numbness
and
pain
in
the
hand
that
may
radiate
to
the
forearm
or
shoulder
Most
symptomatic
cases
are
treated
non-surgically
The
objective
is
to
compare
the
efficacy
of
surgical
treatment
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
with
non-surgical
treatment
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Neuromuscular
Disease
Group
Trials
Register
(January
2008)
MEDLINE
(January
1966
to
January
2008)
EMBASE
(January
1980
to
January
2008)
and
LILACS
(January
1982
to
January
2008)
We
checked
bibliographies
in
papers
and
contacted
authors
for
information
about
other
published
or
unpublished
studies
We
included
all
randomised
and
quasi-randomised
controlled
trials
comparing
any
surgical
and
any
non-surgical
therapies
Two
authors
independently
assessed
the
eligibility
of
the
trials
In
this
update
we
found
four
randomised
controlled
trials
involving
317
participants
in
total
Three
of
them
including
295
participants
148
allocated
to
surgery
and
147
to
non-surgical
treatment
reported
information
on
our
primary
outcome
(improvement
at
three
months
of
follow-up)
The
pooled
estimate
favoured
surgery
(RR
123
95%
CI
104
to
146)
Two
trials
including
245
participants
described
outcome
at
six
month
follow-up
also
favouring
surgery
(RR
119
95%
CI
102
to
139)Two
trials
reported
clinical
improvement
at
one
year
follow-up
They
included
198
patients
favouring
surgery
(RR
127
95%
CI
105
to
153)
The
only
trial
describing
changes
in
neurophysiological
parameters
in
both
groups
also
favoured
surgery
(RR
144
95%
CI
105
to
197)
Two
trials
described
need
for
surgery
during
follow-up
including
198
patients
The
pooled
estimate
for
this
outcome
indicates
that
a
significant
proportion
of
people
treated
medically
will
require
surgery
while
the
risk
of
re-operation
in
surgically
treated
people
is
low
(RR
004
favouring
surgery
95%
CI
001
to
017)
Complications
of
surgery
and
medical
treatment
were
described
by
two
trials
with
226
participants
Although
the
incidence
of
complications
was
high
in
both
groups
they
were
significantly
more
common
in
the
surgical
arm
(RR
138
95%
CI
108
to
176)
Surgical
treatment
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
relieves
symptoms
significantly
better
than
splinting
Further
research
is
needed
to
discover
whether
this
conclusion
applies
to
people
with
mild
symptoms
and
whether
surgical
treatment
is
better
than
steroid
injection
