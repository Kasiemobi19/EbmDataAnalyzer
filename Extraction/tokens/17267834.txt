Venous

Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
incidence
of
venous
thromboembolism
acute
myocardial
infarction
and
ischemic
stroke
among
transdermal
contraceptive
system
users
compared
with
users
of
norgestimate-containing
oral
contraceptives
with
35
mcg
ethinyl
estradiol
We
began
with
insurance
claims
data
from
UnitedHealthcare
We
identified
women
exposed
to
the
transdermal
contraceptive
system
or
norgestimate-containing
oral
contraceptives
from
April
2002
through
December
2004
Outcomes
were
confirmed
from
medical
records
We
calculated
incidence
rates
and
age-adjusted
incidence
rate
ratios
In
a
nested
case-control
analysis
we
investigated
and
controlled
for
confounding
There
were
49048
woman-years
of
transdermal
contraceptive
system
exposure
and
202344
woman-years
of
norgestimate-containing
oral
contraceptives
exposure
There
was
a
more
than
two-fold
increase
in
the
venous
thromboembolism
rate
(incidence
rate
ratio
22
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
13-38)
among
transdermal
contraceptive
system
users
(20
cases
408
per
100000
woman-years)
compared
with
norgestimate-containing
oral
contraceptives
users
(37
cases
183
per
100000
woman-years)
Acute
myocardial
infarction
occurred
in
three
transdermal
contraceptive
system
users
compared
with
seven
among
norgestimate-containing
oral
contraceptives
users
(incidence
rate
ratio
18
95%
CI
05-68)
No
strokes
occurred
among
transdermal
contraceptive
system
users
whereas
10
occurred
among
norgestimate-containing
oral
contraceptives
users
In
the
nested
case-control
analysis
after
exclusions
for
high-risk
factors
the
odds
ratio
for
venous
thromboembolism
was
24
(95%
CI
11-55)
There
was
a
more
than
two-fold
increase
in
the
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
associated
with
use
of
the
transdermal
contraceptive
system
Acute
myocardial
infarction
and
stroke
occurred
too
rarely
to
ascertain
precise
risk
estimates
