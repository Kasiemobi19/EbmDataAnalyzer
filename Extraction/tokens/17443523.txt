Title
Ginkgo
biloba
for
cognitive
impairment
and
dementia
Abstract
Text
Extracts
of
the
leaves
of
the
maidenhair
tree
Ginkgo
biloba
have
long
been
used
in
China
as
a
traditional
medicine
for
various
disorders
of
health
A
standardized
extract
is
widely
prescribed
for
the
treatment
of
a
range
of
conditions
including
memory
and
concentration
problems
confusion
depression
anxiety
dizziness
tinnitus
and
headache
The
mechanisms
of
action
are
thought
to
reflect
the
action
of
several
components
of
the
extract
and
include
increasing
blood
supply
by
dilating
blood
vessels
reducing
blood
viscosity
modification
of
neurotransmitter
systems
and
reducing
the
density
of
oxygen
free
radicals
To
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
Ginkgo
biloba
for
dementia
or
cognitive
decline
Trials
were
identified
on
10
October
2006
through
a
search
of
the
Cochrane
Dementia
and
Cognitive
Improvement
Group's
Specialized
Register
which
contains
records
from
all
main
medical
databases
(MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
PsycINFO
SIGLE
LILACS)
from
ongoing
trials
databases
such
as
Clinicaltrialsgov
and
Current
Controlled
Trials
and
many
other
sources
The

used
were

and

Randomized
double-blind
studies
in
which
extracts
of
Ginkgo
biloba
at
any
strength
and
over
any
period
were
compared
with
placebo
for
their
effects
on
people
with
acquired
cognitive
impairment
including
dementia
of
any
degree
of
severity
Data
were
extracted
from
the
published
reports
of
the
included
studies
pooled
where
appropriate
and
the
treatment
effects
or
the
risks
and
benefits
estimated
Clinical
global
improvement
as
assessed
by
the
physician
was
dichotomized
between
participants
who
showed
improvement
or
were
unchanged
and
those
who
were
worse
There
are
benefits
associated
with
Ginkgo
(dose
greater
than
200
mg/day)
at
24
weeks
(207/276
compared
with
178/273
OR

95%

(2
studies)
but
not
for
the
lower
dose
Cognition
shows
benefit
for
Ginkgo
(any
dose)
at
12
weeks
(SMD

but
not
at

Five
studies
assessed
activities
of
daily
living
(ADLs)
using
different
scales
Some
scales
are
more
comprehensive
than
just
ADLs
The
results
show
benefit
for
Ginkgo
(dose
less
than
200
mg/day)
compared
with
placebo
at
12
weeks
(MD

and
at

weeks
(SMD

studies)
but
there
are
no
differences
at
the
higher
dose
No
study
assessed
mood
and
function
separately
but
one
study
used
the
ADAS-Noncog
which
assesses
function
over
several
domains
but
not
cognitive
function
There
was
no
difference
between
Ginkgo
and
placebo
There
are
no
significant
differences
between
Ginkgo
and
placebo
in
the
proportion
of
participants
experiencing
adverse
events
There
are
no
data
available
on
Quality
of
Life
measures
of
depression
or
dependency
Ginkgo
biloba
appears
to
be
safe
in
use
with
no
excess
side
effects
compared
with
placebo
Many
of
the
early
trials
used
unsatisfactory
methods
were
small
and
we
cannot
exclude
publication
bias
The
evidence
that
Ginkgo
has
predictable
and
clinically
significant
benefit
for
people
with
dementia
or
cognitive
impairment
is
inconsistent
and
unconvincing
