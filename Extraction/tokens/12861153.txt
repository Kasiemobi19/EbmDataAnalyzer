Bacterial
vaginosis
as
a
risk
factor
for
preterm
delivery
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
We
performed
a
meta-analysis
to
evaluate
bacterial
vaginosis
as
a
risk
factor
for
preterm
delivery
Selection
criteria
were
(1)
the
data
appeared
in
original
published
English-language
reports
of
prospective
studies
or
control
groups
of
clinical
trials
that
included
women
at
<37
weeks
of
gestation
with
intact
amniotic
membranes
(2)
all
the
women
had
to
have
been
screened
for
bacterial
vaginosis
that
was
diagnosed
by
either
clinical
criteria
or
criteria
that
were
based
on
Gram
stain
findings
and
(3)
the
outcomes
were
preterm
delivery
spontaneous
abortion
maternal
or
neonatal
infection
and
perinatal
death
Eighteen
studies
with
results
for
20232
patients
were
included
Bacterial
vaginosis
increased
the
risk
of
preterm
delivery
>2-fold
(odds
ratio
219
95%
CI
154-312)
Higher
risks
were
calculated
for
subgroups
of
studies
that
screened
for
bacterial
vaginosis
at
<16
weeks
of
gestation
(odds
ratio
755
95%
CI
180-3165)
or
at
<20
weeks
of
gestation
(odds
ratio
420
95%
CI
211-839)
Bacterial
vaginosis
also
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
spontaneous
abortion
(odds
ratio
991
95%
CI
199-4934)
and
maternal
infection
(odds
ratio
253
95%
CI
126-508)
No
significant
results
were
calculated
for
the
outcome
of
neonatal
infection
or
perinatal
death
Bacterial
vaginosis
early
in
pregnancy
is
a
strong
risk
factor
for
preterm
delivery
and
spontaneous
abortion
