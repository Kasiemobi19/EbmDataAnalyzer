Interaction
between
exercise
training
and
ejection
fraction
in
predicting
prognosis
after
a
first
myocardial
infarction
Abstract
Text
Although
recent
meta-analysis
trials
have
shown
that
exercise
training
may
improve
survival
after
myocardial
infarction
the
mechanism
of
this
beneficial
effect
is
still
unknown
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
detect
possible
interactions
between
exercise
training
and
predictors
of
prognosis
after
a
first
myocardial
infarction
Patients
with
uneventful
clinical
courses
after
a
first
myocardial
infarction
were
randomly
assigned
to
a
4-week
training
period
(125
patients
group
1)
or
to
a
control
group
(131
patients
group
2)
Before
randomization
all
patients
underwent
a
symptom-limited
exercise
test
(28
+/-
2
days
after
myocardial
infarction)
24-hour
Holter
monitoring
and
coronary
arteriography
(31
+/-
3
days
after
the
acute
episode)
After
a
mean
follow-up
period
of
345
months
18
patients
had
cardiac
deaths
(5
in
group
1
and
13
in
group
2)
Multivariate
analysis
by
Cox
regression
model
showed
that
ejection
fraction
was
the
only
independent
prognostic
indicator
(P
=
03)
Evidence
existed
of
an
interaction
between
ejection
fraction
and
exercise
training
showing
an
effect
of
physical
training
on
survival
that
depended
on
the
patient's
ejection
fraction
Among
patients
with
ejection
fractions
<
41%
the
relative
risk
for
an
untrained
patient
was
863
times
higher
than
for
a
trained
patient
(P
=
04)
whereas
for
ejection
fractions
>
40%
the
estimated
risks
for
trained
and
untrained
patients
were
similar
These
data
show
that
exercise
training
may
prolong
survival
in
post-myocardial
infarction
patients
with
depressed
left
ventricular
function
A
randomized
trial
in
such
patients
seems
warranted
