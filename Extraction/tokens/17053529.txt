strong
is
the
evidence

use

beta-blockers
as
first-line

Systematic

Abstract
Text
To
quantify
the
effect
of
first-line
antihypertensive
treatment
with
beta-blockers
on
mortality
morbidity
and
withdrawal
rates
compared
with
the
other
main
classes
of
antihypertensive
agents
We
identified
eligible
trials
by
searching
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
Medline
Embase
reference
lists
of
previous
reviews
and
contacting
researchers
We
extracted
data
independently
in
duplicate
and
conducted
meta-analysis
by
analysing
trial
participants
in
groups
to
which
they
were
randomized
regardless
of
subsequent
treatment
actually
received
Thirteen
trials
with
91561
participants
meeting
inclusion
criteria
compared
beta-blockers
to
placebo
(four
trials
n
=
23613)
diuretics
(five
trials
n
=
18241)
calcium-channel
blockers
(CCBs)
(four
trials
n
=
44825)
and
renin-angiotensin
system
(RAS)
inhibitors
namely
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
or
angiotensin
receptor
blockers
(three
trials
n
=
10828)
Compared
to
placebo
beta-blockers
reduced
the
risk
of
stroke
(relative
risk
080
95%
confidence
interval
066-096)
with
a
marginal
fall
in
total
cardiovascular
events
(088
079-097)
but
did
not
affect
all-cause
mortality
(099
088-111)
coronary
heart
disease
(093
081-107)
or
cardiovascular
mortality
(093
080-109)
The
effect
on
stroke
was
less
than
that
of
CCBs
(124
111-140)
and
RAS
inhibitors
(130
111-153)
and
that
on
total
cardiovascular
events
less
than
that
of
CCBs
(118
108-129)
In
addition
patients
on
beta-blockers
were
more
likely
to
discontinue
treatment
than
those
on
diuretics
(180
133-242)
or
RAS
inhibitors
(141
129-154)
Beta-blockers
are
inferior
to
CCBs
and
to
RAS
inhibitors
for
reducing
several
important
hard
end
points
Compared
with
diuretics
they
had
similar
outcomes
but
were
less
well
tolerated
Hence
beta-blockers
are
generally
suboptimal
first-line
antihypertensive
drugs
