Penicillin
plus
rifampin
eradicates
pharyngeal

of
group

Abstract
Text
We
evaluated
the
efficacy
of
rifampin
in
eradicating
chronic
pharyngeal
carriage
of
group
A
streptococci
Carriers
were
defined
as
healthy
children
whose
throat
cultures
showed
persistence
of
group
A
streptococci
3
weeks
after
receiving
benzathine
penicillin
G
intramuscularly
Subsequent
M
and
T
typing
of
group
A
streptococcal
isolates
and
limited
serologic
studies
confirmed
that
enrolled
patients
were
carriers
Thirty-eight
carriers
(37
completed
the
study)
were
randomly
assigned
to
three
groups
group
1
(13
patients)
received
no
treatment
group
2
(10)
received
benzathine
penicillin
intramuscularly
group
3
(14)
received
benzathine
penicillin
intramuscularly
plus
rifampin
orally
(10
mg/kg
twice
a
day
for
eight
doses)
Throat
cultures
were
obtained
every
3
weeks
for
at
least
9
weeks
Group
2
and
3
patients
who
still
had
positive
cultures
3
weeks
after
treatment
were
crossed
to
the
opposite
group
Cultures
became
negative
in
93%
(13
of
14)
of
patients
in
group
3
compared
with
23%
in
group
1
and
30%
in
group
2
(P
less
than
0001
and
P
less
than
001
respectively)
Including
patients
crossed
over
the
penicillin
plus
rifampin
regimen
was
effective
in
17
(89%)
of
19
treatment
courses
and
was
significantly
superior
to
no
therapy
or
to
penicillin
alone
(P
less
than
00005
and
P
less
than
0005
respectively)
We
conclude
that
rifampin
plus
benzathine
penicillin
intramuscularly
is
an
effective
regimen
for
those
selected
patients
in
whom
eradication
of
group
A
streptococcal
carriage
is
judged
to
be
desirable
