Use
of
thiazolidinediones
and
risk
of
heart
failure
in
people
with
type

a
retrospective
cohort
study
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
incidence
of
heart
failure
in
individuals
with
type
2
diabetes
receiving
thiazolidinediones
(TZDs)
versus
other
oral
antihyperglycemic
agents
We
conducted
a
retrospective
cohort
study
using
a
health
insurance
claims
database
The
study
sample
included
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
who
received
an
oral
antihyperglycemic
agent
between
January
1995
and
March
2001
Those
with
any
claims
for
TZDs
were
designated
"exposed"
and
each
was
compared
with
five
randomly
selected
unexposed
patients
Those
with
diagnoses
of
heart
failure
or
who
received
digoxin
or
a
diuretic
in
the
year
before
their
index
date
were
excluded
The
primary
measure
of
interest
was
incidence
of
heart
failure
which
was
defined
as
a
hospitalization
or
outpatient
visit
with
a
diagnosis
of
heart
failure
TZD
patients
(n
=
5441)
were
younger
than
control
subjects
(n
=
28103)
but
more
likely
to
have
coronary
artery
disease
or
diabetes
complications
receive
ACE
inhibitors
beta-blockers
metformin
or
insulin
and
have
undergone
HbA(1c)
tests
or
eye
exams
they
also
had
more
comorbidities
and
higher
costs
(all
P
<
005)
However
TZD
use
was
predictive
of
heart
failure
even
after
controlling
for
these
variables
(hazard
ratio
=
17
P
<
0001)
Adjusted
incidence
of
heart
failure
at
40
months
was
82%
for
TZD
patients
and
53%
for
control
subjects
The
results
of
this
observational
study
suggest
that
TZDs
may
increase
the
risk
of
heart
failure
Physicians
should
use
TZDs
with
caution
in
patients
with
heart
failure
remain
vigilant
for
manifestations
of
heart
failure
in
those
receiving
these
drugs
(especially
patients
with
cardiovasculopathy)
and
consider
alternate
therapies
for
patients
who
develop
symptoms
of
heart
failure
such
as
shortness
of
breath
