The
frequency
of
reactions
to
sunscreens
results
of
a
longitudinal
population-based
study
on
the
regular
use
of
sunscreens
in
Australia
Abstract
Text
Six-hundred-and-three
people
aged
40
or
more
years
from
Maryborough
in
central
Victoria
were
enrolled
in
a
randomized
longitudinal
study
which
required
daily
application
of
either
a
SPF
15+
broad-spectrum
water-resistant
sunscreen
cream
or
the
cream
base
without
the
active
ingredients
The
study
duration
was
7
months
from
September
1991
until
April
1992
One-hundred-and-fourteen
(189%)
of
these
subjects
developed
an
adverse
reaction
to
the
cream
they
were
applying
Patch
testing
photopatch
testing
and
scratch
testing
with
the
ingredients
of
the
creams
revealed
that
only
a
small
proportion
(<
10%)
of
the
inflammatory
eruptions
were
allergic
in
nature
None
of
the
people
tested
was
allergic
to
the
sunscreen
active
ingredients
History
and
examination
findings
where
available
suggested
that
the
majority
of
adverse
responses
were
consistent
with
an
irritant
reaction
both
to
the
sunscreen
preparation
and
the
base
cream
control
A
higher
than
expected
proportion
of
the
people
who
developed
an
adverse
reaction
had
a
personal
history
consistent
with
atopy
Other
reactions
included
acneiform
eruptions
and
contact
urticaria
A
frequency
of
reactions
to
sunscreen
preparations
of
over
15%
means
that
further
work
is
necessary
to
improve
both
the
formulation
of
such
products
and
the
manner
and
conditions
under
which
they
are
used
to
ensure
satisfactory
compliance
