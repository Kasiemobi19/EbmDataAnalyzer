Abstract

In
1997
the
National
Asthma
Education
and
Prevention
Program
(NAEPP)
coordinated
by
the
National
Heart
Lung
and
Blood
Institute
published
the
second

Subsequently
the
NAEPP
Expert
Panel
identified
key
questions
regarding
asthma
management
that
were
submitted
to
an
evidence
practice
center
of
the
Agency
for
Healthcare
Research
and
Quality
to
conduct
a
systematic
review
of
the
evidence
The
resulting
evidence
report
was
used
by
the
Expert
Panel
to
update
recommendations
for
clinical
practice
on
selected
topics
These
recommendations
(EPR-Update
2002)
were
published
in
2002

To
improve
the
implementation
of
these
guidelines
a
working
group
of
the
Professional
Education
Subcommittee
of
the
NAEPP
extracted
key
clinical
activities
that
should
be
considered
as
essential
for
quality
asthma
care
in
accordance
with
the
EPR-2
guidelines
and
the
EPR-Update
2002
The
purpose
was
to
develop
a
report
that
would
help
purchasers
and
planners
of
health
care
define
the
activities
that
are
important
to
quality
asthma
care
particularly
in
reducing
symptoms
and
preventing
exacerbations
and
subsequently
reducing
the
overall
national
burden
of
illness
and
death
from
asthma
This
report
is
intended
to
help
employer
health
benefits
managers
and
other
health-care
planners
make
decisions
regarding
delivery
of
health
care
for
persons
with
asthma
Although
this
report
is
based
on
information
directed
to
clinicians
it
is
not
intended
to
substitute
for
recommended
clinical
practices
for
caring
for
persons
with
asthma
nor
is
it
intended
to
replace
the
clinical
decision-making
required
to
meet
individual
patient
needs
Readers
are
referred
to
the
EPR-2
for
the
full
asthma
guidelines
regarding
diagnosis
and
management
of
asthma

and
to
the
EPR-Update
2002
The
1997
EPR-2
guidelines
and
EPR-Update
2002
were
derived
from
a
consensus
of
leading
asthma
researchers
from
academic
clinical
federal
and
voluntary
institutions
and
based
on
scientific
evidence
supported
by
the
literature
The
10
key
activities
highlighted
here
correspond
to
the
four
recommended-as-essential
components
of
asthma
management
assessment
and
monitoring
control
of
factors
contributing
to
asthma
severity
pharmacotherapy
and
education
for
a
partnership
in
care
The
key
clinical
activities
are
not
intended
for
acute
or
hospital
management
of
patients
with
asthma
but
rather
for
the
preventive
aspects
of
managing
asthma
long
term
This
report
was
developed
as
a
collaborative
activity
between
CDC
and
the
NAEPP
