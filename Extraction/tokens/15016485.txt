Effects
of
cholesterol-lowering
with
simvastatin
on
stroke
and
other
major
vascular
events
in
20536
people
with
cerebrovascular
disease
or
other
high-risk
conditions
Abstract
Text
Lower
blood
cholesterol
concentrations
have
consistently
been
found
to
be
strongly
associated
with
lower
risks
of
coronary
disease
but
not
with
lower
risks
of
stroke
Despite
this
observation
previous
randomised
trials
had
indicated
that
cholesterol-lowering
statin
therapy
reduces
the
risk
of
stroke
but
large-scale
prospective
confirmation
has
been
needed
3280
adults
with
cerebrovascular
disease
and
an
additional
17256
with
other
occlusive
arterial
disease
or
diabetes
were
randomly
allocated
40
mg
simvastatin
daily
or
matching
placebo
Subgroup
analyses
were
prespecified
of
first
"major
vascular
event"
(ie
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
or
coronary
death
stroke
of
any
type
or
any
revascularisation
procedure)
in
prior
disease
subcategories
Subsidiary
outcomes
included
any
stroke
and
stroke
sub-type
Comparisons
are
of
all
simvastatin-allocated
versus
all
placebo-allocated
participants
(ie
"intention-to-treat")
which
yielded
an
average
difference
in
LDL
cholesterol
of
10
mmol/L
(39
mg/dL)
during
the
5-year
treatment
period
Overall
there
was
a
highly
significant
25%
(95%
CI
15-34)
proportional
reduction
in
the
first
event
rate
for
stroke
(444
[43%]
simvastatin
vs
585
[57%]
placebo
p<00001)
reflecting
a
definite
28%
(19-37)
reduction
in
presumed
ischaemic
strokes
(p<00001)
and
no
apparent
difference
in
strokes
attributed
to
haemorrhage
(51
[05%]
vs
53
[05%]
rate
ratio
095
[065-140]
p=08)
In
addition
simvastatin
reduced
the
numbers
having
transient
cerebral
ischaemic
attacks
alone
(20%
vs
24%
p=002)
or
requiring
carotid
endarterectomy
or
angioplasty
(04%
vs
08%
p=00003)
The
reduction
in
stroke
was
not
significant
during
the
first
year
but
was
already
significant
(p=00004)
by
the
end
of
the
second
year
Among
patients
with
pre-existing
cerebrovascular
disease
there
was
no
apparent
reduction
in
the
stroke
rate
but
there
was
a
highly
significant
20%
(8-29)
reduction
in
the
rate
of
any
major
vascular
event
(406
[247%]
vs
488
[298%]
p=0001)
The
proportional
reductions
in
stroke
were
about
one-quarter
in
each
of
the
other
subcategories
of
participant
studied
including
those
with
coronary
disease
or
diabetes
those
aged
under
or
over
70
years
at
entry
and
those
presenting
with
different
levels
of
blood
pressure
or
lipids
(even
when
the
pretreatment
LDL
cholesterol
was
below
30
mmol/L
[116
mg/dL])
Much
larger
numbers
of
people
in
the
present
study
suffered
a
stroke
than
in
any
previous
cholesterol-lowering
trial
The
results
demonstrate
that
statin
therapy
rapidly
reduces
the
incidence
not
only
of
coronary
events
but
also
of
ischaemic
strokes
with
no
apparent
effect
on
cerebral
haemorrhage
even
among
individuals
who
do
not
have
high
cholesterol
concentrations
Allocation
to
40
mg
simvastatin
daily
reduced
the
rate
of
ischaemic
strokes
by
about
one-quarter
and
so
after
making
allowance
for
non-compliance
in
the
trial
actual
use
of
this
regimen
would
probably
reduce
the
stroke
rate
by
about
a
third
HPS
also
provides
definitive
evidence
that
statin
therapy
is
beneficial
for
people
with
pre-existing
cerebrovascular
disease
even
if
they
do
not
already
have
manifest
coronary
disease
