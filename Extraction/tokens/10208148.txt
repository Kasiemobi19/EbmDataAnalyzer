Title
Pharmacological
treatment
of
alcohol
dependence
a
review
of
the
evidence
Abstract
Text
Alcoholism
affects
approximately
10%
of
Americans
at
some
time
in
their
lives
Treatment
consists
of
psychosocial
interventions
pharmacological
interventions
or
both
but
which
drugs
are
most
effective
at
enhancing
abstinence
and
preventing
relapse
has
not
been
systematically
reviewed
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
5
categories
of
drugs
used
to
treat
alcohol
dependence--disulfiram
the
opioid
antagonists
naltrexone
and
nalmefene
acamprosate
various
serotonergic
agents
(including
selective
serotonergic
reuptake
inhibitors)
and
lithium
Reports
of
randomized
controlled
trials
nonrandomized
trials
and
other
study
designs
in
English
French
and
German
identified
from
multiple
searches
of
MEDLINE
EMBASE
and
specialized
databases
hand
searching
bibliographies
of
review
articles
searches
for
unpublished
literature
and
discussions
with
investigators
in
the
field
We
included
all
studies
on
alcohol-dependent
human
subjects
aged
18
years
or
older
from
all
inpatient
and
outpatient
settings
between
1966
and
December
1997
that
met
our
inclusion
criteria
We
abstracted
the
following
information
study
design
and
blinding
diagnostic
instrument
and
severity
assessment
drug
interventions
and
cointerventions
demographic
and
comorbidity
details
about
patients
compliance
and
numerous
outcome
measures
(eg
relapse
return
to
drinking
drinking
or
nondrinking
days
time
to
first
drink
alcohol
consumed
per
unit
of
time
craving)
We
graded
quality
of
the
individual
articles
(scale
0-100)
independently
from
the
strength
of
evidence
for
each
drug
class
(A
strong
and
consistent
evidence
of
efficacy
in
studies
of
large
size
and/or
high
quality
B
mixed
evidence
of
efficacy
C
evidence
of
lack
of
efficacy
and
I
insufficient
evidence)
Of
375
articles
evaluated
we
abstracted
and
analyzed
data
from
41
studies
and
11
follow-up
or
subgroup
studies
Naltrexone
(grade
A)
reduces
the
risk
of
relapse
to
heavy
drinking
and
the
frequency
of
drinking
compared
with
placebo
but
does
not
substantially
enhance
abstinence
ie
avoidance
of
any
alcohol
consumption
Acamprosate
(grade
A
from
large-scale
studies
in
Europe)
reduces
drinking
frequency
although
its
effects
on
enhancing
abstinence
or
reducing
time
to
first
drink
are
less
clear
Controlled
studies
of
disulfiram
(grade
B)
reveal
a
mixed
outcome
pattern--some
evidence
that
drinking
frequency
is
reduced
but
minimal
evidence
to
support
improved
continuous
abstinence
rates
The
limited
data
on
serotonergic
agents
were
not
very
promising
(grade
I)
although
most
studies
were
confounded
by
high
rates
of
comorbid
mood
disorders
Lithium
lacks
efficacy
(grade
C)
in
the
treatment
of
primary
alcohol
dependence
Recent
reports
documenting
that
naltrexone
and
acamprosate
are
more
effective
than
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
alcoholism
justify
clinical
interest
in
use
of
these
medications
for
alcohol-dependent
patients
Use
of
disulfiram
is
widespread
but
less
clearly
supported
by
the
clinical
trial
evidence
however
targeted
studies
on
supervised
administration
of
disulfiram
may
be
warranted
Use
of
existing
serotonergic
agents
or
lithium
for
patients
with
primary
alcohol
dependence
does
not
appear
to
be
supported
by
the
efficacy
data
available
at
this
time
these
medications
may
still
have
a
positive
effect
in
patients
with
coexisting
psychiatric
disorders
