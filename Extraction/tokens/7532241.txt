Abstract
Text
To
develop
a
set
of
minimum
clinical
guidelines
for
use
by
primary
care
physicians
in
the
evaluation
and
management
of
patients
with
hyperthyroidism
and
hypothyroidism
Guidelines
were
developed
by
a
nine-member
ad
hoc
Standards
of
Care
Committee
of
the
American
Thyroid
Association
(the
authors
of
this
article)
The
participants
were
selected
by
the
committee
chair
and
the
president
of
the
American
Thyroid
Association
on
the
basis
of
their
clinical
experience
The
committee
members
represented
different
geographic
areas
within
the
United
States
in
order
to
take
into
account
different
practice
styles
Guidelines
were
developed
on
the
basis
of
expert
opinion
of
the
participants
as
well
as
on
available
published
information
Input
was
obtained
from
all
of
the
participants
each
of
whom
wrote
an
initial
section
of
the
document
A
complete
draft
document
was
then
written
by
three
participants
(PAS
DSC
and
EGL)
and
resubmitted
to
the
entire
committee
for
revision
The
revised
document
was
then
submitted
to
the
entire
membership
of
the
American
Thyroid
Association
for
written
comments
which
were
then
reviewed
(mainly
by
PAS
DSC
and
EGL)
Many
of
the
suggestions
of
the
American
Thyroid
Association
members
were
incorporated
into
the
final
draft
which
was
then
approved
by
the
Executive
Council
of
the
American
Thyroid
Association
The
entire
process
from
initial
drafts
to
final
approval
took
approximately
18
months
A
set
of
minimum
clinical
guidelines
for
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
hyperthyroidism
and
hypothyroidism
were
developed
by
consensus
of
a
group
of
experienced
thyroidologists
The
guidelines
are
intended
to
be
used
by
physicians
in
their
care
of
patients
with
thyroid
disorders
with
the
expectation
that
more
effective
care
can
be
provided
and
at
a
cost
savings
