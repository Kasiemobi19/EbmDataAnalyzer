Title
Laxatives
for
the
treatment
of
hemorrhoids
Abstract
Text
Symptomatic
hemorrhoids
are
a
common
medical
condition
which
increase
in
prevalence
in
women
during
pregnancy
and
postpartum
Although
the
evidence
appears
to
be
inconclusive
narrative
reviews
and
clinical
practice
guidelines
recommend
the
use
of
laxatives
(and
fiber)
for
the
treatment
of
hemorrhoids
and
relief
of
symptoms
This
is
due
to
their
safety
and
low
cost
To
evaluate
the
impact
of
laxatives
on
a
wide
range
of
symptoms
in
people
with
symptomatic
hemorrhoids
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
2
2005)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
2005)
EMBASE
(1980
to
2005)
CINAHL
(1982
to
2005)
BIOSIS
and
AMED
(Allied
and
Alternative
Medicine
Database)
for
eligible
trials
(including
conference
proceedings)
We
sought
missing
and
additional
information
from
authors
industry
and
experts
in
the
field
We
selected
all
published
and
unpublished
randomised
controlled
trials
that
compared
any
type
of
laxative
to
placebo
or
no
therapy
in
any
patient
population
Two
authors
independently
screened
studies
for
inclusion
and
retrieved
all
potentially
relevant
studies
Data
were
extracted
from
studies
that
met
our
selection
criteria
on
study
population
intervention
used
pre-specified
outcomes
and
methodology
We
extracted
methodological
information
for
the
assessment
of
internal
validity
existence
and
method
of
generation
of
the
randomization
schedule
and

of

and

measures
Seven
randomised
trials
enrolling
a
total
of
378
participants
to
fiber
or
a
non-fiber
control
were
identified
Meta-analyses
using
random-effects
models
showed
that
laxatives
in
the
form
of
fiber
had
a
beneficial
effect
in
the
treatment
of
symptomatic
hemorrhoids
The
risk
of
not
improving
hemorrhoids
and
having
persisting
symptoms
decreased
by
53%
in
the
fiber
group
(risk
reduction
(RR)
047
95%
CI
032
to
068)
These
results
are
compatible
with
large
treatment
effects
regarding
prolapse
pain
itching
although
the
pooled
analyses
showed
a
tendency
toward
no-effect
for
these
parametres
The
effect
on
bleeding
showed
a
significant
difference
in
favour
of
the
fiber
(RR
050
95%
CI
028
to
089)
Studies
including
data
on
multiple
follow
ups
(usually
after
six
weeks
and
three
months)
showed
consistent
results
over
time
However
we
have
to
stress
two
possible
limitations
of
this
review
the
risk
of
publication
bias
and
only
moderate
study
quality
The
use
of
fiber
shows
a
consistent
beneficial
effect
for
relieving
overall
symptoms
and
bleeding
in
the
treatment
of
symptomatic
hemorrhoids
