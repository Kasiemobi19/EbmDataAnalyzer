Abstract
Text
The
Scandinavian
Simvastatin
Survival
Study
(4S)
and
other
randomized
clinical
trials
have
demonstrated
that
cholesterol-lowering
treatment
with
statins
improves
prognosis
in
patients
with
coronary
atherosclerosis
compared
with
placebo
The
effect
of
therapy
with
statins
beyond
the
typical
5
to
6
years'
duration
of
the
trials
in
particular
regarding
the
risk
of
cancer
has
not
been
investigated
This
study
examines
the
long-term
effects
of
simvastatin
for
up
to
8
years
on
cause-specific
mortality
in
patients
with
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
We
performed
an
observational
government
registry-based
study
of
mortality
in
the
groups
originally
randomized
to
simvastatin
or
placebo
in
the
4S
over
an
additional
2-year
follow-up
period
so
that
the
median
total
follow-up
period
was
74
years
(range
69
to
83
in
surviving
patients)
Randomization
took
place
at
outpatient
clinics
at
94
clinical
centers
in
Denmark
Finland
Iceland
Norway
and
Sweden
from
1988
to
1989
Of
4444
patients
with
CHD
2223
and
2221
were
randomized
to
treatment
with
placebo
or
simvastatin
therapy
respectively
Patients
received
treatment
with
simvastatin
starting
at
20
mg/day
with
titration
to
40
mg/day
at
12
or
24
weeks
if
total
cholesterol
was
>52
mmol/L
(200
mg/dl)
or
placebo
After
the
double-blind
period
most
patients
in
both
treatment
groups
received
simvastatin
as
open-label
prescription
Of
the
1967
patients
originally
treated
with
placebo
and
surviving
the
double-blind
period
97
(49%)
died
during
the
following
2
years
In
the
group
randomized
to
simvastatin
the
corresponding
number
was
74
of
the
2
039
survivors
(36%)
Adding
these
deaths
to
those
occurring
during
the
original
trial
the
total
was
353
(159%)
and
256
(115%)
deaths
in
the
groups
originally
randomized
to
placebo
and
simvastatin
respectively
The
relative
risk
was
070
(95%
confidence
interval
0
60
to
082
p
=
000002)
The
total
number
of
cancer
deaths
was
68
(31%)
in
the
placebo
group
and
52
(23%)
in
the
simvastatin
group
(relative
risk
073
95%
confidence
interval
051
to
005
p
=
0
087)
and
the
numbers
of
noncardiovascular
and
other
deaths
were
similar
in
both
groups
We
therefore
conclude
that
treatment
with
simvastatin
for
up
to
8
years
in
patients
with
CHD
is
safe
and
yields
continued
survival
benefit
