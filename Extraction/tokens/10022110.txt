Sexual
dysfunction
in
the
United
States
prevalence
and
predictors
Abstract
Text
While
recent
pharmacological
advances
have
generated
increased
public
interest
and
demand
for
clinical
services
regarding
erectile
dysfunction
epidemiologic
data
on
sexual
dysfunction
are
relatively
scant
for
both
women
and
men
To
assess
the
prevalence
and
risk
of
experiencing
sexual
dysfunction
across
various
social
groups
and
examine
the
determinants
and
health
consequences
of
these
disorders
Analysis
of
data
from
the
National
Health
and
Social
Life
Survey
a
probability
sample
study
of
sexual
behavior
in
a
demographically
representative
1992
cohort
of
US
adults
A
national
probability
sample
of
1749
women
and
1410
men
aged
18
to
59
years
at
the
time
of
the
survey
Risk
of
experiencing
sexual
dysfunction
as
well
as
negative
concomitant
outcomes
Sexual
dysfunction
is
more
prevalent
for
women
(43%)
than
men
(31%)
and
is
associated
with
various
demographic
characteristics
including
age
and
educational
attainment
Women
of
different
racial
groups
demonstrate
different
patterns
of
sexual
dysfunction
Differences
among
men
are
not
as
marked
but
generally
consistent
with
women
Experience
of
sexual
dysfunction
is
more
likely
among
women
and
men
with
poor
physical
and
emotional
health
Moreover
sexual
dysfunction
is
highly
associated
with
negative
experiences
in
sexual
relationships
and
overall
well-being
The
results
indicate
that
sexual
dysfunction
is
an
important
public
health
concern
and
emotional
problems
likely
contribute
to
the
experience
of
these
problems
