Blood
pressure
control
and
nephroprotection
in
diabetes
Abstract
Text
Achievement
of
recommended
levels
of
blood
pressure
as
prescribed
by
guidelines
(ie
systolic
blood
pressure
of
<
130
mmHg
in
people
with
nephropathy
secondary
to
type
2
diabetes)
generally
requires
three
or
more
different
antihypertensive
agents
that
have
complementary
modes
of
action
This
systolic
goal
blood
pressure
recommended
by
generally
all
international
guideline
committees
was
derived
from
largely
observational
studies
demonstrating
a
greater
reduction
of
cardiovascular
risk
and
preservation
of
kidney
function
at
these
levels
Commonly
used
antihypertensive
combinations
include
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
or
angiotensin
receptor
blockers
which
have
compelling
indications
for
use
in
people
with
kidney
disease
and/or
diabetes
combined
with
a
diuretic
generally
a
thiazide-type
agent
If
additional
therapy
is
required
either
a
beta-blocker
or
a
calcium
antagonist
may
be
added
to
this
antihypertensive
"cocktail"
Beta-blockers
are
particularly
effective
in
people
with
a
high
sympathetic
drive
(ie
high
pulse
rates)
to
lower
blood
pressure
and
reduce
cardiovascular
risk
Moreover
in
recent
studies
their
benefits
on
kidney
function
both
by
reducing
macroalbuminuria
and
slowing
the
decline
of
kidney
function
make
them
good
agents
to
add
in
the
appropriate
clinical
setting
With
all
these
potential
benefits
of
achieving
blood
pressure
goals
it
is
unfortunate
that
only
11%
of
people
being
treated
for
hypertension
with
diabetic
kidney
disease
achieve
the
blood
pressure
goal
of
<
130
mmHg
likely
contributing
to
the
climbing
incidence
of
people
starting
dialysis
Physicians
need
to
work
harder
and
educate
patients
on
the
importance
of
achieving
these
lower
blood
pressure
guidelines
