Abstract
Text
This
retrospective
study
compares
two
methods
used
to
treat
de
Quervain's
disease
splintage
with
oral
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
and
steroid
injection
Patients
were
separated
into
three
groups
based
on
symptom
severity
group
I-minimal
group
II-mild
and
group
III-moderate
or
severe
Three
hundred
and
nineteen
wrists
in
300
patients
were
followed
from
one
to
six
years
Fifteen
of
17
patients
with
minimal
symptoms
were
relieved
with
splintage
and
NSAIDs
However
only
seven
of
20
in
Group
II
and
two
of
eight
in
Group
III
treated
similarly
were
relieved
Of
the
249
patients
in
Group
III
treated
with
injections
76%
were
completely
relieved
7%
were
improved
and
4%
were
not
improved
We
conclude
that
classification
of
patients'
with
de
Quervain's
disease
based
on
their
pre-treatment
symptoms
may
assist
surgeons
in
selecting
the
most
efficacious
treatment
and
in
providing
prognostic
information
to
their
patients
