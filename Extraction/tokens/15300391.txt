Magnetic
resonance
imaging
and
ultrasound
evaluation
of
penile
and
testicular
masses
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
present
the
role
of
ultrasonography
and
MRI
in
the
investigation
of
testicular
and
penile
masses
as
well
as
to
review
the
literature
This
article
is
based
on
our
experience
with
230
patients
who
presented
with
acute
or
subacute
scrotal
pain
or
painless
enlargement
of
the
scrotum
or
penis
Gray
scale
and
color
Doppler
ultrasonography
(CDU)
were
applied
in
all
cases
In
73
cases
the
final
diagnosis
was
established
by
surgery
and
in
157
cases
by
follow-up
MRI
was
performed
in
48
cases
Ultrasonography
was
the
initial
imaging
modality
in
all
cases
It
provided
detailed
anatomic
information
with
high
sensitivity
and
accuracy
in
cases
of
torsion
inflammation
varicocele
and
trauma
In
cases
of
tumor
US
showed
the
presence
of
the
mass
in
all
cases
while
it
additionally
revealed
certain
characteristic
features
of
tissue
constitution
and
blood
supply
In
most
cases
differentiation
between
various
types
of
tumors
or
differentiation
between
malignant
and
benign
lesions
was
impossible
MRI
besides
the
detailed
anatomic
imaging
also
provided
a
certain
degree
of
tissue
specificity
MRI
could
help
in
the
detection
and
staging
of
penile
cancer
and
in
the
evaluation
of
testicular
and
scrotal
masses
especially
when
a
diagnostic
dilemma
occurred
on
ultrasonographic
examination
Ultrasonography
combining
gray
scale
and
color
techniques
is
irreplaceable
in
the
diagnostic
work-up
of
scrotal
and
penile
masses
while
MRI
can
serve
as
a
problem
solving
diagnostic
modality
