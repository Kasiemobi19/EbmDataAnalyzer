Abstract
Text
Human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)-infected
persons
are
less
likely
than
are
noninfected
persons
to
respond
to
vaccination
with
pneumococcal
polysaccharides
(PPS)
Among
those
who
respond
however
similar
IgG
levels
may
be
achieved
HIV-infected
men
immunized
with
pneumococcal
vaccine
were
classified
as
high-
or
low-level
responders
(IgG

microgram/mL
for

or

3
of
5
PPS
[high]
or
for
<
or

PPS
[low])
One
and
2
years
after
immunization
geometric
mean
IgG
levels
and
the
percentages
of
subjects
with
IgG
levels
>
or
=
1
microgram/mL
were
similar
for
HIV-infected
and
for
healthy
high-level
responders
(controls)
for
all
PPS
except
for
serotype

Among
HIV-infected
low-level
responders
revaccination
with
a
double
dose
of
pneumococcal
vaccine
did
not
stimulate
IgG
responses
Responsiveness
of
HIV-infected
white
patients
was
significantly
associated
with
the
Km(1)-
negative
allotype
These
findings
support
current
general
recommended
guidelines
for
administering
pneumococcal
vaccine
to
HIV-infected
persons
Nonresponders
will
not
benefit
from
revaccination
