Title
Meta-analysis
of
tympanostomy
tube
sequelae
Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
incidence
of
tympanostomy
tube
sequelae
based
on
systematic
review
of
published
case
series
and
randomized
studies
English-language
MEDLINE
search
from
1966
through
April
1999
with
manual
reference
search
of
proceedings
articles
reports
and
guidelines
Cohort
studies
with
otitis
media
as
the
primary
indication
for
tube
placement
Two
reviewers
independently
extracted
data
from
134
articles
Transient
otorrhea
occurred
in
16%
of
patients
in
the
postoperative
period
and
later
in
26%
recurrent
otorrhea
occurred
in
74%
of
patients
and
chronic
otorrhea
in
38%
Sequelae
of
indwelling
tubes
included
obstruction
(7%
of
ears)
granulation
tissue
(5%)
premature
extrusion
(39%)
and
medial
displacement
(05%)
Sequelae
after
tube
extrusion
included
tympanosclerosis
(32%)
focal
atrophy
(25%)
retraction
pocket
(31%)
cholesteatoma
(07%)
and
perforation
(22%
with
short-term
tubes
166%
with
long-term
tubes)
Meta-analysis
showed
that
long-term
tubes
increased
the
relative
risk
of
perforation
by
35
(95%
CI
15
to
71)
and
cholesteatoma
by
26
(95%
CI
15
to
44)
Similarly
intubation
increased
the
relative
risk
of
tympanosclerosis
by
35
(95%
CI
26
to
49)
and
focal
atrophy
by
17
(95%
CI
11
to
27)
over
nonintubated
control
ears
(baseline
tympanosclerosis
and
atrophy
rates
of
10%
and
14%
respectively)
Sequelae
of
tympanostomy
tubes
are
common
but
are
generally
transient
(otorrhea)
or
cosmetic
(tympanosclerosis
focal
atrophy)
Nonetheless
the
high
incidence
suggests
a
need
for
ongoing
otologic
surveillance
of
all
patients
with
indwelling
tubes
and
for
a
reasonable
time
period
after
tube
extrusion
Long-term
tubes
should
be
used
on
a
selective
and
individualized
basis
