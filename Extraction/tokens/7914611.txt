Abstract
Text
In
severe
heart
failure
many
deaths
are
sudden
and
are
presumed
to
be
due
to
ventricular
arrhythmias
The
GESICA
trial
evaluated
the
effect
of
low-dose
amiodarone
on
two-year
mortality
in
patients
with
severe
heart
failure
Our
prospective
multicentre
trial
included
516
patients
on
optimal
standard
treatment
for
heart
failure
Patients
were
randomised
to
300
mg/day
amiodarone
(260)
or
to
standard
treatment
(256)
Intention-to-treat
analysis
showed
87
deaths
in
the
amiodarone
group
(335%)
compared
with
106
in
the
control
group
(414%)
(risk

There
were
reductions
in
both

(risk

and
death
due
to
progressive
heart
failure
(risk

Fewer
patients
in
the
amiodarone
group
died
or
were
admitted
to
hospital
due
to
worsening
heart
failure
(119
versus
149

the
control
group

The
decrease
in
mortality
and
hospital
admission
was
present
in
all
subgroups
examined
and
independent
of
the
presence
of
non-sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
Side-effects
were
reported
in
17
patients
(61%)
amiodarone
was
withdrawn
in
12
Low-dose
amiodarone
proved
to
be
an
effective
and
reliable
treatment
reducing
mortality
and
hospital
admission
in
patients
with
severe
heart
failure
independently
of
the
presence
of
complex
ventricular
arrhythmias
