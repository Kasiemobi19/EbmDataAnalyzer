Constipation
in
childhood
a
controlled
comparison
between
lactulose
and
standardized
senna
Abstract
Text
Twenty-one
children
under
15-years'
old
with
chronic
constipation
were
treated
in
a
crossover
trial
lasting
3
weeks
In
the
first
week
they
received
either
lactulose
or
senna
in
the
next
week
no
treatment
and
in
the
third
week
the
alternative
treatment
Patient
diaries
were
kept
by
parents
on
the
number
and
character
of
stools
passed
and
of
side-effects
reported
during
the
3
weeks
There
was
a
significant
difference
in
favour
of
lactulose
in
the
number
of
days
on
which
normal
stools
were
passed
during
the
treatment
weeks
The
number
and
frequency
of
the
side-effects
reported
in
the
senna
treatment
week
were
very
much
higher
(p
less
than
0001)
than
in
the
lactulose
week
Lactulose
is
recommended
as
an
effective
and
very
well
tolerated
treatment
for
the
constipated
child
