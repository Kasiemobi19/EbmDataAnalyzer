Title
Antibiotics
for
sore
throat
Abstract
Text
Sore
throat
is
a
very
common
reason
for
people
to
present
for
medical
care
Although
it
remits
spontaneously
primary
care
doctors
commonly
prescribe
antibiotics
for
it
To
assess
the
benefits
of
antibiotics
for
sore
throat
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
and
the
Database
of
Abstracts
of
Reviews
of
Effects
(DARE)
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
1
2006)
MEDLINE
(January
1966
to
March
2006)
and
EMBASE
(January
1990
to
December
2005)
Trials
of
antibiotic
against
control
with
either
measures
of
the
typical
symptoms
(throat
soreness
headache
or
fever)
or
suppurative
or
non-suppurative
complications
of
sore
throat
Potential
studies
were
screened
independently
by
two
authors
for
inclusion
with
differences
in
opinion
resolved
by
discussion
Data
were
then
independently
extracted
from
studies
selected
by
inclusion
by
two
authors
Researchers
from
three
studies
were
contacted
for
additional
information
There
were
27
studies
with
2835
cases
of
sore
throat

Non-suppurative
complications
There
was
a
trend
for
antibiotics
to
protect
against
acute
glomerulonephritis
but
there
were
insufficient
cases
to
be
sure
Several
studies
found
antibiotics
reduced
acute
rheumatic
fever
by
more
than
two
thirds
(relative
risk
(RR)
022
95%
CI
002
to
208)

Suppurative
complications
Antibiotics
reduced
the
incidence
of
acute
otitis
media
(RR
030
95%
CI
015
to
058)
of
acute
sinusitis
(RR
048
95%
CI
008
to
276)
and
of
quinsy
(peritonsillar
abscess)
compared
to
those
taking
placebo
(RR
015
95%
CI
005
to
047)

Throat
soreness
and
fever
were
reduced
by
antibiotics
by
about
one
half
The
greatest
difference
was
seen
at
about
3
to
4
days
(when
the
symptoms
of
about
50%
of
untreated
patients
had
settled)
By
one
week
about
90%
of
treated
and
untreated
patients
were
symptom-free
The
overall
number
need
to
treat
to
prevent
one
sore
throat
at
day
3
was
just
under
six
(95%
CI
49
to
70)
at
week
1
it
was
21
(95%
CI
132
to
479)

Subgroup
analyses
of
symptom
reduction
Analysis
by
age
blind
versus
unblinded
or
use
of
antipyretics
found
no
significant
differences
Analysis
of
results
of
throat
swabs
showed
that
antibiotics
were
more
effective
against
symptoms
at
day
3
RR
058
(95%
CI
048
to
071)
if
the
swabs
were
positive
for
Streptococcus
compared
to
RR
078
(95%
CI
063
to
097)
if
negative
Similarly
at
week

RRs
029
(95%

to

for

to

for
negative
swabs
Antibiotics
confer
relative
benefits
in
the
treatment
of
sore
throat
However
the
absolute
benefits
are
modest
Protecting
sore
throat
sufferers
against
suppurative
and
non-suppurative
complications
in
modern
Western
society
can
only
be
achieved
by
treating
many
with
antibiotics
most
of
whom
will
derive
no
benefit
In
emerging
economies
(where
rates
of
acute
rheumatic
fever
are
high
for
example)
the
number
needed
to
treat
may
be
much
lower
for
antibiotics
to
be
considered
effective
Antibiotics
shorten
the
duration
of
symptoms
by
about
sixteen
hours
overall
