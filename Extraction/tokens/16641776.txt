Abstract
Text
Cochrane
systematic
review
To
assess
the
effects
of
superficial
heat
and
cold
therapy
for
low
back
pain
in
adults
Heat
and
cold
are
commonly
used
in
the
treatment
of
low
back
pain
We
searched
electronic
databases
from
inception
to
October
2005
Two
authors
independently
assessed
inclusion
methodologic
quality
and
extracted
data
using
the
criteria
recommended
by
the
Cochrane
Back
Review
Group
Nine
trials
involving
1117
participants
were
included
In
two
trials
of
258
participants
with
a
mix
of
acute
and
subacute
low
back
pain
heat
wrap
therapy
significantly
reduced
pain
after
5
days
(weighted
mean
difference
[WMD]
106
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
068-145
scale
range
0-5)
compared
with
oral
placebo
One
trial
of
90
participants
with
acute
low
back
pain
found
that
a
heated
blanket
significantly
decreased
pain
immediately
after
application
(WMD
-3220
95%
CI
-3869
to
-2571
scale
range
0-100)
One
trial
of
100
participants
with
a
mix
of
acute
and
subacute
low
back
pain
examined
the
additional
effects
of
adding
exercise
to
heat
wrap
and
found
that
it
reduced
pain
after
7
days
The
evidence
base
to
support
the
common
practice
of
superficial
heat
and
cold
for
low
back
pain
is
limited
and
there
is
a
need
for
future
higher-quality
randomized
controlled
trials
There
is
moderate
evidence
in
a
small
number
of
trials
that
heat
wrap
therapy
provides
a
small
short-term
reduction
in
pain
and
disability
in
a
population
with
a
mix
of
acute
and
subacute
low
back
pain
and
that
the
addition
of
exercise
further
reduces
pain
and
improves
function
There
is
insufficient
evidence
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
cold
for
low
back
pain
and
conflicting
evidence
for
any
differences
between
heat
and
cold
for
low
back
pain
