Immune
responses
of
splenectomized
trauma
patients
to
the
23-valent
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
at
1
versus
7
versus
14
days
after
splenectomy
Abstract
Text
Pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
is
given
after
emergency
splenectomy
for
trauma
to
lessen
the
risk
of
overwhelming
postsplenectomy
sepsis
This
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
optimal
timing
of
vaccine
administration
as
determined
by
serum
type-specific
polysaccharide
antibody
concentration
titer
and
functional
activity
of
the
resulting
antibodies
Fifty-nine
consecutive
patients
undergoing
splenectomy
after
trauma
were
randomized
to
receive
pneumococcal
vaccine
postoperatively
at
1
7
or
14
days
Immunoglobulin
G
serum
antibody
concentrations
against
serogroup
4
and
serotypes
6B
19F
and
23F
were
measured
before
vaccination
and
4
weeks
postvaccination
Antibody
concentrations
were
determined
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
and
functional
antibody
by
opsonophagocytosis
Results
were
compared
with
a
normal
adult
control
group
(n
=
12)
Postvaccination
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
immunoglobulin
G
antibody
concentrations
for
all
serogroups
and
serotypes
studied
were
not
significantly
different
in
splenectomized
patients
and
control
subjects
Postvaccination
functional
antibody
activity
was
significantly
reduced
in
early
vaccination
groups
(serotype
6B
excepted)
However
with
the
exception
of
19F
all
titers
for
the
14-day
group
approached
those
of
the
control
subjects
(p
>
005)
Fold-increases
of
opsonophagocytic
titers
for
serogroup
4
and
serotypes
6B
and
19F
showed
progressive
increases
with
delay
in
vaccination
Except
for
serotype
23F
the
number
of
postsplenectomy
patients
with
opsonophagocytic
titers
<64
significantly
decreased
with
a
delay
in
vaccination
(14
days)
Postvaccination
immunoglobulin
G
serum
antibody
concentrations
were
not
significantly
different
from
normal
control
subjects
regardless
of
the
time
of
vaccination
(1
7
or
14
days)
Although
concentrations
approach
normal
functional
antibody
activity
was
significantly
lower
Better
functional
antibody
responses
against
the
serogroup
and
serotypes
studied
seemed
to
occur
with
delayed
(14-day)
vaccination
