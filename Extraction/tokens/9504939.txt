Abstract
Text
Critically
ill
patients
who
require
mechanical
ventilation
are
at
increased
risk
for
gastrointestinal
bleeding
from
stress
ulcers
There
are
conflicting
data
on
the
effect
of
histamine
H2-receptor
antagonists
and
the
cytoprotective
agent
sucralfate
on
rates
of
gastrointestinal
bleeding
ventilator-associated
pneumonia
and
mortality
In
a
multicenter
randomized
blinded
placebo-controlled
trial
we
compared
sucralfate
with
the
H2-receptor
antagonist
ranitidine
for
the
prevention
of
upper
gastrointestinal
bleeding
in
1200
patients
who
required
mechanical
ventilation
Patients
received
either
nasogastric
sucralfate
suspension
(1
g
every
six
hours)
and
an
intravenous
placebo
or
intravenous
ranitidine
(50
mg
every
eight
hours)
and
a
nasogastric
placebo
The
patients
in
the
two
groups
had
similar
base-line
characteristics
Clinically
important
gastrointestinal
bleeding
developed
in
10
of
596
(17
percent)
of
the
patients
receiving
ranitidine
as
compared
with
23
of
604
(38
percent)
of
those
receiving
sucralfate
(relative
risk
044
95
percent
confidence
interval
021
to
092
P=002)
In
the
ranitidine
group
114
of
596
patients
(191
percent)
had
ventilator-associated
pneumonia
as
compared
with
98
of
604
(162
percent)
in
the
sucralfate
group
(relative
risk
118
95
percent
confidence
interval
092
to
151
P=019)
There
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
groups
in
mortality
in
the
intensive
care
unit
(ICU)
(235
percent
in
the
ranitidine
group
and
229
percent
in
the
sucralfate
group)
or
the
duration
of
the
stay
in
the
ICU
(median
nine
days
in
both
groups)
Among
critically
ill
patients
requiring
mechanical
ventilation
those
receiving
ranitidine
had
a
significantly
lower
rate
of
clinically
important
gastrointestinal
bleeding
than
those
treated
with
sucralfate
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
rates
of
ventilator-associated
pneumonia
the
duration
of
the
stay
in
the
ICU
or
mortality
