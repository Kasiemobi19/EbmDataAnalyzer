Text
This
study
was
undertaken
to
examine
the
trends
in
the
diagnosis
of
Type
2
diabetes
mellitus
among
children
and
adolescents
with
new-onset
diabetes
seen
from
1994
through
1998
at
the
three
university-based
diabetes
centers
in
Florida
Data
were
abstracted
from
medical
records
and
patients
were
categorized
as
having
Type
1
or
Type
2
diabetes
There
were
569
patients
classified
with
Type
1
diabetes
and
92
with
Type
2
diabetes
The
proportion
of
patients
diagnosed
with
Type
2
diabetes
increased
over
the
five
years
from
94%
in
1994
to
200%
in
1998
(chi-square
test

There
was
not
an
associated
net
increase
in
the
total
number
of
new
diabetes
patients
referred
over
time
(chi-square
test
for
trend
=
06
p=04)
Those
with
Type
2
diabetes
were
more
likely
to
have
a
body
mass
index
in
the
85th-94th
percentile

compared
with
those

From
1994
through
1998
there
was
a
significant
overall
increase
in
the
percentage
of
children
referred
with
new-onset
diabetes
who
were
considered
to
have
Type

diabetes
Factors
associated
with
the
diagnosis
of
Type

diabetes
relative
to
Type

diabetes
