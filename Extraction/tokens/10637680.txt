children

quantitative

of
the
efficacy

different
management
strategies
Abstract
Text
To
obtain
estimates
of
the
relative
efficacy
of
3
main
treatment
strategies
for
attention-deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
in
children
and
youth
(age
<
18
years)
Design
quantitative
systematic
review
of
randomized
trials
Subjects
999
patients
with
ADHD
from
26
randomized
trials
Interventions
medications
alone
behavioural
interventions
alone
and
a
combination
of
these
2
modalities
Main
outcome
measure
differences
in
scores
between
treatment
groups
on
commonly
used
teacher-
and
parent-completed
behaviour
rating
scales
Medication-only
therapy
was
efficacious
in
ADHD
Behavioural
therapies
used
alone
appeared
not
to
be
efficacious
in
ADHD
Combination
therapy
was
more
efficacious
than
placebo
or
no
treatment
for
parent
but
not
teacher
ratings
not
more
efficacious
than
drug
therapy
alone
and
more
efficacious
than
behavioural
treatments
alone
based
on
parent
but
not
teacher
ratings
Though
stimulant
medications
were
found
to
be
an
effective
treatment
strategy
for
ADHD
in
children
and
youth
it
proved
difficult
to
assess
the
relative
benefits
of
behavioural
interventions
alone
and
combined
medication
and
behavioural
therapy
because
of
the
paucity
of
treatment
studies
other
than
medication-only
treatment
studies
and
heterogeneity
of
various
kinds
that
exist
in
relation
to
ADHD
studies
and
treatments
