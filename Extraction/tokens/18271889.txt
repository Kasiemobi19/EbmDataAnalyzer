Title
Crocus
sativus
L
(saffron)
in
the
treatment
of
premenstrual
syndrome
a
double-blind
randomised
and
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
this
double-blind
and
placebo-controlled
trial
was
to
investigate
whether
saffron
(stigma
of
Crocus
sativus
L)
could
relieve
symptoms
of
premenstrual
syndrome
(PMS)
Double-blind
randomised
and
placebo-controlled
trial
Departments

University

Sciences
Women
aged
20-45
years
with
regular
menstrual
cycles
and
experience
of
PMS
symptoms
for
at
least
6
months
were
eligible
for
the
study
Women
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
capsule
saffron
30
mg/day
(15
mg
twice
a
day
morning
and
evening)
(group
A)
or
capsule
placebo
(twice
a
day)
for
a
two
menstrual
cycles
(cycles
3
and
4)
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
the
Daily
Symptom
Report
and
secondary
outcome
measure
was
the
Hamilton
Depression
Rating
Scale
In
this
trial
saffron
was
found
to
be
effective
in
relieving
symptoms
of
PMS
A
significant
difference
was
observed
in
efficacy
of
saffron
in
cycles
3
and
4
in
the
Total
Premenstrual
Daily
Symptoms
and
Hamilton
Depression
Rating
Scale
The
results
of
this
study
indicate
the
efficacy
of
C
sativus
L
in
the
treatment
of
PMS
However
a
tolerable
adverse
effects
profile
of
saffron
may
well
confirm
the
application
of
saffron
as
an
alternative
treatment
for
PMS
These
results
deserved
further
investigations
