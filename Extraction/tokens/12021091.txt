Insulin
intervention
to

beta

in
slowly

insulin-dependent
(type

diabetes
mellitus
Abstract
Text
Slowly
progressive
insulin-dependent
(type
1)
diabetes
mellitus
(SPIDDM)
is
characterized
by
(1)
late
age
of
onset
with
initial
features
of
NIDDM
and
subsequent
progression
to
insulin-dependent
stage
(2)
high
predictive
value
of
autoantibodies
against
glutamic
acid
decarboxylase
(GADAb)
and
islet
cell
antibodies
(ICA)
for
progression
of
beta
cell
failure
(3)
less
predominant
T
cell
response
which
may
attack
and
eventually
destroy
beta-cells
in
affected
pancreas
These
findings
may
suggest
a
rationale
for
intervention
to
prevent
slowly
progressive
beta
cell
dysfunction
in
this
type
of
diabetes
We
identified
three
independent
risk
factors
for
progression
of
beta
cell
failure
in
SPIDDM
(1)
sulfonylurea
treatment
(2)
ICA-positive
periods
and
(3)
initial
body
weight
We
hypothesized
that
removal
of
the
risk
factors
for
further
progression
of
beta
cell
dysfunction
will
have
beneficial
effects
on
intervention
strategy
in
treating
SPIDDM
In
our
pilot
study
we
used
a
small
dose
of
insulin
instead
of
sulfonylurea
in
the
early
stage
of
treatment
of
patients
with
SPIDDM
Insulin-treated
SPIDDM
patients
had
a
sustained
C
peptide
response
(CPR)
while
most
of
sulfonylurea-treated
patients
progressed
to
an
insulin-dependent
state
We
organized
a
randomized
multicenter
clinical
trial
to
study
early
treatment
to
prevent
the
progression
of
beta
cell
dysfunction
in
SPIDDM
(the
Tokyo
Study)
It
was
demonstrated
that
early
intervention
with
insulin
therapy
is
an
effective
treatment
modality
in
the
early
stage
of
SPIDDM
patients
who
had
preserved
beta
cell
function
at
entry
(integrated
value
of
serum
C
peptide
values
at
0
30
60
90
and
120
minutes
Sigma
CPR
>or=
10
ng/mL)
and
high
GADAb
(>10
U/mL)
Preventive
insulin
treatment
was
ineffective
in
the
patients
who
had
diminished
insulin
reserve
at
entry
(Sigma
CPR
<
10
ng/mL)
Insulin
intervention
to
preserve
beta
cell
dysfunction
in
SPIDDM
is
effective
and
safe
in
patients
with
preserved
beta
cell
function
and
high
GADAb
titers
at
the
initiation
of
insulin
