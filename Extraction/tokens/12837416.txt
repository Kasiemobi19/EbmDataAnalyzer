infection
in
men

45
years
of
age
is
there
a
need
for
urologic
investigation
Abstract
Text
To
determine
in
a
prospective
study
whether
urinary
tract
infection
(UTI)
in
men
younger
than
45
years
of
age
is
associated
with
anomalies
of
the
genitourinary
tract
that
necessitate
additional
urologic
evaluation
UTI
in
young
men
is
uncommon
In
these
patients
it
is
customary
to
follow
the
same
policy
as
that
for
children
or
older
men
and
to
routinely
perform
urologic
investigations
Twenty-nine
consecutive
otherwise
healthy
male
patients
aged
16
to
45
years
(mean
305)
were
hospitalized
for
a
first
event
of
acute
UTI
All
patients
underwent
an
imaging
evaluation
including
ultrasonography
and
intravenous
urography
Those
with
macroscopic
hematuria
underwent
cystoscopy
Uroflowmetry
was
performed
at
least
1
month
after
recovery
and
patients
with
a
maximal
flow
rate
of
less
than
15
mL/s
underwent
a
pressure
flow
study
Significant
urethral
stricture
was
excluded
in
all
patients
Twenty-seven
patients
(93%)
had
a
postvoid
residual
urine
volume
of
less
than
20
mL
and
only
two
had
values
of
120
and
200
mL
The
imaging
and
cystoscopic
evaluation
demonstrated
a
normal
urinary
tract
in
all
patients
The
maximal
urinary
flow
rate
was
greater
than
15
mL/s
in
22
patients
(76%)
and
lower
than
15
mL/s
in
7
patients
(24%)
In
the
latter
group
urodynamic
investigations
including
free
flowmetry
and/or
pressure
flow
study
revealed
normal
lower
urinary
tract
function
in
6
patients
and
a
bladder
outflow
obstruction
in
1
(3%)
A
first
event
of
UTI
in
men
younger
than
45
years
is
usually
not
associated
with
significant
structural
or
functional
urinary
tract
abnormalities
Therefore
no
radiologic
endoscopic
or
urodynamic
investigation
is
required
