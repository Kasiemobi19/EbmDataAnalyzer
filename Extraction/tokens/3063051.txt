Abstract
Text
This
prospective
study
evaluated
the
significance
of
microbial
analysis
and
antimicrobial
treatment
for
the
cure
of
angular
cheilitis
Furthermore
various
etiologic
factors
were
investigated
for
their
relative
effect
on
the
healing
process
The
study
included
1)
an
open
trial
with
50
patients
infected
by
Candida
albicans
and/or
Staphylococcus
aureus
and
2)
an
intraindividual
comparison
of
eight
patients
with
bilateral
lesions
infected
by
Candida
albicans
as
the
only
detected
pathogen
After
a
base-line
examination
the
patients
received
ointments
containing
nystatin
and/or
fusidic
acid
on
the
basis
of
the
outcome
of
an
initial
microbial
analysis
The
patients
were
evaluated
clinically
photographed
and
examined
for
microorganisms
at
different
time
intervals
Ninety-six
per
cent
of
the
patients
who
participated
in
the
open
trial
had
no
sign
of
infection
after
42
days
of
treatment
Lesions
in
the
double-blind
study
treated
with
nystatin
were
healed
after
28
days
whereas
lesions
that
received
placebo
persisted
throughout
the
treatment
period
Increasing
age
dry
skin
and
extended
skinfolds
at
the
corner
of
the
mouth
were
factors
closely
related
to
the
length
of
the
healing
process
