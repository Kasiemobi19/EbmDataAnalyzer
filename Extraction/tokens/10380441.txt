Abstract
Text
To
document
the
use
of
herbal
preparations
for
cervical
ripening
induction
and
augmentation
of
labor
by
certified
nurse-midwives
(CNMs)
and
nurse-midwifery
education
programs
a
national
survey
of
500
members
of
the
American
College
of
Nurse-Midwives
was
conducted
Forty
eight
nurse-midwifery
education
programs
were
also
surveyed
to
determine
whether
they
were
formally
or
informally
educating
students
in
the
use
of
herbal
preparations
for
cervical
ripening
induction
or
augmentation
of
labor
The
results
of
this
study
a
review
of
the
literature
professional
issues
and
recommendations
for
clinical
practice
are
presented
in
this
article
Of
500
questionnaires
mailed
to
ACNM
members
90
were
returned
from
CNMs
who
used
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
and
82
were
returned
from
CNMs
who
did
not
use
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
Three
questionnaires
were
excluded
due
to
incomplete
data
or
blank
questionnaires
No
significant
differences
were
noted
in
relations
to
geographical
region
midwifery
education
or
highest
level
of
education
between
the
CNM
respondents
who
did
and
those
who
did
not
use
alternative
methods
to
stimulate
labor
Of
the
CNMs
who
used
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
64%
used
blue
cohosh
45%
used
black
cohosh
63%
used
red
raspberry
leaf
93%
used
castor
oil
and
60%
used
evening
primrose
oil
CNMs
who
used
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
were
younger
(43
versus
45
years
P
<
01)
and
more
likely
to
deliver
at
home
or
in
an
in-hospital
or
out-of-hospital
birthing
center
(P
<
0006)
than
CNMs
who
never
used
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
The
most
cited
reason
for
using
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
was
that
they
are
"natural"
whereas
the
most
common
reason
for
not
using
herbal
preparations
was
the
lack
of
research
or
experience
with
the
safety
of
these
substances
Sixty-nine
percent
of
CNMs
who
used
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
learned
about
using
them
from
other
CNMs
4%
from
formal
research
publications
and
none
from
their
formal
education
programs
Although
78%
of
the
CNMs
who
used
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
directly
prescribed
them
and
70%
indirectly
suggested
them
to
clients
only
22%
had
included
them
within
their
written
practice
protocols
Seventy-five
percent
of
the
CNMs
who
used
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
used
them
first
or
instead
of
pitocin
Twenty-one
percent
reported
complications
including
precipitous
labor
tetanic
uterine
contractions
nausea
and
vomiting
Sixty-four
percent
of
the
nurse-midwifery
education
programs
included
instruction
in
the
use
of
herbal
preparations
to
stimulate
labor
in
their
formal
curricula
and
92%
included
informal
discussions
on
the
use
of
herbal
preparations
Evening
primrose
oil
was
the
most
common
herbal
preparation
discussed
in
nurse-midwifery
education
programs
Castor
oil
was
the
most
commonly
used
herbal
preparation
used
by
nurse-midwives
in
clinical
practice
