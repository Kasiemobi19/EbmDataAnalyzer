Abstract
Text
Severity
of
anxiety
does
not
appear
to
influence
the
antidepressant
response
to
fluoxetine
during
acute
treatment
of
major
depressive
disorder
(MDD)
We
report
a
retrospective
pooled
analysis
of
2
studies
to
assess
the
effect
of
associated
anxiety
on
the
efficacy
of
fluoxetine
in
the
continuation
treatment
phase
of
MDD
Patients
whose
MDD
remitted
(study
1)
or
responded
(study
2)
after
approximately
12
to
13
weeks
of
open-label
treatment
with
fluoxetine
20
mg
daily
were
randomly
assigned
in
double-blind
fashion
to
placebo
continued
treatment
with
fluoxetine
20
mg
daily
or
in
study
2
only
treatment
with
enteric-coated
fluoxetine
90
mg
once
weekly
for
at
least
25
weeks
Both
studies
included
male
and
female
outpatients
who
met
criteria
for
MDD
as
assessed
by
DSM-III-R
(study
1)
or
DSM-IV
(study
2)
Patients
were
categorized
into
high
anxiety
(>
or
=
7)
or
low
anxiety
(<
7)
subgroups
based
on
baseline
Hamilton
Rating
Scale
for
Depression
(HAM-D)
anxiety/somatization
subfactor
scores
Subgroups
were
compared
by
therapy
for
time
from
randomization
to
relapse
and
change
in
efficacy
scores
No
significant
differences
in
time
to
relapse
were
observed
between
anxiety
subgroups
in
either
active
treatment
group
However
in
patients
switched
to
placebo
for
continuation
treatment
the
high
anxiety
subgroup
had
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
relapse
than
those
with
low
anxiety
(risk
ratio
=
163
p
=013)
Significant
differences
between
anxiety
groups
were
seen
in
change
in
HAM-D
anxiety/somatization
subfactor
scores
in
the
fluoxetine
20
mg
and
placebo
treatment
groups
and
in
change
in
HAM-D-17
scores
in
the
placebo
treatment
group
(p
<05)
Although
high
baseline
anxiety
does
not
appear
to
impact
the
benefit
of
continuation
therapy
with
fluoxetine
it
does
appear
to
predict
increased
risk
of
relapse
in
individuals
who
do
not
remain
on
antidepressant
therapy
for
the
duration
of
continuation
treatment
