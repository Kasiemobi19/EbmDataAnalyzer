Thirty-two
patients
underwent
periradicular
corticosteroid
injections
with
a
lateral
percutaneous
approach
under
fluoroscopic
guidance
to
treat
34
foci
of
chronic
cervical
radiculopathy
unresponsive
to
medical
treatment
alone
The
mean
evolutionary
trends
for
radicular
and
neck
pain
relief
were
significant
at
14
days
(P
<001)
and
at
6
months
(P

The
procedure
did
