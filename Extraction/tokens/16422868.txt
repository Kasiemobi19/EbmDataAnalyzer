Efficacy
of
sildenafil
citrate
(Viagra)
in
men
with
premature
ejaculation
Abstract
Text
Premature
ejaculation
(PE)
is
the
most
common
ejaculatory
dysfunction
We
assessed
the
efficacy
of
sildenafil
to
increase
the
time
to
ejaculation
improve
ejaculatory
control
and
decrease
the
postejaculatory
erectile
refractory
time
in
men
with
PE
The
main
study
was
an
8-week
double-blind
placebo-controlled
parallel
group
study
in
men
between
18
and
65
years
of
age
with
diagnosed
PE
A
substudy
was
also
conducted
using
a
subset
of
patients
(two-way
crossover
one
center)
before
entry
to
the
main
study
The
primary
study
measured
intravaginal
ejaculatory
latency
(IELT)
and
responses
to
the
Index
of
Premature
Ejaculation
(IPE)
questionnaire
The
substudy
measured
vibrotactile
stimulation
ejaculatory
latency
time
(VTS-ELT)
and
postejaculatory
erectile
refractory
time
Differences
between
treatment
groups
were
determined
by
ancova
at
the
5%
level
of
significance
The
change
in
IELT
(16
+/-
608
vs
06
+/-
207
minutes)
and
VTS-ELT
(29
+/-
04
vs
24
+/-
04
minutes)
were
higher
after
taking
sildenafil
compared
with
placebo
but
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
However
patients
who
took
sildenafil
(vs
placebo)
reported
significantly
(P
<
005)
increased
ejaculatory
control
(18
+/-
03
vs
15
+/-
03)
increased
ejaculatory
confidence
(22
+/-
02
vs
19
+/-
02)
and
improved
overall
sexual
satisfaction
scores
(31
+/-
02
vs
28
+/-
02)
on
the
IPE
and
had
a
decreased
postejaculatory
erectile
refractory
time
(32
+/-
07
vs
64
+/-
07
minutes)
The
most
common
adverse
events
for
sildenafil
(vs
placebo)
were
headache
(15%
vs
1%)
flushing
(15%
vs
0%)
dyspepsia
(5%
vs
1%)
abnormal
vision
(5%
vs
0%)
and
rhinitis
(5%
vs
0%)
Although
IELT
and
VTS-ELT
were
not
significantly
improved
sildenafil
increased
confidence
the
perception
of
ejaculatory
control
and
overall
sexual
satisfaction
and
decreased
the
refractory
time
to
achieve
a
second
erection
after
ejaculation
in
men
with
PE
