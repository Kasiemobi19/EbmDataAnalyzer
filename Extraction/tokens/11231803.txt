Title
Outcome
of
children
identified
as
anemic
by
routine
screening
in
an
inner-city
clinic
Abstract
Text
Children
found
to
be
anemic
on
routine
screening
by
HemoCue
a
rapid
and
relatively
inexpensive
method
of
screening
for
hemoglobin
(Hb)
are
often
prescribed
iron
as
a
diagnostic
tool
and
potential
treatment
for
presumed
iron
deficiency
anemia
(IDA)
We
questioned
this
approach
given
the
declining
prevalence
of
IDA
and
the
concomitant
relative
increase
in
other
causes
of
anemia
To
evaluate
the
practice
of
Hb
screening
for
IDA
by
determining
the
prevalence
of
anemia
by
HemoCue
the
proportion
of
anemic
patients
treated
with
iron
and
followed
up
the
frequency
of
repeated
Hb
testing
additional
iron
studies
and
iron
prescriptions
and
the
6-month
outcomes
of
treated
and
untreated
anemia
Retrospective
cohort
study
Of
1358
children
aged
9
to
36
months
who
underwent
screening
343
(25%)
had
anemia
defined
as
a
Hb
level
of
less
than
110
g/L
Outpatient
medical
records
of
334
of
the
anemic
children
revealed
that
239
(72%)
were
prescribed
iron
while
95
(28%)
were
not
prescribed
iron
at
the
first
visit
for
anemia
Anemia
follow-up
rates
were
low
for
the
prescribed
and
not
prescribed
groups
7%
vs
5%
returned
within
1
month
while
37%
vs
42%
did
not
return
within
6
months
for
follow-up
Of
the
children
who
were
prescribed
iron
107
(71%)
of
150
responded
to
treatment
or
anemia
resolved
within
6
months
compared
with
27
(68%)
of
40
not
prescribed
iron
Children
underwent
repeated
blood
testing
for
measurement
of
Hb
and
complete
blood
cell
count
but
underwent
few
iron-specific
studies
Routine
screening
for
IDA
by
HemoCue
followed
by
a
therapeutic
trial
of
iron
was
problematic
because
of
a
high
rate
of
anemia
in
this
predominantly
African
American
population
low
follow-up
rates
and
a
high
spontaneous
resolution
rate
Prospective
studies
are
needed
to
evaluate
other
screening
methods
to
differentiate
IDA
from
other
forms
of
anemia
and
to
improve
compliance
and
outcome
in
inner-city
children
