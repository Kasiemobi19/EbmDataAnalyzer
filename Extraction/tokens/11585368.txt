Autoantibodies
to

in

Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
prevalence
of
autoantibodies
to
IA-2
(IA-2Ab)
and
glutamic
acid
decarboxylase
(GADAb)
in
type
2
diabetes
their
relationship
to
disease
duration
and
their
importance
in
management
decisions
We
undertook
a
study
of
101
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
(defined
as
nonketotic
hyperglycemia
at
diagnosis)
of
varied
duration
(median
4
years)
Results
were
compared
with
those
from
36
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
also
of
varied
duration
(median
2
years)
IA-2Ab
and
GADAb
were
measured
by
radioligand-binding
assays
with
use
of
in
vitro-synthesized
35S-labeled
antigens
Of
the
101
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
20
(20%)
were
positive
for
GADAb
only
4
of
these
20
were
positive
for
IA-2Ab
In
comparison
75%
of
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
were
positive
for
GADAb
IA-2Ab
or
both
(P<00001)
The
coincidence
of
IA-2Ab
positivity
in
GADAb-positive
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
was
significantly
lower
than
in
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
(20%
versus
73%
respectively
P
=
0002)
All
four
IA-2Ab-
and
GADAb-positive
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
required
insulin
and
were
younger
than
those
positive
for
GADAb
alone
(P
=
0018)
GADAb
positivity
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
was
highly
associated
with
insulin
requirement
(P
=
0004)
with
an
odds
ratio
of
58
in
predicting
insulin
dependence
Among
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
receiving
insulin
therapy
disease
duration
was
significantly
shorter
(P
=
0025)
and
body
mass
index
was
significantly
lower
(P<0001)
in
GADAb-positive
versus
GADAb-negative
patients
In
contrast
to
type
1
diabetes
in
which
GADAb
values
were
negatively
correlated
with
disease
duration
(r
=
-034
P
=
0044)
no
significant
correlation
with
disease
duration
was
observed
in
type
2
diabetes
(r
=
-0166
P
=
048)
Irrespective
of
duration
of
disease
measurement
of
IA-2Ab
and
GADAb
can
help
to
identify
those
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
most
likely
to
require
insulin
therapy
