Title
The
rational
clinical
examination
Does
this
patient
have
a
torn
meniscus
or
ligament
of
the
knee
Value
of
the
physical
examination
Abstract
Text
While
most
meniscal
or
ligamentous
knee
injuries
heal
with
nonoperative
treatments
a
subset
should
be
treated
with
arthroscopic
or
open
surgery
To
analyze
the
accuracy
of
the
clinical
examination
for
meniscal
or
ligamentous
knee
injuries
MEDLINE
(1966-December
31
2000)
and
HealthSTAR
(1975-December
31
2000)
databases
were
searched
for
English-language
articles
describing
the
diagnostic
accuracy
of
individual
examination
items
for
the
knee
and
a
combination
of
physical
examination
items
(composite
examination)
Other
data
sources
included
reference
lists
from
relevant
articles
Studies
selected
for
data
extraction
were
those
that
compared
the
performance
of
the
physical
examination
of
the
knee
with
a
reference
standard
such
as
arthroscopy
arthrotomy
or
magnetic
resonance
imaging
Eighty-eight
articles
were
identified
of
which
23
(26%)
met
inclusion
criteria
A
rheumatologist
and
an
orthopedic
surgeon
independently
reviewed
each
article
using
a
standardized
rating
scale
that
scored
the
assembly
of
the
study
the
relevance
of
the
patients
enrolled
the
appropriateness
of
the
reference
standard
and
the
blinding
of
the
examiner
Summary
likelihood
ratios
(LRs)
were
estimated
from
random
effects
models
The
summary
LRs
for
physical
examination
for
tears
of
the
anterior
cruciate
ligament
using
the
anterior
drawer
test
were
38
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
07-220)
for
a
positive
examination
and
030
(95%
CI
005-150)
for
a
negative
examination
the
Lachman
test
250
(95%
CI
27-6510)
and
01
(95%
CI
00-04)
and
the
composite
assessment
250
(95%
CI
21-3060)
and
004
(95%
CI
001-048)
respectively
The
LRs
could
not
be
generated
for
any
specific
examination
maneuver
for
a
posterior
cruciate
ligament
tear
but
the
composite
assessment
had
an
LR
of
210
(95%
CI
21-2050)
for
a
positive
examination
and
005
(95%
CI
001-050)
for
a
negative
examination
Determination
of
meniscal
lesions
using
McMurray
test
had
an
LR
of
13
(95%
CI
09-17)
for
a
positive
examination
and
08
(95%
CI
06-11)
for
a
negative
examination
joint
line
tenderness
09
(95%
CI
08-10)
and
11
(95%
CI
10-13)
and
the
composite
assessment
27
(95%
CI
14-51)
and
04
(95%
CI
02-07)
respectively
The
composite
examination
for
specific
meniscal
or
ligamentous
injuries
of
the
knee
performed
much
better
than
specific
maneuvers
suggesting
that
synthesis
of
a
group
of
examination
maneuvers
and
historical
items
may
be
required
for
adequate
diagnosis
