An
analysis

the
effectiveness
of
interventions
intended
to
help
people
stop
smoking
Abstract
Text
In
a
systematic
review
of
the
efficacy
of
interventions
intended
to
help
people
stop
smoking
data
have
been
analyzed
from
188
randomized
controlled
trials
Following
personal
advice
and
encouragement
to
stop
smoking
given
by
physicians
during
a
single
routine
consultation
an
estimated
2%
(95%
confidence
limits
1%
3%
P
<
001)
of
all
smokers
stopped
smoking
and
did
not
relapse
up
to
1
year
as
a
direct
consequence
of
the
advice
The
effect
is
modest
but
cost-effective
the
cost
of
saving
a
life
is
about
$1500
Supplementary
interventions
(follow-up
letters
or
visits
demonstration
of
spirometry
etc)
have
an
additional
effect--variable
in
extent
Advice
and
encouragement
are
particularly
effective
for
smokers
at
special
risk--pregnant
women
(efficacy
8%)
and
patients
with
ischemic
heart
disease
Behavior
modification
techniques
(relaxation
rewards
and
punishment
avoiding
"trigger"
situations
etc)
in
group
or
individual
sessions
led
by
a
psychologist
have
an
effect
that
is
statistically
significant
(P
=
05)
but
no
greater
than
simple
advice
by
a
physician
(2%)
yet
these
techniques
are
several
times
more
expensive
The
effect
of
hypnosis
is
unproved
(no
trials
have
used
biochemical
markers)
Nicotine
replacement
therapy
is
effective
in
an
estimated
13%
of
smokers
who
seek
help
in
cessation
the
effect
is
greater
in
those
who
are
nicotine-dependent
Other
pharmacological
treatments
are
not
of
proven
efficacy
and
acupuncture
is
ineffective
Sudden
cessation
or
gradual
reduction
in
smoking
are
similar
in
their
efficacy
on
average
Physicians
should
take
time
to
advise
all
their
patients
who
smoke
to
quit
Smokers
who
are
intent
on
stopping
should
be
given
additional
support
and
encouraged
to
use
nicotine
replacement
therapy
