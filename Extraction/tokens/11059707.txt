Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
performance
of
transient
evoked
otoacoustic
emissions
(TEOAEs)
distortion
product
otoacoustic
emissions
(DPOAEs)
and
auditory
brain
stem
responses
(ABRs)
as
tools
for
identification
of
neonatal
hearing
impairment
A
total
of
4911
infants
including
4478
graduates
of
neonatal
intensive
care
units
353
well
babies
with
one
or
more
risk
factors
for
hearing
loss
(Joint
Committee
on
Infant
Hearing
1994)
and
80
well
babies
without
risk
factor
who
did
not
pass
one
or
more
neonatal
test
were
targeted
as
the
potential
subject
pool
on
which
test
performance
would
be
assessed
During
the
neonatal
period
they
were
evaluated
using
TEOAEs
in
response
to
an
80
dB
pSPL
click
DPOAE
responses
to
two
stimulus
conditions
(L1
=
L2
=
75
dB
SPL
and
L1
=
65
dB
SPL
L2
=
50
dB
SPL)
and
ABR
elicited
by
a
30
dB
nHL
click
In
an
effort
to
describe
test
performance
these
"at-risk"
infants
were
asked
to
return
for
behavioral
audiologic
assessments
using
visual
reinforcement
audiometry
(VRA)
at
8
to
12
mo
corrected
age
regardless
of
neonatal
test
results
Sixty-four
percent
of
these
subjects
returned
and
reliable
VRA
data
were
obtained
on
956%
of
these
returnees
This
approach
is
in
contrast
to
previous
studies
in
which
by
necessity
efforts
were
made
to
follow
only
those
infants
who
"failed"
the
neonatal
screening
tests
The
accuracy
of
the
neonatal
measures
in
predicting
hearing
status
at
8
to
12
mo
corrected
age
was
determined
Only
those
infants
who
provided
reliable
monaural
VRA
test
results
were
included
in
the
analysis
Separate
analyses
were
performed
without
regard
to
intercurrent
events
(ie
events
between
the
neonatal
and
VRA
tests
that
could
cause
their
results
to
disagree)
and
then
after
accounting
for
the
possible
influence
of
intercurrent
events
such
as
otitis
media
and
late-onset
or
progressive
hearing
loss
Low
refer
rates
were
achieved
for
the
stopping
criteria
used
in
the
present
study
especially
when
a
protocol
similar
to
the
one
recommended
in
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(1993)
Consensus
Conference
Report
was
followed
These
analyses
however
do
not
completely
describe
test
performance
because
they
did
not
compare
neonatal
screening
test
results
with
a
gold
standard
test
of
hearing
Test
performance
as
measured
by
the
area
under
a
relative
operating
characteristic
curve
were
similar
for
all
three
neonatal
tests
when
neonatal
test
results
were
compared
with
VRA
data
obtained
at
8
to
12
mo
corrected
age
However
ABRs
were
more
successful
at
determining
auditory
status
at
1
kHz
compared
with
the
otoacoustic
emission
(OAE)
tests
Performance
was
more
similar
across
all
three
tests
when
they
were
used
to
identify
hearing
loss
at
2
and
4
kHz
No
test
performed
perfectly
Using
either
the
two-
or
three-frequency
pure-tone
average
(PTA)
with
a
fixed
false
alarm
rate
of
20%
hit
rates
for
the
neonatal
tests
in
general
exceeded
80%
when
hearing
impairment
was
defined
as
behavioral
thresholds
>
or
=30
dB
HL
All
three
tests
performed
similarly
when
a
two-frequency
(2
and
4
kHz)
PTA
was
used
as
the
gold
standard
OAE
test
performance
decreased
when
a
three-frequency
PTA
(adding
1
kHz)
was
used
as
the
gold
standard
definition
For
both
PTA
and
all
three
neonatal
screening
measures
however
hit
rate
increased
as
the
magnitude
of
hearing
loss
increased
Singly
all
three
neonatal
hearing
screening
tests
resulted
in
low
refer
rates
especially
if
referrals
for
follow-up
were
made
only
for
the
cases
in
which
stopping
criteria
were
not
met
in
both
ears
Following
a
protocol
similar
to
that
recommended
in
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(1993)
Consensus
Conference
report
resulted
in
refer
rates
that
were
less
than
4%
TEOAEs

during
the

period
