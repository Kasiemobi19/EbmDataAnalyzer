Evolution
of
the
serologic
response
to
Borrelia
burgdorferi
in
treated
patients
with
culture-confirmed
erythema
migrans
Abstract
Text
We
investigated
the
appearance
and
evolution
of
immunoglobulin
M
(IgM)
and
IgG
antibodies
to
Borrelia
burgdorferi
in
46
patients
with
culture-proven
erythema
migrans
(EM)
All
patients
received
antimicrobial
treatment
and
were
prospectively
evaluated
for
up
to
1
year
A
total
of
257
serially
collected
serum
samples
were
tested
by
commercial
IgG-IgM
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
and
separate
IgM
and
IgG
immunoblots
(IBs)
At
the
baseline
33%
of
the
patients
had
a
positive
ELISA
result
and
43%
of
the
patients
had
a
positive
IgM
IB
result
by
using
the
criteria
of
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention-Association
of
State
and
Territorial
Public
Health
Laboratory
Directors
for
the
interpretation
of
IB
results
Positive
serology
at
the
baseline
and
the
rate
of
seroconversion
correlated
directly
with
disease
duration
and/or
evidence
of
dissemination
prior
to
treatment
At
days
8
to
14
after
the
baseline
91%
of
patients
had
a
positive
ELISA
result
and/or
IgM
IB
result
Peak
IgM
antibody
levels
were
seen
at
this
time
in
patients
with
localized
or
disseminated
disease
The
most
frequent
IgM
bands
at
the
baseline
and
the
peak
were
of
24
kDa
(OspC)
41
kDa
and
37
kDa
Although
89%
of
the
patients
developed
IgG
antibodies
as
determined
at
a
follow-up
examination
only
22%
were
positive
by
the
IgG
IB
criteria
of
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention-Association
of
State
and
Territorial
Public
Health
Laboratory
Directors
The
persistence
of
antibodies
was
directly
related
to
disease
duration
and/or
dissemination
prior
to
treatment
Since
IgM
antibodies
to
the
24-
and
41-kDa
antigens
remained
detectable
for
long
periods
38%
of
IgM
IBs
were
still
positive
at
1
year
postbaseline
IgM
to
antigens
of
39
58
60
66
or
93
kDa
conversely
were
most
often
seen
in
sera
obtained
within
1
month
postbaseline
Their
presence
may
be
of
assistance
in
confirming
a
recent
infection
with
B
burgdorferi
in
individuals
living
in
areas
where
Lyme
disease
is
endemic
