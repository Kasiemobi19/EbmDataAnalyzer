Abstract
Text
Although
a
quarter
of
US
women
undergo
elective
hysterectomy
before
menopause
controlled
trials
that
evaluate
the
benefits
and
harms
are
lacking
To
compare
the
effect
of
hysterectomy
vs
expanded
medical
treatment
on
health-related
quality
of
life
A
multicenter
randomized
controlled
trial
(August
1997-December
2000)
of
63
premenopausal
women
aged
30
to
50
years
with
abnormal
uterine
bleeding
for
a
median
of
4
years
who
were
dissatisfied
with
medical
treatments
including
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
The
participants
who
were
patients
at
gynecology
clinics
and
affiliated
practices
of
4
US
academic
medical
centers
were
followed
up
for
2
years
Participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
undergo
hysterectomy
or
expanded
medical
treatment
with
estrogen
and/or
progesterone
and/or
a
prostaglandin
synthetase
inhibitor
The
hysterectomy
route
and
medical
regimen
were
determined
by
the
participating
gynecologist
The
primary
outcome
was
mental
health
measured
by
the
Mental
Component
Summary
(MCS)
of
the
36-Item
Short-Form
Health
Survey
(SF-36)
Secondary
outcomes
included
physical
health
measured
by
the
Physical
Component
Summary
(PCS)
symptom
resolution
and
satisfaction
body
image
and
sexual
functioning
as
well
as
other
aspects
of
mental
health
and
general
health
perceptions
At
6
months
women
in
the
hysterectomy
group
had
greater
improvement
in
MCS
scores
than
women
in
the
medicine
group
(8
vs
2
P
=04)
They
also
had
greater
improvement
in
symptom
resolution
(75
vs
29
P<001)
symptom
satisfaction
(44
vs
7
P<001)
interference
with
sex
(41
vs
22
P
=003)
sexual
desire
(21
vs

P

health
distress
(33
vs

sleep

(13
vs

P

overall
health
(12
vs
2
P
=006)
and
satisfaction
with
health
(31
vs
14
P
=01)
By
the
end
of
the
study
17
(53%)
of
the
women
in
the
medicine
group
had
requested
and
received
hysterectomy
and
these
women
reported
improvements
in
quality-of-life
outcomes
during
the
2
years
that
were
similar
to
those
reported
by
women
randomized
to
the
hysterectomy
group
Women
who
continued
medical
treatment
also
reported
some
improvements
(P<001
for
within-group
change
in
many
outcomes)
with
the
result
that
most
differences
between
randomized
groups
at
the
end
of
the
study
were
no
longer
statistically
significant
in
the
intention-to-treat
analysis
Among
women
with
abnormal
uterine
bleeding
and
dissatisfaction
with
medroxyprogesterone
hysterectomy
was
superior
to
expanded
medical
treatment
for
improving
health-related
quality-of-life
after
6
months
With
longer
follow-up
half
the
women
randomized
to
medicine
elected
to
undergo
hysterectomy
with
similar
and
lasting
quality-of-life
improvements
those
who
continued
medical
treatment
also
reported
some
improvements
