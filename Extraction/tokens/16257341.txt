Should
beta
blockers
remain
first
choice
in
the
treatment
of
primary
hypertension
A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Beta
blockers
have
been
used
widely
in
the
treatment
of
hypertension
and
are
recommended
as
first-line
drugs
in
hypertension
guidelines
However
a
preliminary
analysis
has
shown
that
atenolol
is
not
very
effective
in
hypertension
We
aim
to
substantially
enlarge
the
data
on
atenolol
and
analyse
the
effect
of
different
beta
blockers
The
Cochrane
Library
and
PubMed
were
searched
for
beta
blocker
treatment
in
patients
with
primary
hypertension
Data
were
then
entered
into
the
Cochrane
Collaboration
Review
Manager
package
and
were
summarised
in
meta-analyses
13
randomised
controlled
trials
(n=105
951)
were
included
in
a
meta-analysis
comparing
treatment
with
beta
blockers
with
other
antihypertensive
drugs
Seven
studies
(n=27
433)
were
included
in
a
comparison
of
beta
blockers
and
placebo
or
no
treatment
The
relative
risk
of
stroke
was
16%
higher
for
beta
blockers
(95%
CI
4-30%)
than
for
other
drugs
There
was
no
difference
for
myocardial
infarction
When
the
effect
of
beta
blockers
was
compared
with
that
of
placebo
or
no
treatment
the
relative
risk
of
stroke
was
reduced
by
19%
for
all
beta
blockers
(7-29%)
about
half
that
expected
from
previous
hypertension
trials
There
was
no
difference
for
myocardial
infarction
or
mortality
In
comparison
with
other
antihypertensive
drugs
the
effect
of
beta
blockers
is
less
than
optimum
with
a
raised
risk
of
stroke
Hence
we
believe
that
beta
blockers
should
not
remain
first
choice
in
the
treatment
of
primary
hypertension
and
should
not
be
used
as
reference
drugs
in
future
randomised
controlled
trials
of
hypertension
