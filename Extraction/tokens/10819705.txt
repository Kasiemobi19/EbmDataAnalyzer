Accuracy

the
Papanicolaou
test
in
screening
for
and

of
cervical

abnormalities
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
accuracy
of
conventional
and
new
methods
of
Papanicolaou
(Pap)
testing
when
used
to
detect
cervical
cancer
and
its
precursors
Systematic
search
of
English-language
literature
through
October
1999
using
MEDLINE
EMBASE
other
computerized
databases
and
hand
searching
All
studies
that
compared
Pap
testing
(conventional
methods
computer
screening
or
rescreening
or
monolayer
cytology)
with
a
concurrent
reference
standard
(histologic
examination
colposcopy
or
cytology)
Two
reviewers
independently
reviewed
selection
criteria
and
completed
2
x
2
tables
for
each
study
94
studies
of
the
conventional
Pap
test
and
three
studies
of
monolayer
cytology
met
inclusion
criteria
No
studies
of
computerized
screening
were
included
Data
were
organized
by
cytologic
and
histologic
thresholds
used
to
define
disease
For
conventional
Pap
tests
estimates
of
sensitivity
and
specificity
varied
greatly
in
individual
studies
Methodologic
quality
and
frequency
of
histologic
abnormalities
also
varied
greatly
between
studies
In
the
12
studies
with
the
least
biased
estimates
sensitivity
ranged
from
30%
to
87%
and
specificity
ranged
from
86%
to
100%
Insufficient
high-quality
data
exist
to
estimate
test
operating
characteristics
of
new
cytologic
methods
for
cervical
screening
Future
studies
of
these
technologies
should
apply
adequate
reference
standards
Most
studies
of
the
conventional
Pap
test
are
severely
biased
The
best
estimates
suggest
that
it
is
only
moderately
accurate
and
does
not
achieve
concurrently
high
sensitivity
and
specificity
Cost-effectiveness
models
of
cervical
cancer
screening
should
use
more
conservative
estimates
of
Pap
test
sensitivity
