Title
Antidepressants
for
smoking
cessation
Abstract
Text
There
are
at
least
two
theoretical
reasons
to
believe
antidepressants
might
help
in
smoking
cessation
Nicotine
withdrawal
may
produce
depressive
symptoms
or
precipitate
a
major
depressive
episode
and
antidepressants
may
relieve
these
Nicotine
may
have
antidepressant
effects
that
maintain
smoking
and
antidepressants
may
substitute
for
this
effect
Alternatively
some
antidepressants
may
have
a
specific
effect
on
neural
pathways
underlying
nicotine
addiction
(eg
blocking
nicotine
receptors)
independent
of
their
antidepressant
effects
The
aim
of
this
review
is
to
assess
the
effect
of
antidepressant
medications
in
aiding
long-term
smoking
cessation
The
medications
include
bupropion
doxepin
fluoxetine
imipramine
moclobemide
nortriptyline
paroxetine
sertraline
tryptophan
and
venlafaxine
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Tobacco
Addiction
Group
trials
register
which
includes
trials
indexed
in
MEDLINE
EMBASE
SciSearch
and
PsycINFO
and
other

We
considered
randomized
trials
comparing
antidepressant
medications
to
placebo
or
an
alternative
pharmacotherapy
for
smoking
cessation
We
also
included
trials
comparing
different
doses
using
pharmacotherapy
to
prevent
relapse
or
re-initiate
smoking
cessation
or
to
help
smokers
reduce
cigarette
consumption
We
excluded
trials
with
less
than
six
months
follow
up
We
extracted
data
in
duplicate
on
the
type
of
study
population
the
nature
of
the
pharmacotherapy
the
outcome
measures
method
of
randomization
and
completeness
of
follow
up
The
main
outcome
measure
was
abstinence
from
smoking
after
at
least
six
months
follow
up
in
patients
smoking
at
baseline
expressed
as
an
odds
ratio
(OR)
We
used
the
most
rigorous
definition
of
abstinence
available
in
each
trial
and
biochemically
validated
rates
if
available
Where
appropriate
we
performed
meta-analysis
using
a
fixed-effect
model
Seventeen
new
trials
were
identified
since
the
last
update
in
2004
bringing
the
total
number
of
included
trials
to
53
There
were
40
trials
of
bupropion
and
eight
trials
of
nortriptyline
When
used
as
the
sole
pharmacotherapy
bupropion
(31
trials
odds
ratio
[OR]
194
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
172
to
219)
and
nortriptyline
(four
trials
OR
234
95%
CI
161
to
341)
both
doubled
the
odds
of
cessation
There
is
insufficient
evidence
that
adding
bupropion
or
nortriptyline
to
nicotine
replacement
therapy
provides
an
additional
long-term
benefit
Three
trials
of
extended
therapy
with
bupropion
to
prevent
relapse
after
initial
cessation
did
not
find
evidence
of
a
significant
long-term
benefit
From
the
available
data
bupropion
and
nortriptyline
appear
to
be
equally
effective
and
of
similar
efficacy
to
nicotine
replacement
therapy
Pooling
three
trials
comparing
bupropion
to
varenicline
showed
a
lower
odds
of
quitting
with
bupropion
(OR
060
95%
CI
046
to
078)
There
is
a
risk
of
about
1
in
1000
of
seizures
associated
with
bupropion
use
Concerns
that
bupropion
may
increase
suicide
risk
are
currently
unproven
Nortriptyline
has
the
potential
for
serious
side-effects
but
none
have
been
seen
in
the
few
small
trials
for
smoking
cessation
There
were
six
trials
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
four
of
fluoxetine
one
of
sertraline
and
one
of
paroxetine
None
of
these
detected
significant
long-term
effects
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
significant
benefit
when
results
were
pooled
There
was
one
trial
of
the
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitor
moclobemide
and
one
of
the
atypical
antidepressant
venlafaxine
Neither
of
these
detected
a
significant
long-term
benefit
The
antidepressants
bupropion
and
nortriptyline
aid
long-term
smoking
cessation
but
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(eg
fluoxetine)
do
not
Evidence
suggests
that
the
mode
of
action
of
bupropion
and
nortriptyline
is
independent
of
their
antidepressant
effect
and
that
they
are
of
similar
efficacy
to
nicotine
replacement
Adverse
events
with
both
medications
are
rarely
serious
or
lead
to
stopping
medication
