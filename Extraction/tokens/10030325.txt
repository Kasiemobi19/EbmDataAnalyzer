Abstract
Text
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitors
have
been
used
for
more
than
a
decade
to
treat
high
blood
pressure
despite
the
lack
of
data
from
randomised
intervention
trials
to
show
that
such
treatment
affects
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
The
Captopril
Prevention
Project
(CAPPP)
is
a
randomised
intervention
trial
to
compare
the
effects
of
ACE
inhibition
and
conventional
therapy
on
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
in
patients
with
hypertension
CAPPP
was
a
prospective
randomised
open
trial
with
blinded
endpoint
evaluation
10985
patients
were
enrolled
at
536
health
centres
in
Sweden
and
Finland
Patients
aged
25-66
years
with
a
measured
diastolic
blood
pressure
of
100
mm
Hg
or
more
on
two
occasions
were
randomly
assigned
captopril
or
conventional
antihypertensive
treatment
(diuretics
beta-blockers)
Analysis
was
by
intention-to-treat
The
primary
endpoint
was
a
composite
of
fatal
and
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
stroke
and
other
cardiovascular
deaths
Of
5492
patients
assigned
captopril
and
5493
assigned
conventional
therapy
14
and
13
respectively
were
lost
to
follow-up
Primary
endpoint
events
occurred
in
363
patients
in
the
captopril
group
(111
per
1000
patient-years)
and
335
in
the
conventional-treatment
group
(102
per
1000
patient-years
relative
risk
105
[95%
CI
090-122]
p=0-52)
Cardiovascular
mortality
was
lower
with
captopril
than
with
conventional
treatment
(76
vs
95
events
relative
risk
077
[057-1-04]
p=0092)
the
rate
of
fatal
and
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
was
similar
(162
vs
161)
but
fatal
and
non-fatal
stroke
was
more
common
with
captopril
(189
vs
148
125
[1-01-1-55]
p=0044)
Captopril
and
conventional
treatment
did
not
differ
in
efficacy
in
preventing
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
The
difference
in
stroke
risk
is
probably
due
to
the
lower
levels
of
blood
pressure
obtained
initially
in
previously
treated
patients
randomised
to
conventional
therapy
