Title
Treatment
of
fibromyalgia
with
cyclobenzaprine
A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
To
systematically
review
the
effectiveness
of
cyclobenzaprine
in
the
treatment
of
fibromyalgia
Articles
describing
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
of
cyclobenzaprine
in
people
with
fibromyalgia
were
obtained
from
Medline
EMBase
Psyclit
the
Cochrane
Library
and
Federal
Research
in
Progress
Database
Unpublished
literature
and
bibliographies
were
also
reviewed
Outcomes
including
global
improvement
treatment
effects
on
pain
fatigue
sleep
and
tender
points
over
time
were
abstracted
Five
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
were
identified
The
odds
ratio
for
global
improvement
with
therapy
was
30
(95%
confidence
interval
[95%
CI]
16-56)
with
a
pooled
risk
difference
of
021
(95%
CI
009-034)
which
calculates
to
48
(95%
CI
30-11)
individuals
needing
treatment
for
1
patient
to
experience
symptom
improvement
Pain
improved
early
on
but
there
was
no
improvement
in
fatigue
or
tender
points
at
any
time
Cyclobenzaprine-treated
patients
were
3
times
as
likely
to
report
overall
improvement
and
to
report
moderate
reductions
in
individual
symptoms
particularly
sleep
