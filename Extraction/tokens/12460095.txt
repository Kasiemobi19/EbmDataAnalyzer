Abstract
Text
Sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(SIDS)
is
a
leading
cause
of
postneonatal
mortality
among
American
Indians
a
group
whose
infant
death
rate
is
consistently
above
the
US
national
average
To
determine
prenatal
and
postnatal
risk
factors
for
SIDS
among
American
Indians
Population-based
case-control
study
of
33
SIDS
infants
and
66
matched
living
controls
among
American
Indians
in
South
Dakota
North
Dakota
Nebraska
and
Iowa
enrolled
from
December
1992
to
November
1996
and
investigated
using
standardized
parental
interview
medical
record
abstraction
autopsy
protocol
and
infant
death
review
Association
of
SIDS
with
maternal
socioeconomic
and
behavioral
factors
health
care
utilization
and
infant
care
practices
The
proportions
of
case
and
control
infants
who
were
usually
placed
prone
to
sleep
(152%
and
136%
respectively)
who
shared
a
bed
with
parents
(594%
and
554%)
or
whose
mothers
smoked
during
pregnancy
(697%
and
546%)
were
similar
However
mothers
of
727%
of
case
infants
and
455%
of
control
infants
engaged
in
binge
drinking
during
pregnancy
Conditional
logistic
regression
revealed
significant
associations
between
SIDS
and
2
or
more
layers
of
clothing
on
the
infant
(adjusted
odds
ratio
[aOR]

[CI]

any
visits
by
a
public
health
nurse
(aOR

95%
CI
01-08)
periconceptional
maternal
alcohol
use
(aOR

95%
CI
16-233)
and
maternal
first-trimester
binge
drinking
(aOR

CI
19-353)
Public
health
nurse
visits
maternal
alcohol
use
during
the
periconceptional
period
and
first
trimester
and
layers
of
clothing
are
important
risk
factors
for
SIDS
among
Northern
Plains
Indians
Strengthening
public
health
nurse
visiting
programs
and
programs
to
reduce
alcohol
consumption
among
women
of
childbearing
age
could
potentially
reduce
the
high
rate
of
SIDS
