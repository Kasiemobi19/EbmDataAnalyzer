Title
Effect
of
ramipril
vs
amlodipine
on
renal
outcomes
in
hypertensive
nephrosclerosis
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Incidence
of
end-stage
renal
disease
due
to
hypertension
has
increased
in
recent
decades
but
the
optimal
strategy
for
treatment
of
hypertension
to
prevent
renal
failure
is
unknown
especially
among
African
Americans
To
compare
the
effects
of
an
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(ACE)
inhibitor
(ramipril)
a
dihydropyridine
calcium
channel
blocker
(amlodipine)
and
a
beta-blocker
(metoprolol)
on
hypertensive
renal
disease
progression
Interim
analysis
of
a
randomized
double-blind
3
x
2
factorial
trial
conducted
in
1094
African
Americans
aged
18
to
70
years
with
hypertensive
renal
disease
(glomerular
filtration
rate
[GFR]
of
20-65
mL/min
per
173
m(2))
enrolled
between
February
1995
and
September
1998
This
report
compares
the
ramipril
and
amlodipine
groups
following
discontinuation
of
the
amlodipine
intervention
in
September
2000
Participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
amlodipine
5
to
10
mg/d
(n
=
217)
ramipril
25
to
10
mg/d
(n
=
436)
or
metoprolol
50
to
200
mg/d
(n
=
441)
with
other
agents
added
to
achieve
1
of
2
blood
pressure
goals
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
the
rate
of
change
in
GFR
the
main
secondary
outcome
was
a
composite
index
of
the
clinical
end
points
of
reduction
in
GFR
of
more
than
50%
or
25
mL/min
per
173
m(2)
end-stage
renal
disease
or
death
Among
participants
with
a
urinary
protein
to
creatinine
ratio
of
>022
(corresponding
approximately
to
proteinuria
of
more
than
300
mg/d)
the
ramipril
group
had
a
36%
(202
[SE
074]
mL/min
per
173
m(2)/y)
slower
mean
decline
in
GFR
over
3
years
(P
=006)
and
a
48%
reduced
risk
of
the
clinical
end
points
vs
the
amlodipine
group
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
20%-66%)
In
the
entire
cohort
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
mean
GFR
decline
from
baseline
to
3
years
between
treatment
groups
(P
=38)
However
compared
with
the
amlodipine
group
after
adjustment
for
baseline
covariates
the
ramipril
group
had
a
38%
reduced
risk
of
clinical
end
points
(95%
CI
13%-56%)
a
36%
slower
mean
decline
in
GFR
after
3
months
(P
=002)
and
less
proteinuria
(P<001)
Ramipril
compared
with
amlodipine
retards
renal
disease
progression
in
patients
with
hypertensive
renal
disease
and
proteinuria
and
may
offer
benefit
to
patients
without
proteinuria
