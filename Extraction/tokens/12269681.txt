Title
Randomised
controlled
trial
of
reflexology
for
menopausal
symptoms
Abstract
Text
Clinical
experience
suggests
that
reflexology
may
have
beneficial
effects
on
the
symptoms
occurring
in
menopausal
women
particularly
psychological
symptoms
This
study
aims
to
examine
that
effect
rigorously
Randomised
controlled
trial
with
two
parallel
arms
School
of
Complementary
Health
in
Exeter
Devon
UK
Seventy-six
women
aged
between
45
and
60
years
reporting
menopausal
symptoms
Women
were
randomised
to
receive
nine
sessions
of
either
reflexology
or
nonspecific
foot
massage
(control)
by
four
qualified
reflexologists
given
over
a
period
of
19
weeks
The
Women's
Health
Questionnaire
(WHQ)
the
primary
measures
being
the
subscores
for
anxiety
and
depression
Severity
(visual
analogue
scale
VAS)
and
frequency
of
flushes
and
night
sweats
Mean
(SD)
scores
for
anxiety
fell
from
043
(029)
to
022
(025)
in
the
reflexology
group
and
from
037
(027)
to
027
(029)
in
the
control
group
over
the
course
of
treatment
Mean
(SD)
scores
for
depression
fell
from
037
(025)
to
020
(024)
in
the
reflexology
group
and
from
036
(023)
to
020
(021)
in
the
control
(foot
massage)
group
over
the
same
period
For
both
scores
there
was
strong
evidence
of
a
time
effect
(P
<
0001)
but
no
evidence
of
a
time-group
interaction
(P
>
02)
Similar
changes
were
found
for
severity
of
hot
flushes
and
night
sweats
In
the
control
group
14/37
believed
they
had
not
received
true
reflexology
Foot
reflexology
was
not
shown
to
be
more
effective
than
non-specific
foot
massage
in
the
treatment
of
psychological
symptoms
occurring
during
the
menopause
