Bupropion
SR
vs
methylphenidate
vs
placebo
for
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
in
adults
Abstract
Text
Despite
the
increasing
recognition
of
attention-deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
in
adults
there
are
few
controlled
trials
demonstrating
the
effectiveness
of
pharmacological
treatments
particularly
with
nonstimulants
One
controlled
trial
found
bupropion
SR
more
effective
than
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
ADHD
adults
We
conducted
a
controlled
study
to
contrast
the
effectiveness
of
bupropion
SR
and
methylphenidate
to
placebo
in
ADHD
adults
A
randomized
double-blind
parallel
design
was
used
in
this
study
Following
a
7-day
placebo
lead-in
30
ADHD
(DSM-IV)
subjects
(18-60
years
old)
were
randomized
to
bupropion
methylphenidate
or
placebo
for
7
weeks
Methylphenidate
was
titrated
over
1
week
to
a
maximum
dose
of
09
mg/kg/d
divided
into
3
doses
while
bupropion
was
titrated
over
2
weeks
to
a
maximum
dose
of
200
mg
AM
and
100
mg
PM
Response
rates
based
on
Clinical
Global
Impression
improvement
ratings
in
patients
receiving
bupropion
methylphenidate
and
placebo
were
64
50
and
27%
respectively
The
difference
in
response
rates
between
active
treatment
and
placebo
was
not
statistically
significant
(p
=
014)
Neuropsychological
testing
demonstrated
trends
favoring
drug
treatment
on
measures
of
immediate
recall
and
verbal
fluency
While
bupropion
SR
may
be
a
viable
clinical
alternative
for
adults
with
ADHD
further
investigation
is
needed
