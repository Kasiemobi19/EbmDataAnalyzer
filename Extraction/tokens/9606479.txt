Abstract
Text
To
review
the
pharmacology
and
pharmacokinetics
of
glucosamine
and
critically
evaluate
currently
available
literature
regarding
its
safety
and
efficacy
A
MEDLINE
search
was
conducted
between
January
1965
and
May
1997
Key
words
used
in
the
search
were
osteoarthritis
osteoarthrosis
gonarthrosis
and
glucosamine
In
addition
references
cited
in
articles
obtained
from
the
MEDLINE
search
were
reviewed
for
additional
literature
All
articles
were
considered
for
inclusion
in
the
review
Articles
were
excluded
from
critical
evaluation
for
lack
of
randomization
lack
of
a
control
group
30
or
fewer
study
participants
inconsistent
treatment
regimen
incomplete
dosing
information
or
incomplete
reporting
of
results
Osteoarthritis
affects
approximately
12%
of
the
US
population
the
incidence
increases
with
increasing
age
Currently
used
pharmacologic
treatments
including
acetaminophen
and
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
do
not
slow
or
reverse
the
degenerative
process
in
osteoarthritis
Glucosamine
has
recently
received
a
great
deal
of
attention
from
the
public
as
a
potential
treatment
of
osteoarthritis
prompting
healthcare
professionals
to
investigate
its
clinical
usefulness
and
potential
for
adverse
effects
The
drug
has
been
proposed
to
stop
and
possibly
reverse
the
degenerative
process
in
osteoarthritis
Following
absorption
of
an
oral
dose
glucosamine
is
incorporated
into
plasma
proteins
during
first-pass
metabolism
resulting
in
26%
bioavailability
Unbound
glucosamine
is
concentrated
in
the
articular
cartilage
Each
of
the
three
critically
evaluated
studies
reported
a
decrease
in
the
symptoms
of
osteoarthritis
(eg
decreased
Lequesne
index
decreased
pain
severity
increased
range
of
motion)
for
the
glucosamine
group
which
was
greater
than
that
obtained
in
the
control
group
Flaws
in
study
design
however
prevent
the
use
of
these
results
in
modifying
current
clinical
practice
Reported
short-term
adverse
effects
include
mild
gastrointestinal
problems
drowsiness
skin
reactions
and
headache
Improvement
in
the
symptoms
of
osteoarthritis
associated
with
the
use
of
glucosamine
has
been
observed
in
clinical
trials
however
those
trials
have
flaws
in
design
and
data
analysis
Further
research
needs
to
be
conducted
before
glucosamine
can
be
recommended
as
a
treatment
for
osteoarthritis
