Title
Treatment
of
naturally
acquired
common
colds
with
zinc
a
structured
review
Abstract
Text
Over
the
past
20
years
the
use
of
zinc
as
an
over-the-counter
alternative
therapy
for
the
common
cold
has
vastly
grown
in
popularity
Recent
reports
of
potentially
permanent
anosmia
caused
by
intranasal
zinc
therapy
warrant
careful
analysis
of
the
therapeutic
effects
of
zinc
A
search
of
the
Medline
database
(including
articles
published
during
1966-2006)
for
studies
of
zinc
and
the
common
cold
produced
105
published
reports
Fourteen
were
randomized
placebo-controlled
studies
that
examined
the
effect
of
zinc
lozenges
nasal
sprays
or
nasal
gels
on
naturally
acquired
common
colds
Eleven
features
of
experimental
design
affecting
signal
quality
chance
bias
and
blinding
were
used
to
evaluate
the
14
placebo-controlled
studies
These
criteria
were
validated

description
of
methods
of
analysis
and
measurements
of
probability
Equal
weight
was
given
to
each
criterion
because
failure
to
meet
any
one
could
potentially
invalidate
the
findings
of
a
clinical
trial
Four
studies
met
all
11
criteria
Three
of
these
studies
reported
no
therapeutic
effect
from
zinc
lozenge
or
nasal
spray
One
study
reported
positive
results
from
zinc
nasal
gel
Of
the
remaining
10
studies
6
reported
a
positive
effect
and
4
reported
no
effect
Intent-to-treat
analysis
was
the
most
common
criterion
not
met
This
structured
review
suggests
that
the
therapeutic
effectiveness
of
zinc
lozenges
has
yet
to
be
established
One
well-designed
study
did
report
a
positive
effect
of
zinc
nasal
gel
