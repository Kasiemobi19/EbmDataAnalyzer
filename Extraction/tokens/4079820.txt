A
longitudinal
study
of
the
effects
of
menopause
on
sexuality
Abstract
Text
From
an
initial
group
of
39
16
cycling
peri-menopausal
women
completed
a
longitudinal
study
in
which
they
recorded
menstrual
and
sexual
behavior
daily
and
were
interviewed
at
roughly
4-mth
intervals
until
1
yr
or
more
without
cycling
At
each
interview
women
gave
20-ml
blood
samples
completed
sexuality
questionnaires
and
rated
themselves
for
menopausal
symptoms
As
predicted
the
difference
in
weekly
rate
of
sexual
intercourse
before
and
after
the
cycle
showed
a
significant
decline
(P
less
than
005)
For
each
subject
mean
weekly
rates
of
sexual
intercourse
for
13-wk
periods
over
the
entire
transition
period
were
plotted
and
the
slope
of
the
line
was
calculated
Overall
the
mean
slope
was
negative
as
predicted
and
was
significantly
different
from
zero
(P
less
than
005)
The
questionnaire
data
showed
that
compared
with
their
pre-menopause
data
the
women
had
fewer
sexual
thoughts
or
fantasies
(P
less
than
001)
suffered
more
from
lack
of
vaginal
lubrication
during
sex
(P
less
than
001)
and
were
less
satisfied
with
their
partners
as
lovers
(P
less
than
005)
after
menopause
While
estradiol
(E)
and
testosterone
(T)
levels
showed
significant
declines
(P
less
than
002)
testosterone
showed
the
most
consistent
association
with
coital
frequency
The
findings
generally
supported
our
initial
hypothesis
of
a
decline
in
sexual
interest
and
coital
frequency
after
menopause
