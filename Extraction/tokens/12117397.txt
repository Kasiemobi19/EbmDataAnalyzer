Abstract
Text
Despite
decades
of
accumulated
observational
evidence
the
balance
of
risks
and
benefits
for
hormone
use
in
healthy
postmenopausal
women
remains
uncertain
To
assess
the
major
health
benefits
and
risks
of
the
most
commonly
used
combined
hormone
preparation
in
the
United
States
Estrogen
plus
progestin
component
of
the
Women's
Health
Initiative
a
randomized
controlled
primary
prevention
trial
(planned
duration
85
years)
in
which
16608
postmenopausal
women
aged
50-79
years
with
an
intact
uterus
at
baseline
were
recruited
by
40
US
clinical
centers
in
1993-1998
Participants
received
conjugated
equine
estrogens
0625
mg/d
plus
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
25
mg/d
in
1
tablet
(n
=
8506)
or
placebo
(n
=
8102)
The
primary
outcome
was
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
(nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
and
CHD
death)
with
invasive
breast
cancer
as
the
primary
adverse
outcome
A
global
index
summarizing
the
balance
of
risks
and
benefits
included
the
2
primary
outcomes
plus
stroke
pulmonary
embolism
(PE)
endometrial
cancer
colorectal
cancer
hip
fracture
and
death
due
to
other
causes
On
May
31
2002
after
a
mean
of
52
years
of
follow-up
the
data
and
safety
monitoring
board
recommended
stopping
the
trial
of
estrogen
plus
progestin
vs
placebo
because
the
test
statistic
for
invasive
breast
cancer
exceeded
the
stopping
boundary
for
this
adverse
effect
and
the
global
index
statistic
supported
risks
exceeding
benefits
This
report
includes
data
on
the
major
clinical
outcomes
through
April
30
2002
Estimated
hazard
ratios
(HRs)
(nominal
95%
confidence
intervals
[CIs])
were
as
follows
CHD
129
(102-163)
with
286
cases
breast
cancer
126
(100-159)
with
290
cases
stroke
141
(107-185)
with
212
cases
PE
213
(139-325)
with
101
cases
colorectal
cancer
063
(043-092)
with
112
cases
endometrial
cancer
083
(047-147)
with
47
cases
hip
fracture
066
(045-098)
with
106
cases
and
death
due
to
other
causes
092
(074-114)
with
331
cases
Corresponding
HRs
(nominal
95%
CIs)
for
composite
outcomes
were
122
(109-136)
for
total
cardiovascular
disease
(arterial
and
venous
disease)
103
(090-117)
for
total
cancer
076
(069-085)
for
combined
fractures
098
(082-118)
for
total
mortality
and
115
(103-128)
for
the
global
index
Absolute
excess
risks
per
10
000
person-years
attributable
to
estrogen
plus
progestin
were
7
more
CHD
events
8
more
strokes
8
more
PEs
and
8
more
invasive
breast
cancers
while
absolute
risk
reductions
per
10
000
person-years
were
6
fewer
colorectal
cancers
and
5
fewer
hip
fractures
The
absolute
excess
risk
of
events
included
in
the
global
index
was
19
per
10
000
person-years
Overall
health
risks
exceeded
benefits
from
use
of
combined
estrogen
plus
progestin
for
an
average
52-year
follow-up
among
healthy
postmenopausal
US
women
All-cause
mortality
was
not
affected
during
the
trial
The
risk-benefit
profile
found
in
this
trial
is
not
consistent
with
the
requirements
for
a
viable
intervention
for
primary
prevention
of
chronic
diseases
and
the
results
indicate
that
this
regimen
should
not
be
initiated
or
continued
for
primary
prevention
of
CHD
