Does
full
disclosure
of
medical
errors
affect
malpractice
liability
The
jury
is
still
out
Abstract
Text
Mandatory
disclosure
of
medical
errors
has
been
advocated
to
improve
patient
safety
Many
resist
mandatory
disclosure
policies
because
of
concerns
about
increasing
malpractice
exposure
It
has
been
countered
that
malpractice
liability
actually
decreases
when
there
is
full
disclosure
of
medical
errors
A
comprehensive
literature
search
was
conducted
to
determine
what
is
known
about
the
impact
of
full
disclosure
on
malpractice
liability
Electronic
searches
of
multiple
databases
were
supplemented
with
hand
searches
of
bibliographies
and
communication
with
recognized
experts
in
the
field
Screening
the
titles
abstracts
and
in
many
cases
the
full
articles
from
more
than
an
estimated
5200
citations
resulted
in
identification
of
one
published
study
directly
examining
malpractice
liability
when
a
policy
of
full
disclosure
was
implemented
Despite
extensive
literature
on
the
impact
of
disclosure
on
malpractice
liability
few
well-designed
studies
have
focused
on
the
real-world
impact
on
the
volume
and
cost
of
suits
following
implementation
of
a
full
disclosure
policy
Many
articles
examine
why
patients
sue
their
doctors
suggesting
that
some
lawsuits
may
be
averted
by
disclosure
but
the
articles
do
not
allow
us
to
estimate
the
additional
suits
that
would
be
created
by
disclosure
Additional
studies
addressing
the
effect
of
disclosure
on
malpractice
liability
are
needed
