Over-the-counter
medications
for
acute
cough
in
children

in
ambulatory
settings
Abstract
Text
Acute
cough
due
to
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
(URTI)
is
a
common
symptom
Non-prescription
over-the-counter
(OTC)
medicines
are
frequently
recommended
as
a
first-line
treatment
but
there
is
little
evidence
as
to
whether
these
drugs
are
effective
To
assess
the
effects
of
oral
OTC
cough
preparations
for
acute
cough
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
(The
Cochrane
Library
2006
Issue
4)
MEDLINE
(January
1966
to
January
Week
1
2007)
EMBASE
(January
1974
to
January
2007)
and
the
UK

(June

Randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
comparing
oral
OTC
cough
preparations
with
placebo
in
children
and
adults
suffering
from
acute
cough
in
ambulatory
settings
We
considered
all
cough
outcomes
and
second
outcomes
of
interest
were
adverse
effects
Two
review
authors
independently
screened
potentially
relevant
citations
and
independently
extracted
data
and
assessed
study
quality
Quantitative
analysis
was
performed
where
appropriate
Twenty
five
trials
(17
in
adults
8
in
children)
involving
3492
people
(2876
adults
and
616
children)
were
included
RESULTS
OF
STUDIES
IN
ADULTS
Six
trials
compared
antitussives
with
placebo
and
had
variable
results
Two
trials
compared
the
expectorant
guaifenesin
with
placebo
one
indicated
significant
benefit
whereas
the
other
did
not
One
trial
found
that
a
mucolytic
reduced
cough
frequency
and
symptom
scores
Two
studies
examined
antihistamine-decongestant
combinations
and
found
conflicting
results
Three
studies
compared
other
combinations
of
drugs
with
placebo
and
indicated
some
benefit
in
reducing
cough
symptoms
Three
trials
found
antihistamines
were
no
more
effective
than
placebo
in
relieving
cough
symptoms
RESULTS
OF
STUDIES
IN
CHILDREN
Antitussives
(two
studies)
antihistamines
(two
studies)
antihistamine
decongestants
(two
studies)
and
antitussive/bronchodilator
combinations
(one
study)
were
no
more
effective
than
placebo
No
studies
using
expectorants
met
our
inclusion
criteria
The
results
of
one
trial
favoured
active
treatment
with
mucolytics
over
placebo
One
trial
tested
two
paediatric
cough
syrups
and
both
preparations
showed
a
'satisfactory
response'
in
46%
and
56%
of
children
compared
to
21%
of
children
in
the
placebo
group
There
is
no
good
evidence
for
or
against
the
effectiveness
of
OTC
medicines
in
acute
cough
The
results
of
this
review
have
to
be
interpreted
with
caution
due
differences
in
study
characteristics
and
quality
Studies
often
showed
conflicting
results
with
uncertainty
regarding
clinical
relevance
Higher
quality
evidence
is
needed
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
self-care
treatments
for
acute
cough
