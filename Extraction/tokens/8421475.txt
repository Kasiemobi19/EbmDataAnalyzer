Title
Effect
of
calcium
supplementation
on
bone
loss
in
postmenopausal
women
Abstract
Text
The
use
of
calcium
supplements
slows
bone
loss
in
the
forearm
and
has
a
beneficial
effect
on
the
axial
bone
density
of
women
in
late
menopause
whose
calcium
intake
is
less
than
400
mg
per
day
However
the
effect
of
a
calcium
supplement
of
1000
mg
per
day
on
the
axial
bone
density
of
postmenopausal
women
with
higher
calcium
intakes
is
not
known
We
studied
122
normal
women
at
least
three
years
after
they
had
reached
menopause
who
had
a
mean
dietary
calcium
intake
of
750
mg
per
day
The
women
were
randomly
assigned
to
treatment
with
either
calcium
(1000
mg
per
day)
or
placebo
for
two
years
The
bone
mineral
density
of
the
total
body
lumbar
spine
and
proximal
femur
was
measured
every
six
months
by
dual-energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
Serum
and
urine
indexes
of
calcium
metabolism
were
measured
at
base
line
and
after
3
12
and
24
months
The
mean
(+/-
SE)
rate
of
loss
of
total-body
bone
mineral
density
was
reduced
by
43
percent
in
the
calcium
group
(-00055
+/-
00010
g
per
square
centimeter
per
year)
as
compared
with
the
placebo
group
(-00097
+/-
00010
g
per
square
centimeter
per
year
P
=
0005)
The
rate
of
loss
of
bone
mineral
density
was
reduced
by
35
percent
in
the
legs
(P
=
002)
and
loss
was
eliminated
in
the
trunk
(P
=
004)
Calcium
use
was
of
significant
benefit
in
the
lumbar
spine
(P
=
004)
and
in
Ward's
triangle
the
rate
of
loss
was
reduced
by
67
percent
(P
=
004)
Calcium
supplementation
had
a
similar
effect
whether
dietary
calcium
intake
was
above
or
below
the
mean
value
for
the
group
Serum
parathyroid
hormone
concentrations
tended
to
be
lower
in
the
calcium
group
as
were
urinary
hydroxyproline
excretion
and
serum
alkaline
phosphatase
concentrations
Calcium
supplementation
significantly
slowed
axial
and
appendicular
bone
loss
in
normal
post-menopausal
women
