Incidence
of
cardiac

with
mild
hypokalemia
induced

low-dose
diuretic
therapy
for
hypertension
Abstract
Text
Nineteen
men
with
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
and
without
a
history
of
cardiac
arrhythmias
were
randomized
(double-blind)
into
groups
to
receive
hydrochlorothiazide
(HCTZ)
at
a
dose
of
25
mg/day
HCTZ
at
50
mg/day
or
HCTZ
(25
mg)
plus
triamterene
(50
mg)
for
a
six-month
period
after
a
three-week
(single-blind)
placebo
period
Serum
electrolyte
values
were
determined
at
baseline
and
at
frequent
intervals
thereafter
Twenty-four
hour
ambulatory
electrocardiograms
were
obtained
at
baseline
and
just
before
study
termination
Mild
hypokalemia
(less
than
35
mEq/L)
occurred
in
approximately
half
of
the
patients
and
was
unrelated
to
treatment
group
Serious
arrhythmias
were
infrequent
though
some
patients
had
large
numbers
of
extra
beats
The
incidence
of
arrhythmia
appeared
unrelated
to
serum
potassium
concentration
We
conclude
that
mild
hypokalemia
associated
with
low-dose
diuretic
therapy
for
hypertension
is
not
arrhythmogenic
