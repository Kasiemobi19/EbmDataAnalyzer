Abstract
Text
Atrial
fibrillation
in
the
absence
of
rheumatic
valvular
disease
is
associated
with
a
fivefold
to
sevenfold
increased
risk
of
ischemic
stroke
The
Stroke
Prevention
in
Atrial
Fibrillation
Study
a
multicenter
randomized
trial
compared
325
mg/day
aspirin
(double-blind)
or
warfarin
with
placebo
for
prevention
of
ischemic
stroke
and
systemic
embolism
(primary
events)
and
included
1330
inpatients
and
outpatients
with
constant
or
intermittent
atrial
fibrillation
During
a
mean
follow-up
of
13
years
the
rate
of
primary
events
in
patients
assigned
to
placebo
was
63%
per
year
and
was
reduced
by
42%
in
those
assigned
to
aspirin
(36%
per
year
p
=
002
95%
confidence
interval
9-63%)
In
the
subgroup
of
warfarin-eligible
patients
(most
less
than
76
years
old)
warfarin
dose-adjusted
to
prolong
prothrombin
time
to
13-fold
to
18-fold
that
of
control
reduced
the
risk
of
primary
events
by
67%
(warfarin
versus
placebo
23%
versus
74%
per
year
p
=
001
95%
confidence
interval
27-85%)
Primary
events
or
death
were
reduced
58%
(p
=
001)
by
warfarin
and
32%
(p
=
002)
by
aspirin
The
risk
of
significant
bleeding
was
15%
14%
and
16%
per
year
in
patients
assigned
to
warfarin
aspirin
and
placebo
respectively
Aspirin
and
warfarin
are
both
effective
in
reducing
ischemic
stroke
and
systemic
embolism
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
Because
warfarin-eligible
patients
composed
a
subset
of
all
aspirin-eligible
patients
the
magnitude
of
reduction
in
events
by
warfarin
versus
aspirin
cannot
be
compared
Too
few
events
occurred
in
warfarin-eligible
patients
to
directly
assess
the
relative
benefit
of
aspirin
compared
with
warfarin
and
the
trial
is
continuing
to
address
this
issue
Patients
with
nonrheumatic
atrial
fibrillation
who
can
safely
take
either
aspirin
or
warfarin
should
receive
prophylactic
antithrombotic
therapy
to
reduce
the
risk
of
stroke
