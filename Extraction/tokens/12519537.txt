Title
Nicotine
replacement
therapy
for
smoking
cessation
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
nicotine
replacement
therapy
(NRT)
is
to
replace
nicotine
from
cigarettes
This
reduces
withdrawal
symptoms
associated
with
smoking
cessation
thus
helping
resist
the
urge
to
smoke
cigarettes
The
aims
of
this
review
were
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
the
different
forms
of
nicotine
replacement
therapy
(chewing
gum
transdermal
patches
nasal
spray
inhalers
and
tablets)
in
achieving
abstinence
from
cigarettes
or
a
sustained
reduction
in
amount
smoked
to
determine
whether
the
effect
is
influenced
by
the
clinical
setting
in
which
the
smoker
is
recruited
and
treated
the
dosage
and
form
of
the
NRT
used
or
the
intensity
of
additional
advice
and
support
offered
to
the
smoker
to
determine
whether
combinations
of
NRT
are
more
effective
than
one
type
alone
and
to
determine
its
effectiveness
compared
to
other
pharmacotherapies
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Tobacco
Addiction
Group
trials
register
in
July
2002
Randomized
trials
in
which
NRT
was
compared
to
placebo
or
no
treatment
or
where
different
doses
of
NRT
were
compared
We
excluded
trials
which
did
not
report
cessation
rates
and
those
with
follow-up
of
less
than
six
months
We
extracted
data
in
duplicate
on
the
type
of
subjects
the
dose
and
duration
and
form
of
nicotine
therapy
the
outcome
measures
method
of
randomization
and
completeness
of
follow-up
The
main
outcome
measure
was
abstinence
from
smoking
after
at
least
six
months
of
follow-up
We
used
the
most
rigorous
definition
of
abstinence
for
each
trial
and
biochemically
validated
rates
if
available
Where
appropriate
we
performed
meta-analysis
using
a
fixed
effects
model
(Peto)
We
identified
110
trials
96
with
a
non
NRT
control
group
The
odds
ratio
for
abstinence
with
NRT
compared
to
control
was
174
(95%
confidence
interval
164
-
186)
The
odds
ratios
for
the
different
forms
of
NRT
were
166
for
gum
174
for
patches
227
for
nasal
spray
208
for
inhaled
nicotine
and
208
for
nicotine
sublingual
tablet/lozenge
These
odds
were
largely
independent
of
the
duration
of
therapy
the
intensity
of
additional
support
provided
or
the
setting
in
which
the
NRT
was
offered
In
highly
dependent
smokers
there
was
a
significant
benefit
of
4
mg
gum
compared
with
2mg
gum
(odds
ratio
267
95%
confidence
interval
169
-
422)
There
was
weak
evidence
that
combinations
of
forms
of
NRT
are
more
effective
Higher
doses
of
nicotine
patch
may
produce
small
increases
in
quit
rates
Only
one
study
directly
compared
NRT
to
another
pharmacotherapy
in
which
bupropion
was
significantly
more
effective
than
nicotine
patch
or
placebo
All
of
the
commercially
available
forms
of
NRT
(nicotine
gum
transdermal
patch
the
nicotine
nasal
spray
nicotine
inhaler
and
nicotine
sublingual
tablets/lozenges)
are
effective
as
part
of
a
strategy
to
promote
smoking
cessation
They
increase
quit
rates
approximately
15
to
2
fold
regardless
of
setting
The
effectiveness
of
NRT
appears
to
be
largely
independent
of
the
intensity
of
additional
support
provided
to
the
smoker
Provision
of
more
intense
levels
of
support
although
beneficial
in
facilitating
the
likelihood
of
quitting
is
not
essential
to
the
success
of
NRT
There
is
promising
evidence
that
bupropion
may
be
more
effective
than
NRT
(either
alone
or
in
combination)
However
its
most
appropriate
place
in
the
therapeutic
armamentarium
requires
further
study
and
consideration
