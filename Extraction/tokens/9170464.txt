Induction
of
labor
versus
expectant
management
in
macrosomia
a
randomized
study
Abstract
Text
Macrosomia
at
term
is
associated
with
increased
maternal
and
neonatal
morbidity
including
a
higher
rate
of
cesarean
delivery
and
shoulder
dystocia
Induction
of
labor
has
been
suggested
as
a
means
to
prevent
further
weight
gain
and
improve
outcome
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
induction
of
labor
in
these
cases
improves
maternal
and
neonatal
outcome
Patients
at
term
with
an
ultrasonic
fetal
weight
estimation
of
4000-4500
g
were
prospectively
randomized
into
two
groups
induction
of
labor
(group
D
and
expectant
management
(group
II)
Patients
with
diabetes
a
previous
cesarean
delivery
or
nonvertex
presentation
were
excluded
Outcome
variables
included
mode
of
delivery
arterial
cord
pH
presence
of
shoulder
dystocia
brachial
plexus
injury
clavicular
fracture
cephalohematoma
and
intraventricular
hemorrhage
Of
273
patients
who
were
eligible
for
the
study
134
were
randomized
to
group
I
and
139
to
group
II
Parity
gestational
age
and
fetal
weight
estimation
were
similar
in
the
two
groups
The
neonates
of
group
II
patients
were
significantly
heavier
(41328
+/-
3474
versus
40628
+/-
3069
g
P
=
024)
The
rate
of
cesarean
delivery
was
194%
in
group
I
and
216%
in
group
II
patients
(not
significant
[NS])
Cord
pH
was
similar
in
both
groups
Shoulder
dystocia
was
diagnosed
in
five
group
I
and
six
group
II
patients
(NS)
None
developed
brachial
plexus
injury
There
were
two
cases
of
mild
transient
brachial
plexus
injury
in
group
II
patients
without
documented
shoulder
dystocia
Mild
intraventricular
hemorrhage
was
diagnosed
in
three
of
44
group
I
and
two
of
31
group
II
neonates
evaluated
(NS)
In
this
prospective
randomized
study
induction
of
labor
for
suspected
macrosomia
at
term
did
not
decrease
the
rate
of
cesarean
delivery
or
reduce
neonatal
morbidity
Ultrasonic
estimation
of
fetal
weight
between
4000
and
4500
g
should
not
be
considered
an
indication
for
induction
of
labor
