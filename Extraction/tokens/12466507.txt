A
comparison
of
rate
control
and
rhythm
control
in
patients
with
recurrent
persistent
atrial
fibrillation
Abstract
Text
Maintenance
of
sinus
rhythm
is
the
main
therapeutic
goal
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
However
recurrences
of
atrial
fibrillation
and
side
effects
of
antiarrhythmic
drugs
offset
the
benefits
of
sinus
rhythm
We
hypothesized
that
ventricular
rate
control
is
not
inferior
to
the
maintenance
of
sinus
rhythm
for
the
treatment
of
atrial
fibrillation
We
randomly
assigned
522
patients
who
had
persistent
atrial
fibrillation
after
a
previous
electrical
cardioversion
to
receive
treatment
aimed
at
rate
control
or
rhythm
control
Patients
in
the
rate-control
group
received
oral
anticoagulant
drugs
and
rate-slowing
medication
Patients
in
the
rhythm-control
group
underwent
serial
cardioversions
and
received
antiarrhythmic
drugs
and
oral
anticoagulant
drugs
The
end
point
was
a
composite
of
death
from
cardiovascular
causes
heart
failure
thromboembolic
complications
bleeding
implantation
of
a
pacemaker
and
severe
adverse
effects
of
drugs
After
a
mean
(+/-SD)
of
23+/-06
years
39
percent
of
the
266
patients
in
the
rhythm-control
group
had
sinus
rhythm
as
compared
with
10
percent
of
the
256
patients
in
the
rate-control
group
The
primary
end
point
occurred
in
44
patients
(172
percent)
in
the
rate-control
group
and
in
60
(226
percent)
in
the
rhythm-control
group
The
90
percent
(two-sided)
upper
boundary
of
the
absolute
difference
in
the
primary
end
point
was
04
percent
(the
prespecified
criterion
for
noninferiority
was
10
percent
or
less)
The
distribution
of
the
various
components
of
the
primary
end
point
was
similar
in
the
rate-control
and
rhythm-control
groups
Rate
control
is
not
inferior
to
rhythm
control
for
the
prevention
of
death
and
morbidity
from
cardiovascular
causes
and
may
be
appropriate
therapy
in
patients
with
a
recurrence
of
persistent
atrial
fibrillation
after
electrical
cardioversion
