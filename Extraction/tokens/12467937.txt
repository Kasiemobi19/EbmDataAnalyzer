Combination
therapy
for
combined
dyslipidemia
Abstract
Text
Patients
with
combined
dyslipidemia
are
at
high
risk
for
coronary
artery
disease
and
often
require
combination
drug
therapy
to
achieve
lipid
levels
recommended
by
the
US
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program's
third
Adult
Treatment
Panel
(ATP
III)
In
addition
to
recommendations
for
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
and
triglyceride
levels
ATP
III
established
non-high-density
lipoprotein
(HDL)
cholesterol
goals
for
individuals
with
triglycerides
>or=226
mmol/L
(>or=200
mg/dL)
It
also
introduced
certain
criteria
for
the
diagnosis
of
the
metabolic
syndrome
a
clustering
of
risk
factors
(abdominal
obesity
elevated
triglycerides
low
HDL
cholesterol
elevated
blood
pressure
impaired
fasting
glucose)
that
increases
cardiovascular
risk
and
is
common
in
patients
with
combined
dyslipidemia
Statin
monotherapy
has
been
shown
to
benefit
these
patients
and
additional
benefit
may
be
obtained
by
combination
therapy
that
provides
greater
reductions
in
both
LDL
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
as
well
as
greater
increases
in
HDL
cholesterol
However
combining
a
statin
with
either
niacin
or
a
fibrate
may
increase
the
risk
for
myopathy
and
therefore
requires
careful
monitoring
and
evaluation
of
the
risk-benefit
ratio
for
each
patient
Moreover
combination
therapy
may
be
associated
with
increased
drug
costs
and
decreased
patient
compliance
Recently
developed
agents
that
may
improve
the
effectiveness
of
combination
therapy
include
ezetimibe-a
cholesterol
absorption
inhibitor-and
a
formulation
that
combines
extended-release
niacin
and
lovastatin
in
a
single
pill
Clinical
trials
are
needed
to
determine
the
optimal
treatment
in
patients
with
combined
dyslipidemia
