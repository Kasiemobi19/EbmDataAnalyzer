Title
Differences
in
morbidity
between
breast-fed
and
formula-fed
infants
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
breast-feeding
is
protective
against
infection
in
relatively
affluent
populations
morbidity
data
were
collected
by
weekly
monitoring
during
the
first
2
years
of
life
from
matched
cohorts
of
infants
who
were
either
breast
fed
(BF)
(N
=
46)
or
formula
fed
(FF)
(N
=
41)
until
at
least
12
months
of
age
Cohorts
were
matched
for
characteristics
such
as
birth
weight
and
parental
socioeconomic
status
and
we
controlled
for
use
of
day
care
in
data
analysis
Mean
maternal
educational
level
was
high
(16
years)
in
both
groups
In
the
first
year
of
life
the
incidence
of
diarrheal
illness
among
BF
infants
was
half
that
of
FF
infants
the
percentage
with
any
otitis
media
was
19%
lower
and
with
prolonged
episodes
(>
10
days)
was
80%
lower
in
BF
compared
with
FF
infants
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
rates
of
respiratory
illness
nearly
all
cases
were
mild
upper
respiratory
infections
Morbidity
rates
did
not
differ
significantly
between
groups
in
the
second
year
of
life
but
the
mean
duration
of
episodes
of
otitis
media
was
longer
in
FF
than
BF
infants
(88
+/-
53
vs
59
+/-
35
days
respectively
p
=
001)
These
results
indicate
that
the
reduction
in
morbidity
associated
with
breast-feeding
is
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
be
of
public
health
significance
