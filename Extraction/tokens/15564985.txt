Determinants
of
white-coat
hypertension
Abstract
Text
The
prevalence
of
white-coat
hypertension
(WCH)
is
considerable
in
patients
referred
with
elevated
office
blood
pressure
Failure
to
recognise
this
phenomenon
can
lead
to
the
inappropriate
use
of
antihypertensive
medications
We
undertook
this
study
to
determine
the
profile
of
patients
with
WCH
Baseline
clinic
and
daytime
ambulatory
blood
pressures
were
available
from
5716
patients
referred
over
a
22-year
period
Individuals
were
considered
to
have
WCH
if
they
had
an
elevated
clinic
blood
pressure
measurement
greater
than
140/90
mmHg
and
normal
daytime
mean
ambulatory
blood
pressure
Mean
age
was
536
years
and
532%
were
female
The
overall
prevalence
of
white-coat
hypertension
was
154%
A
higher
prevalence
was
seen
amongst
older
adults
females
and
non-smokers
Multivariate
logistic
regression
analysis
confirmed
these
characteristics
as
independent
predictors
of
WCH
