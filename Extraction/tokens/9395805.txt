Thyroid
stimulating
hormone
receptor
antibody
levels
in
Singaporean
patients
with
autoimmune
thyroid
disease
Abstract
Text
Stimulating
thyrotrophin
receptor
antibodies
(TRAbs)
have
been
identified
as
the
antibodies
responsible
for
the
pathogenesis
of
Graves'
disease
(GD)
while
blocking
TRAbs
have
been
implicated
as
the
cause
of
hypothyroidism
in
some
patients
with
chronic
lymphocytic
thyroiditis
(CLT)
TRAb
positivity
in
patients
with
other
thyroid
disorders
such
as
silent
thyroiditis
toxic
multinodular
goitre
and
subacute
thyroiditis
has
been
reported
but
the
role
of
TRAb
in
these
disorders
is
unclear
A
study
was
carried
out
to
determine
the
prevalence
of
TRAb
positivity
in
Singaporean
patients
with
a
spectrum
of
thyroid
diseases
TRAb
levels
were
measured
in
181
patients
with
GD
54
patients
with
CLT
(37
goitrous
and
17
agoitrous)
16
patients
with
thyroid
nodules
11
patients
with
subacute
thyroiditis
1
patient
with
hyperthyroidism
due
to
a
human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
(HCG)-secreting
tumour
2
patients
with
thyroid
stimulating
hormone-secreting
tumours
and
2
patients
with
amiodarone-induced
dysthyroidism
Using
a
cut-off
of
100
U/L
TRAb
levels
were
found
to
be
positive
in
790%
of
GD
patients
92%
of
CLT
patients
(euthyroid
and
hypothyroid)
and
no
patients
with
other
thyroid
disorders
TRAb
was
a
more
sensitive
marker
of
GD
than
anti-thyroglobulin
antibodies
(532%)
but
not
anti-microsomal
(783%)
antibodies
TRAb
levels
>
100
U/L
appear
to
be
highly
specific
for
autoimmune
thyroid
disease
