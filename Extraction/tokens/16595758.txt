overweight

in

United

1999-2004
Abstract
Text
The
prevalence
of
overweight
in
children
and
adolescents
and
obesity
in
adults
in
the
United
States
has
increased
over
several
decades
To
provide
current
estimates
of
the
prevalence
and
trends
of
overweight
in
children
and
adolescents
and
obesity
in
adults
Analysis
of
height
and
weight
measurements
from
3958
children
and
adolescents
aged
2
to
19
years
and
4431
adults
aged
20
years
or
older
obtained
in
2003-2004
as
part
of
the
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
(NHANES)
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
the
US
population
Data
from
the
NHANES
obtained
in
1999-2000
and
in
2001-2002
were
compared
with
data
from
2003-2004
Estimates
of
the
prevalence
of
overweight
in
children
and
adolescents
and
obesity
in
adults
Overweight
among
children
and
adolescents
was
defined
as
at
or
above
the
95th
percentile
of
the
sex-specific
body
mass
index
(BMI)
for
age
growth
charts
Obesity
among
adults
was
defined
as
a
BMI
of
30
or
higher
extreme
obesity
was
defined
as
a
BMI
of
40
or
higher
In
2003-2004
171%
of
US
children
and
adolescents
were
overweight
and
322%
of
adults
were
obese
Tests
for
trend
were
significant
for
male
and
female
children
and
adolescents
indicating
an
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
overweight
in
female
children
and
adolescents
from
138%
in
1999-2000
to
160%
in
2003-2004
and
an
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
overweight
in
male
children
and
adolescents
from
140%
to
182%
Among
men
the
prevalence
of
obesity
increased
significantly
between
1999-2000
(275%)
and
2003-2004
(311%)
Among
women
no
significant
increase
in
obesity
was
observed
between
1999-2000
(334%)
and
2003-2004
(332%)
The
prevalence
of
extreme
obesity
(body
mass
index
>
or
=40)
in
2003-2004
was
28%
in
men
and
69%
in
women
In
2003-2004
significant
differences
in
obesity
prevalence
remained
by
race/ethnicity
and
by
age
Approximately
30%
of
non-Hispanic
white
adults
were
obese
as
were
450%
of
non-Hispanic
black
adults
and
368%
of
Mexican
Americans
Among
adults
aged
20
to
39
years
285%
were
obese
while
368%
of
adults
aged
40
to
59
years
and
310%
of
those
aged
60
years
or
older
were
obese
in
2003-2004
The
prevalence
of
overweight
among
children
and
adolescents
and
obesity
among
men
increased
significantly
during
the
6-year
period
from
1999
to
2004
among
women
no
overall
increases
in
the
prevalence
of
obesity
were
observed
These
estimates
were
based
on
a
6-year
period
and
suggest
that
the
increases
in
body
weight
are
continuing
in
men
and
in
children
and
adolescents
while
they
may
be
leveling
off
in
women
