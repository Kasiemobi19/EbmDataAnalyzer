Abstract
Text
Osteoporosis
is
a
common
complication
of
long-term
glucocorticoid
therapy
for
which
there
is
no
well-proved
preventive
or
restorative
treatment
We
carried
out
two
48-week
randomized
placebo-controlled
studies
of
two
doses
of
alendronate
in
477
men
and
women
17
to
83
years
of
age
who
were
receiving
glucocorticoid
therapy
The
primary
end
point
was
the
difference
in
the
mean
percent
change
in
lumbar-spine
bone
density
from
base
line
to
week
48
between
the
groups
Secondary
outcomes
included
changes
in
bone
density
of
the
hip
biochemical
markers
of
bone
turnover
and
the
incidence
of
new
vertebral
fractures
The
mean
(+/-SE)
bone
density
of
the
lumbar
spine
increased
by
21+/-03
percent
and
29+/-03
percent
respectively
in
the
groups
that
received
5
and
10
mg
of
alendronate
per
day
(P<0001)
and
decreased
by
04+/-03
percent
in
the
placebo
group
The
femoral-neck
bone
density
increased
by
12+/-04
percent
and
10+/-04
percent
in
the
respective
alendronate
groups
(P<001)
and
decreased
by
12+/-04
percent
in
the
placebo
group
(P<001)
The
bone
density
of
the
trochanter
and
total
body
also
increased
significantly
in
the
patients
treated
with
alendronate
There
were
proportionally
fewer
new
vertebral
fractures
in
the
alendronate
groups
(overall
incidence
23
percent)
than
in
the
placebo
group
(37
percent)
(relative
risk
06
95
percent
confidence
interval
01
to
44)
Markers
of
bone
turnover
decreased
significantly
in
the
alendronate
groups
(P<0001)
There
were
no
differences
in
serious
adverse
effects
among
the
three
groups
but
there
was
a
small
increase
in
nonserious
upper
gastrointestinal
effects
in
the
group
receiving
10
mg
of
alendronate
Alendronate
increases
bone
density
in
patients
receiving
glucocorticoid
therapy
