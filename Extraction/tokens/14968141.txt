Abstract
Text
To
provide
updated
evidence-based
recommendations
for
the
assessment
of
the
diagnosis
cardiovascular
risk
and
identifiable
causes
for
adults
with
high
blood
pressure
For
persons
in
whom
a
high
blood
pressure
value
is
recorded
the
assignment
of
a
diagnosis
of
hypertension
is
dependent
on
the
appropriate
measurement
of
blood
pressure
the
level
of
the
blood
pressure
elevation
and
the
duration
of
follow-up
In
addition
the
presence
of
concomitant
vascular
risk
factors
target
organ
damage
and
established
atherosclerotic
diseases
should
be
assessed
to
determine
the
urgency
intensity
and
type
of
treatment
For
persons
diagnosed
as
having
hypertension
defining
overall
risk
of
adverse
cardiovascular
outcomes
requires
an
assessment
of
concomitant
vascular
risk
factors
including
laboratory
testing
a
search
for
target
organ
damage
and
an
assessment
for
modifiable
causes
of
hypertension
Home
and
ambulatory
blood
pressure
assessment
and
echocardiography
are
options
for
selected
patients
The
identification
of
persons
at
increased
risk
of
adverse
cardiovascular
outcomes
the
quantification
of
overall
cardiovascular
risk
and
the
identification
of
persons
with
potentially
modifiable
causes
of
hypertension
Medline
searches
were
conducted
from
November
2001
one
year
before
the
period
of
the
last
revision
of
the
Canadian
recommendations
for
the
management
of
hypertension
to
October
2003
Reference
lists
were
scanned
experts
were
polled
and
the
personal
files
of
subgroup
members
and
authors
were
used
to
identify
other
studies
Identified
articles
were
reviewed
and
appraised
using
prespecified
levels
of
evidence
by
content
experts
and
methodological
experts
A
high
value
was
placed
on
the
identification
of
persons
at
increased
risk
of
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
and
persons
with
identifiable
and
potentially
modifiable
causes
of
hypertension
The
identification
of
persons
at
higher
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
will
permit
counselling
for
lifestyle
maneuvers
and
introduction
of
antihypertensive
drugs
to
reduce
blood
pressure
for
patients
with
sustained
hypertension
The
identification
of
specific
causes
of
hypertension
may
permit
the
use
of
cause-specific
interventions
For
certain
subgroups
of
patients
and
specific
classes
of
drugs
blood
pressure
lowering
has
been
associated
with
reduced
cardiovascular
morbidity
and/or
mortality
The
document
contains
recommendations
for
blood
pressure
measurement
diagnosis
of
hypertension
and
assessment
of
cardiovascular
risk
for
adults
with
high
blood
pressure
These
include
the
accurate
measurement
of
blood
pressure
criteria
for
diagnosis
of
hypertension
and
recommendations
for
follow-up
assessment
of
overall
cardiovascular
risk
routine
and
optional
laboratory
testing
assessment
for
renovascular
and
endocrine
causes
home
and
ambulatory
blood
pressure
monitoring
and
the
role
of
echocardiography
for
those
with
hypertension
All
recommendations
were
graded
according
to
strength
of
evidence
and
voted
on
by
the
Canadian
Hypertension
Education
Program
Evidence-Based
Recommendations
Task
Force
Only
the
recommendations
that
achieved
high
levels
of
consensus
are
reported
These
guidelines
will
be
updated
annually
