Cognitive-behavioral
therapy
imipramine
or
their
combination
for
panic
disorder
A
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Panic
disorder
(PD)
may
be
treated
with
drugs
psychosocial
intervention
or
both
but
the
relative
and
combined
efficacies
have
not
been
evaluated
in
an
unbiased
fashion
To
evaluate
whether
drug
and
psychosocial
therapies
for
PD
are
each
more
effective
than
placebo
whether
one
treatment
is
more
effective
than
the
other
and
whether
combined
therapy
is
more
effective
than
either
therapy
alone
Randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
clinical
trial
conducted
in
4
anxiety
research
clinics
from
May
1991
to
April
1998
A
total
of
312
patients
with
PD
were
included
in
the
analysis
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
imipramine
up
to
300
mg/d
only
(n=83)
cognitive-behavioral
therapy
(CBT)
only
(n=77)
placebo
only
(n=24)
CBT
plus
imipramine
(n=65)
or
CBT
plus
placebo
(n=63)
Patients
were
treated
weekly
for
3
months
(acute
phase)
responders
were
then
seen
monthly
for
6
months
(maintenance
phase)
and
then
followed
up
for
6
months
after
treatment
discontinuation
Treatment
response
based
on
the
Panic
Disorder
Severity
Scale
(PDSS)
and
the
Clinical
Global
Impression
Scale
(CGI)
by
treatment
group
Both
imipramine
and
CBT
were
significantly
superior
to
placebo
for
the
acute
treatment
phase
as
assessed
by
the
PDSS
(response
rates
for
the
intent-to-treat
[ITT]
analysis
458%
487%
and
217%
P=05
and
P=03
respectively)
but
were
not
significantly
different
for
the
CGI
(48
2%
539%
and
375%
respectively)
After
6
months
of
maintenance
imipramine
and
CBT
were
significantly
more
effective
than
placebo
for
both
the
PDSS
(response
rates
378%
395%
and
130%
respectively
P=02
for
both)
and
the
CGI
(378%
421%
and
130%
respectively)
Among
responders
imipramine
produced
a
response
of
higher
quality
The
acute
response
rate
for
the
combined
treatment
was
603%
for
the
PDSS
and
641%
for
the
CGI
neither
was
significantly
different
from
the
other
groups
The
6-month
maintenance
response
rate
for
combined
therapy
was
571%
for
the
PDSS
(P=04
vs
CBT
alone
and
P=03
vs
imipramine
alone)
and
563%
for
the
CGI
(P=03
vs
imipramine
alone)
but
not
significantly
better
than
CBT
plus
placebo
in
either
analysis
Six
months
after
treatment
discontinuation
in
the
ITT
analysis
CGI
response
rates
were
410%
for
CBT
plus
placebo
319%
for
CBT
alone
197%
for
imipramine
alone
13%
for
placebo
and
263%
for
CBT
combined
with
imipramine
Combining
imipramine
and
CBT
appeared
to
confer
limited
advantage
acutely
but
more
substantial
advantage
by
the
end
of
maintenance
Each
treatment
worked
well
immediately
following
treatment
and
during
maintenance
CBT
appeared
durable
in
follow-up
