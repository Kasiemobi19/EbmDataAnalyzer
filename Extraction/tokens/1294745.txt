Treatment
of
knee
osteoarthritis
relationship
of
clinical
features
of
joint
inflammation
to
the
response
to
a
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drug
or
pure
analgesic
Abstract
Text
Our
randomized
double
blinded
comparison
of
acetaminophen
versus
analgesic
and
antiinflammatory
doses
of
ibuprofen
in
the
treatment
of
182
subjects
with
knee
osteoarthritis
(OA)
systematically
evaluated
soft
tissue
tenderness
and
joint
swelling
Improvement
in
these
signs
of
joint
inflammation
was
associated
with
lessening
of
disability
(p
=
002)
and
reduction
in
rest
pain
(p
=
007)
but
not
with
the
drug
treatment
regimen
Thus
joint
tenderness
and
swelling
presumptive
evidence
of
synovitis
may
not
be
a
priori
indications
for
use
of
an
antiinflammatory
drug
or
predict
greater
responsiveness
to
treatment
with
an
antiinflammatory
drug
than
to
a
pure
analgesic
in
symptomatic
treatment
of
patients
with
knee
OA
