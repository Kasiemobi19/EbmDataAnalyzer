cooling
method
in

treatment
of
ankle
sprains
Abstract
Text
Cooling
treatment
with
'Cryogel'
is
compared
with
the
use
of
crepe
bandaging
in
patients
with
recent
ankle
sprains
All
patients
were
followed
up
regularly
and
the
results
appears
to
favour
cooling
when
it
is
used
in
the
early
period
of
treatment
Cooling
reduced
oedema
pain
and
disability
and
shortened
the
recovery
period
