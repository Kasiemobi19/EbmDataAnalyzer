Cardiovascular
effects
of
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
with
pioglitazone
metformin
and
gliclazide
Abstract
Text
Cardiovascular
mortality
and
morbidity
are
increased
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
However
there
are
few
data
from
clinical
trials
comparing
cardiovascular
effects
of
alternative
oral
anti-diabetic
agents
Major
cardiovascular
outcomes
during
four
one-year
double-blind
trials
in
over
3700
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
randomised
to
either
a
thiazolidinedione
pioglitazone
metformin
or
a
sulphonylurea
gliclazide
treatment
have
been
combined
Mean
blood
pressure
was
slightly
reduced
by
all
treatments
with
pioglitazone
treatment
resulting
in
the
largest
falls
(approximately
15
mmHg)
Hospitalisations
for
cardiac
or
cerebrovascular
events
were
similar
with
the
different
treatments
Overall
mortality
was
seven
of
1857
for
pioglitazone
and
10
of
1856
for
non-pioglitazone
treatments
of
which
three
and
six
were
cardiac
deaths
respectively
The
incidence
of
congestive
cardiac
failure
was
similar
with
pioglitazone
(12/1857)
and
non-pioglitazone
(10/1856)
treatments
The
results
show
similar
cardiovascular
outcome
for
the
three
different
treatments
over
a
one-year
period
but
demonstrate
interesting
differences
which
will
require
longer-term
formal
outcome
studies
to
determine
their
significance
