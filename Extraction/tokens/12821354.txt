ThinPrep
liquid-based

quantitative
survey
Abstract
Text
The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
ThinPrep
a
liquid-based
cytology
preparation
technique
in
comparison
with
conventionally
prepared
Papanicolaou
smears
in
detecting
cervical
pathology
Forty-seven
English-language
articles
published
between
January
1990
and
September
2002
were
identified
through
Medline
and
manual
searches
After
elimination
of
5
nonprimary
articles
10
unpaired
studies
5
descriptive
articles
with
insufficient
or
no
data
and
3
articles
with
data
that
could
not
be
recast
into
a
consistent
format
there
remained
24
usable
articles
Seventeen
articles
contained
data
comparing
ThinPrep
with
conventional
cytology
for
35172
patients
and
10
articles
compared
cytology
with
histology
or
other
gold
standard
diagnoses
for
21752
patients
Three
of
these
articles
contained
both
types
of
comparisons
The
standard
cytology
classification
into
negative
atypical
low-grade
(LGSIL)
and
high-grade
(HGSIL)
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
and
carcinoma
was
applied
other
categorization
schemes
were
recoded
as
necessary
Concordance
estimates
based
on
five-way
and
dichotomous
(normal/abnormal)
classifications
were
obtained
from
the
17
studies
containing
paired
cytology
data
Sensitivity
and
specificity
rates
were
obtained
from
the
10
studies
with
paired
cytology
and
histology
data
The
two
methods
tend
to
agree
in
89
and
92%
of
cases
based
on
the
five-level
and
dichotomous
classifications
respectively
ThinPrep
was
reported
as
normal
in
935%
of
cases
of
normal
conventional
smears
The
remaining
65%
of
ThinPrep
slides
were
classified
as
follows
atypical
455%
LGSIL
156%
HGSIL
036%
invasive
cancer
0007%
Sensitivity
rates
relative
to
histology
were
68%
(conventional)
and
76%
(ThinPrep)
and
specificity
rates
were
79%
(conventional)
and
86%
(ThinPrep)
ThinPrep
tends
to
be
more
sensitive
and
specific
than
conventional
smears
in
detecting
cervical
dysplasia
The
increased
sensitivity
of
ThinPrep
results
in
increased
cytologic
diagnosis
of
cervical
atypia
LGSIL
HGSIL
and
invasive
cervical
carcinoma
