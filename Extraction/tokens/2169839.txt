symptomatic

a
comparative

high-fibre
diet
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
efficacy
and
tolerance
of
lactulose
(Duphalac)
and
high-fibre
diet
in
the
treatment
of
symptomatic
diverticular
disease
Prospectively
randomised
parallel
groups
study
over
12
weeks
Patients
were
seen
by
their
clinician
for
an
initial
assessment
and
then
at
weeks
4
8
and
12

Hospital
out-patients
in
the
United
Kingdom
Forty-three
patients
with
a
confirmed
diagnosis
of
diverticular
disease
were
entered
into
the
study
Patients
were
prospectively
randomised
to
receive
lactulose
(15
ml
bd)
or
high-fibre
diet
(30-40
g
daily)
for
12
weeks
Data
were
collected
using
diary
cards
and
physicians'
assessments
Bowel
frequency
and
stool
consistency
improved
similarly
with
both
treatments
Pain
on
bowel
movement
improved
with
both
treatments
in
respect
of
frequency
(lactulose
P
=
0017
fibre
P
=
0084)
and
severity
(lactulose
P
=
0028
fibre
P
=
0043)
Abdominal
pain
also
improved
with
both
treatments
in
respect
of
frequency
(lactulose
P
=
00015
fibre
P
=
0022)
and
severity
(lactulose
P
=
0009
fibre
P
=
0028)
Nine
patients
on
lactulose
and
12
on
fibre
reported
treatment-emergent
symptoms
of
which
none
was
serious
Lactulose
and
high-fibre
diet
were
both
shown
to
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
diverticular
disease
with
some
differences
in
favour
of
lactulose
