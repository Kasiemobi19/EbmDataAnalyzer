The
role
of
intervention
in
established
allergy
avoidance
of
indoor
allergens
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
allergic
disease
Abstract
Text
Avoidance
of
exposure
to
indoor
allergens
is
an
important
element
in
the
treatment
of
allergic
disease
The
results
of
several
studies
provide
strong
evidence
in
support
of
a
role
for
allergen
avoidance
however
strategies
that
optimize
allergen
reduction
in
houses
have
not
been
determined
Complex
issues
regarding
the
efficacy
of
physical
and
chemical
measures
that
target
house
dust
mite
pet
and
cockroach
allergens
in
the
home
are
discussed
The
greatest
challenge
is
to
educate
allergic
patients
so
that
they
can
play
an
important
role
in
controlling
their
own
disease
