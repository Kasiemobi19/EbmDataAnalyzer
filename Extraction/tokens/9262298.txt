Low-dose

in

in
women

unexplained

recurrent

effect
on
prostacyclin
and

production
Abstract
Text
Early
pregnancies
in
women
with
a
history
of
recurrent
spontaneous
abortion
(RSA)
are
accompanied
by
a
deficiency
in
vasodilatory
and
anti-aggregatory
prostacyclin
(PGI2)
and/or
overproduction
of
its
endogenous
antagonist
thromboxane
A2
(TXA2)
We
evaluated
the
effect
of
a
low-dose
aspirin
(LDA)
on
PGI2
and
TXA2
production
and
on
pregnancy
outcome
in
RSA
women
with
and
without
detectable
anticardiolipin
antibodies
(ACA)
Of
82
RSA
women
studied
66
became
pregnant
and
of
them
33
(six
with
elevated
and
27
with
normal
ACA
concentrations)
were
randomized
to
receive
LDA
(50
mg/day)
and
33
(six
with
elevated
and
27
with
normal
ACA
concentrations)
to
receive
placebo
(PLA)
from
a
mean
of
66
days
after
the
missed
period
to
delivery
Treatment
with
LDA
inhibited
platelet
TXA2
production
similarly
in
RSA
women
with
and
without
detectable
ACA
and
with
continuing
pregnancies
(70

07

group
versus
2545
+/-

or
miscarrying
pregnancies
(138
+/-
38
ng/ml
compared
with
2336
+/-
598
ng/ml
P
<
00001
respectively)
Furthermore
LDA
decreased
urinary
excretion
of
the
TXA2
metabolite
(23-dinor-TXB2)
both
in
pregnancies
which
went
to
term
(61

ng/mmol
creatinine
LDA
group
versus
193
+/-
30
ng/mmol

PLA
group
P

or
again
ended
in
miscarriage
(47
+/-
08
ng/mmol
creatinine
versus
173
+/-
44
ng/mmol
creatinine
P
<
00001
respectively)
but
did
not
affect
the
excretion
of
the
prostacyclin
metabolite
(23-dinor-6-keto-PGF1alpha)
Early
pregnancy
ultrasound
examination
revealed
a
living
fetus
in
58
women
Of
these
seven
in
the
LDA
group
(233%
four
with
elevated
and
three
with
normal
ACA
concentrations)
and
five
in
the
PLA
group
(179%
two
with
elevated
and
three
with
normal
ACA
concentrations
not
significant)
experienced
a
miscarriage
All
infants
were
healthy
and
the
frequency
of
growth
retardation
was
similar
in
both
groups
(130%)
One
woman
in
the
LDA
group
(43%)
and
three
women
receiving
PLA
(130%)
developed
pre-eclampsia
(not
significant)
Therefore
although
treatment
with
LDA
caused
a
desirable
biochemical
effect
it
did
not
improve
pregnancy
outcome
in
RSA
women
with
or
without
detectable
ACA
