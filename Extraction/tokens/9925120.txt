Title
Cholesterol-lowering
effects
of
dietary
fiber
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
The
effects
of
dietary
soluble
fibers
on
blood
cholesterol
are
uncertain
This
meta-analysis
of
67
controlled
trials
was
performed
to
quantify
the
cholesterol-lowering
effect
of
major
dietary
fibers
Least-squares
regression
analyses
were
used
to
test
the
effect
on
blood
lipids
of
pectin
oat
bran
guar
gum
and
psyllium
Independent
variables
were
type
and
amount
of
soluble
fiber
initial
cholesterol
concentration
and
other
important
study
characteristics
Soluble
fiber
2-10
g/d
was
associated
with
small
but
significant
decreases
in
total
cholesterol
[-0045
mmol
L(-1)g
soluble
fiber(-1)
(95%
CI
-0054
-0035)]
and
LDL
cholesterol
[-0057
mmolL(-1)g(-1)
(95%
CI
-0070
-0044)]
The
effects
on
plasma
lipids
of
soluble
fiber
from
oat
psyllium
or
pectin
were
not
significantly
different
We
were
unable
to
compare
effects
of
guar
because
of
the
limited
number
of
studies
using
2-10
g/d
Triacylglycerols
and
HDL
cholesterol
were
not
significantly
influenced
by
soluble
fiber
Lipid
changes
were
independent
of
study
design
treatment
length
and
background
dietary
fat
content
Various
soluble
fibers
reduce
total
and
LDL
cholesterol
by
similar
amounts
The
effect
is
small
within
the
practical
range
of
intake
For
example
3
g
soluble
fiber
from
oats
(3
servings
of
oatmeal
28
g
each)
can
decrease
total
and
LDL
cholesterol
by
approximately
013
mmol/L
Increasing
soluble
fiber
can
make
only
a
small
contribution
to
dietary
therapy
to
lower
cholesterol
