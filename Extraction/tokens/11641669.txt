A
randomized
controlled
trial
comparing
oxytocin
administration
before
and
after
placental
delivery
in
the
prevention
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
Abstract
Text
To
determine
if
the
timing
of
the
administration
of
prophylactic
oxytocin
influences
the
incidence
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
caused
by
uterine
atony
retained
placenta
and
third-stage
duration
Parturients
who
presented
for
vaginal
delivery
were
randomized
in
a
double-blinded
fashion
to
receive
oxytocin
20
units
in
a
500-mL
crystalloid
intravenous
bolus
beginning
upon
delivery
of
either
the
fetal
anterior
shoulder
or
placenta
For
all
patients
the
third
stage
of
labor
was
managed
with
controlled
cord
traction
until
placental
expulsion
followed
by
at
least
15
seconds
of
fundal
massage
Patients
were
excluded
if
they
had
a
previous
cesarean
section
multiple
gestation
antepartum
hemorrhage
or
bleeding
disorder
A
total
of
1486
patients
were
enrolled
745
in
the
before-placenta
group
and
741
in
the
after-placenta
group
The
groups
were
similar
with
respect
to
gestational
age
fetal
weight
labor
duration
maternal
age
parity
and
ethnicity
The
incidence
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
two
groups
(54%
vs
58%
crude
OR
092
95%
CI
059
to
143)
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
two
groups
with
respect
to
incidence
of
retained
placenta
(24%
vs
16%
OR
149
95%
CI
072
to
308)
or
third-stage
duration
(77
minutes
vs
81
minutes
P
=23)
The
administration
of
prophylactic
oxytocin
before
placental
delivery
does
not
reduce
the
incidence
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
or
third-stage
duration
when
compared
with
giving
oxytocin
after
placental
delivery
Early
administration
however
does
not
increase
the
incidence
of
retained
placenta
