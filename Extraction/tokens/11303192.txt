Title
Clinical
predictors
of
endometritis
in
women
with
symptoms
and
signs
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
Abstract
Text
Careful
detection
and
treatment
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
are
essential
for
the
prevention
of
adverse
sequelae
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
diagnostic
test
characteristics
of
clinical
criteria
for
the
diagnosis
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
We
performed
a
cross-sectional
analysis
of
the
baseline
characteristics
of
651
patients
enrolled
in
a
multicenter
randomized
treatment
trial
for
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
Clinical
and
laboratory
findings
were
recorded
for
all
patients
and
endometrial
sampling
was
performed
We
calculated
sensitivity
and
specificity
and
performed
receiver
operating
characteristic
curve
analysis
and
multivariate
logistic
regression
using
histologic
endometritis
as
the
criterion
standard
The
minimal
criteria
for
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
as
recommended
by
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
had
a
sensitivity
of
83%
in
comparison
with
a
95%
sensitivity
for
adnexal
tenderness
(P
=001)
Of
the
supportive
clinical
criteria
the
finding
most
highly
associated
with
endometritis
was
a
positive
test
result
for
Chlamydia
trachomatis
or
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
(adjusted
odds
ratio
43
95%
confidence
interval
289--663)
A
multivariate
logistic
regression
model
indicated
that
combinations
of
criteria
significantly
improve
the
prediction
of
endometritis
Sensitivity
can
be
maximized
by
using
the
presence
of
adnexal
tenderness
as
a
minimal
criterion
for
the
diagnosis
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
and
supportive
criteria
are
helpful
in
estimating
the
probability
of
endometritis
