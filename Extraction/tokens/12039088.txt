Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
sonohysterography
(SHG)
for
the
diagnosis
of
intrauterine
abnormalities
and
describe
complications
and
failure
rate
A
prospective
survey
on
81
patients
(44
patients
with
menometrorrhagia
30
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
and
7
with
infertility)
was
conducted
Histopathology
and
clinical
survey
if
sonohysterography
was
normal
were
the
gold
standards
Pathology
has
been
performed
in
55
cases
There
were
four
failures
(cervical
stenosis)
one
severe
complication
(endometritis)
one
pelvic
pain
Sensitivity
and
specificity
of
sonography
were
56
and
83%
for
sonohysterography
88
and
98%
and
for
hysteroscopy
78
and
97%
Sonohysterography
was
accurate
for
the
diagnosis
of
the
submucous
myoma
component
Sonohysterography
is
available
in
uterine
pathology
easy
safe
and
cheap
but
sonographists
and
patients
should
be
informed
of
the
little
risks
of
such
examination
technique
