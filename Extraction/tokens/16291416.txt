Abstract
Text
Few
large
randomized
controlled
trials
have
assessed
the
value
of
adding
insulin
to
an
oral
antidiabetic
drug
regimen
This
trial
compared
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
biphasic
insulin
aspart
30/70
(BIAsp
30)
plus
pioglitazone
(n
=
93)
glibenclamide
(glyburide)
plus
pioglitazone
(n
=
91)
or
BIAsp
30
monotherapy
(n
=
97)
This
18-week
multinational
multicenter
randomized
open-label
parallel-group
trial
involved
281
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
(60%
male
mean
age
56
years
mean
body
mass
index
295
kg/m2)
with
inadequate
glycemic
control
(mean
glycosylated
hemoglobin
[HbA(1c)]
95%
range
74%-147%)
on
glibenclamide
monotherapy
or
combination
therapy
The
primary
objective
was
to
compare
end-of-trial
HbA(1c)
among
the
3
treatment
groups
Fasting
and
mean
7-
and
8-point
blood
glucose
profiles
blood
lipid
levels
plasminogen
activator
inhibitor
levels
adverse
events
and
hypoglycemia
frequency
were
also
compared
Patients
using
BIAsp
30
(alone
or
with
pioglitazone)
were
injected
twice
daily
(immediately
before
breakfast
and
dinner)
Pioglitazone
(30
mg/d)
and
glibenclamide
(5-15
mg/d)
were
taken
orally
once
daily
with
or
immediately
after
breakfast
At
the
end
of
the
trial
HbA(1c)
was
significantly
lower
for
the
BIAsp
30
plus
pioglitazone
group
than
for
the
glibenclamide
plus
pioglitazone
group
(mean
[SD]
-064%
[023%]
P
=
0005)
and
the
BIAsp
30
monotherapy
group
(-060%
[022%]
P
=
0008)
Mean
(SD)
fasting
blood
glucose
(before
breakfast)
was
significantly
lower
for
BIAsp
30
plus
pioglitazone
than
for
glibenclamide
plus
pioglitazone
(153
[45]
mg/dL
vs
169
[65]
mg/dL
respectively
P
=
0012)
Each
time
point
on
the
8-point
blood
glucose
profile
was
lower
for
BIAsp
30
plus
pioglitazone
than
for
glibenclamide
plus
pioglitazone
(P
<
0001
to
P
<
005)
No
major
hypoglycemic
episodes
were
reported
and
the
absolute
rate
of
hypoglycemic
events
was
low
(<1
event/patient-week)
in
the
BIAsp-only
group
Edema
was
reported
in
<
or
=9%
of
patients
in
each
treatment
group
but
no
occurrence
was
classified
as
serious
Weight
gain
(mean
40
kg)
was
more
common
in
the
BIAsp
plus
pioglitazone
group
(8%)
however
this
was
consistent
with
improved
glycemic
control
and
is
similar
to
that
reported
in
other
pioglitazone
trials
BIAsp
30
plus
pioglitazone
provided
an
efficacious
and
well-tolerated
treatment
alternative
to
glibenclamide
plus
pioglitazone
or
BIAsp
30
alone
in
this
population
of
patients
who
previously
were
not
well
controlled
on
glibenclamide
monotherapy
or
combination
therapy
