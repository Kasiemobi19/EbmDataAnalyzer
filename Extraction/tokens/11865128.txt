Treatment
of
ADHD
in
children
with
tics
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
The
treatment
of
children
with
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
and
Tourette
syndrome
(TS)
has
been
problematic
because
methylphenidate
(MPH)--the
most
commonly
used
drug
to
treat
ADHD--has
been
reported
to
worsen
tics
and
because
clonidine
(CLON)--the
most
commonly
prescribed
alternative--has
unproven
efficacy
The
authors
conducted
a
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
clinical
trial
in
which
136
children
with
ADHD
and
a
chronic
tic
disorder
were
randomly
administered
CLON
alone
MPH
alone
combined
CLON
+
MPH
or
placebo
(2
x
2
factorial
design)
Each
subject
participated
for
16
weeks
(weeks
1-4
CLON/placebo
dose
titration
weeks
5-8
added
MPH/placebo
dose
titration
weeks
9-16
maintenance
therapy)
Thirty-seven
children
were
administered
MPH
alone
34
were
administered
CLON
alone
33
were
administered
CLON
+
MPH
and
32
were
administered
placebo
For
our
primary
outcome
measure
of
ADHD
(Conners
Abbreviated
Symptom
Questionnaire--Teacher)
significant
improvement
occurred
for
subjects
assigned
to
CLON
(p
<
0002)
and
those
assigned
to
MPH
(p
<
0003)
Compared
with
placebo
the
greatest
benefit
occurred
with
combined
CLON
+
MPH
(p
<
00001)
CLON
appeared
to
be
most
helpful
for
impulsivity
and
hyperactivity
MPH
appeared
to
be
most
helpful
for
inattention
The
proportion
of
individual
subjects
reporting
a
worsening
of
tics
as
an
adverse
effect
was
no
higher
in
those
treated
with
MPH
(20%)
than
those
being
administered
CLON
alone
(26%)
or
placebo
(22%)
Compared
with
placebo
measured
tic
severity
lessened
in
all
active
treatment
groups
in
the
following
order
CLON
+
MPH
CLON
alone
MPH
alone
Sedation
was
common
with
CLON
treatment
(28%
reported
moderate
or
severe
sedation)
but
otherwise
the
drugs
were
tolerated
well
including
absence
of
any
evident
cardiac
toxicity
Methylphenidate
and
clonidine
(particularly
in
combination)
are
effective
for
ADHD
in
children
with
comorbid
tics
Prior
recommendations
to
avoid
methylphenidate
in
these
children
because
of
concerns
of
worsening
tics
are
unsupported
by
this
trial
