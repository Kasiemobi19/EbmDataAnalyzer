Title
Shock

for
lateral
elbow
pain
Abstract
Text
This
review
is
one
in
a
series
of
reviews
of
interventions
for
lateral
elbow
pain
To
determine
the
effectiveness
and
safety
of
extracorporeal
shock
wave
therapy
(ESWT)
for
lateral
elbow
pain

MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
and
Science
Citation
Index
(SCISEARCH)
were
conducted
in
February
2005
unrestricted
by
date
We
included
nine
trials
that
randomised
1006
participants
to
ESWT
or
placebo
and
one
trial
that
randomised
93
participants
to
ESWT
or
steroid
injection
For
each
trial
two
independent
reviewers
assessed
the
methodological
quality
and
extracted
data
Methodological
quality
criteria
included
appropriate
randomisation
allocation
concealment
blinding
number
lost
to
follow
up
and
intention
to
treat
analysis
Where
appropriate
pooled
analyses
were
performed
If
there
was
significant
heterogeneity
between
studies
or
the
data
reported
did
not
allow
statistical
pooling
individual
trial
results
were
described
in
the
text
Eleven
of
the
13
pooled
analyses
found
no
significant
benefit
of
ESWT
over
placebo
For
example
the
weighted
mean
difference
for
improvement
in
pain
(on
a
100-point
scale)
from
baseline
to
4-6
weeks
from
a
pooled
analysis
of
three
trials
(446
participants)
was
-942
(95%
CI
-2070
to
186)
and
the
weighted
mean
difference
for
improvement
in
pain
(on
a
100-point
scale)
provoked
by
resisted
wrist
extension
(Thomsen
test)
from
baseline
to
12
weeks
from
a
pooled
analysis
of
three
trials
(455
participants)
was
-904
(95%
CI
-1937
to
128)
Two
pooled
results
favoured
ESWT
For
example
the
pooled
relative
risk
of
treatment
success
(at
least
50%
improvement
in
pain
with
resisted
wrist
extension
at
12
weeks)
for
ESWT
in
comparison
to
placebo
from
a
pooled
analysis
of
two
trials
(192
participants)
was
22
(95%
CI
155
to
312)
However
this
finding
was
not
supported
by
the
results
of
four
other
individual
trials
that
were
unable
to
be
pooled
Steroid
injection
was
more
effective
than
ESWT
at
3
months
after
the
end
of
treatment
assessed
by
a
reduction
of
pain
of
50%
from
baseline
(21/25
(84%)
versus
29/48
(60%)
p<005)
Minimal
adverse
effects
of
ESWT
were
reported
Most
commonly
these
were
transient
pain
reddening
of
the
skin
and
nausea
and
in
most
cases
did
not
require
treatment
discontinuation
or
dosage
adjustment
Based
upon
systematic
review
of
nine
placebo-controlled
trials
involving
1006
participants
there
is
"Platinum"
level
evidence
that
shock
wave
therapy
provides
little
or
no
benefit
in
terms
of
pain
and
function
in
lateral
elbow
pain
There
is
"Silver"
level
evidence
based
upon
one
trial
involving
93
participants
that
steroid
injection
may
be
more
effective
than
ESWT
