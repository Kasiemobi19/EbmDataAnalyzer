Title
Do
early

Abstract
Text
The
association
between
early
life
factors
and
body
mass
index
(BMI)
in
adulthood
has
been
demonstrated
in
developed
countries
The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
assess
the
influence
of
early
life
factors
(birth
weight
gestational
age
maternal
smoking
and
social
class)
on
BMI
in
young
adulthood
with
adjustment
for
adult
socioeconomic
position
A
cohort
study
was
carried
out
in
1978/79
with
6827
mother-child
pairs
from
Ribeirão
Preto
city
located
in
the
most
developed
economic
area
of
the
country
Biological
economic
and
social
variables
and
newborn
anthropometric
measurements
were
obtained
shortly
after
delivery
In
1996
1189
males
from
this
cohort
343%
of
the
original
male
population
were
submitted
to
anthropometric
measurements
and
were
asked
about
their
current
schooling
on
the
occasion
of
army
recruitment
A
multiple
linear
regression
model
was
applied
to
determine
variables
associated
with
BMI
Mean
BMI
was
227
(95%CI
=
225-230)
After
adjustment
BMI
was
122
kg/m(2)
higher
among
infants
born
with
high
birth
weight
(
>
or
=
4000
g)
121
kg/m(2)
higher
among
individuals
of
low
social
class
at
birth
and
069
kg/m(2)
higher
among
individuals
whose
mothers
smoked
during
pregnancy
(P
<
005)
The
association
between
social
class
at
birth
and
BMI
remained
statistically
significant
(P
<
005)
even
after
adjustment
for
adult
schooling
These
findings
suggest
that
early
life
social
influences
on
BMI
were
more
important
and
were
not
reversed
by
late
socioeconomic
position
Therefore
prevention
of
overweight
and
obesity
should
focus
not
only
on
changes
in
adult
life
styles
but
also
on
factors
such
as
high
birth
weight
