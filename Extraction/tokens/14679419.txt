Ursodeoxycholic
acid
and
atorvastatin
in
the
treatment
of
nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
Abstract
Text
Nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
(NASH)
is
a
serious
disorder
with
the
potential
to
gradually
progress
to
cirrhosis
It
is
generally
associated
with
obesity
diabetes
and
hyperlipidemia
Currently
there
is
no
established
therapy
for
NASH
The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
atorvastatin
and
ursodeoxycholic
acid
(UDCA)
in
the
treatment
of
NASH
This
prospective
study
included
44
adult
patients
(24
men
20
women)
with
a
mean
age
of
4890+/-769
years
and
mean
body
mass
index
(BMI)
of
2940+/-382
Ten
patients
had
a
history
of
diabetes
Serological
markers
for
viral
hepatitis
were
negative
in
all
patients
and
there
was
no
history
of
alcohol
or
drug
abuse
Patients
who
had
autoimmune
hepatitis
were
excluded
from
the
study
Liver
biopsy
was
performed
before
therapy
to
confirm
the
diagnosis
Among
NASH
patients
17
normolipidemic
cases
received
UDCA
13
to
15
mg/kg/day
(group
1)
while
hyperlipidemic
cases
(n=27)
received
atorvastatin
10
mg/day
(group
2)
for
six
months
The
BMI
serum
lipids
liver
function
tests
and
liver
density
assessed
by
computerized
tomography
were
evaluated
before
and
after
the
treatment
period
The
BMI
serum
aminotransferase
levels
histological
parameters
(steatosis
inflammation
fibrosis
scores)
and
liver
densities
were
not
statistically
different
between
the
groups
at
the
beginning
of
therapy
The
BMI
serum
glucose
and
triglyceride
levels
did
not
change
in
either
group
after
the
treatment
period
In
group
1
serum
alanine
aminotransferase
(ALT)
and
gamma-glutamyl-transferase
(GGT)
levels
reduced
significantly
and
in
group
2
serum
cholesterol
aspartate
aminotransferase
ALT
alkaline
phosphatase
and
GGT
levels
reduced
significantly
Liver
densities
increased
only
in
group
2
probably
as
a
result
of
diminishing
fat
content
of
liver
The
normalization
of
transaminases
was
also
more
prevalent
in
group
2
Liver
steatosis
was
closely
correlated
with
liver
density
but
inflammation
and
fibrosis
were
not
The
use
of
atorvastatin
in
NASH
patients
with
hyperlipidemia
was
found
to
be
both
effective
and
safe
The
benefit
of
statin
and
UDCA
therapy
in
normolipidemic
patients
with
NASH
requires
confirmation
with
further
placebo-controlled
trials
