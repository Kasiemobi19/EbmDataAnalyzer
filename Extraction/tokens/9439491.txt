Abstract
Text
Pilot
studies
suggested
that
more
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
virus
(HCV)
infection
had
a
sustained
virological
response
when
treated
with
the
combination
of
interferon
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
than
with
interferon
alpha-2b
alone
We
investigated
the
biochemical
and
virological
responses
and
safety
of
treatment
with
interferon
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
compared
with
interferon
alpha-2b
alone
In
this
double-blind
trial
100
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
treatment
with
interferon
alpha-2b
(3
MU
three
times
a
week)
in
combination
with
ribavirin
(1000
or
1200
mg
per
day)
or
placebo
for
24
weeks
and
then
followed
up
for
a
further
24
weeks
A
further
follow-up
was
done
1
year
after
active
treatment
stopped
The
primary
endpoint
was
the
sustained
virological
response
defined
as
no
detectable
HCV
RNA
by
PCR
at
both
week
24
and
week
48
Retrospectively
the
baseline
HCV-RNA
load
was
analysed
as
a
predictor
of
a
sustained
virological
response
Data
were
analysed
by
intention
to
treat
18
(36%)
of
the
50
patients
in
the
interferon
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
group
had
a
sustained
virological
response
compared
with
nine
(18%)
of
the
50
patients
in
the
interferon
alpha-2b
and
placebo
group
(p
=
0047)
At
the
1
year
follow-up
the
proportion
of
patients
with
a
virological
response
was
greater
in
the
interferon
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
group
than
the
interferon
alpha-2b
and
placebo
group
(42
vs
20%
p
=
003)
respectively
More
patients
with
baseline
HCV-RNA
concentrations
greater
than
3
x
10(6)
genome
equivalents
(Eq)
per
mL
had
a
sustained
response
with
interferon
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
than
with
interferon
alpha-2b
and
placebo
(12/29
vs
1/26
p
=
0009)
whereas
the
sustained
response
did
not
differ
between
the
two
treatment
groups
for
HCV-RNA
amounts
less
than
3
x
10(6)
Eq
per
mL
(6/21
vs
8/24
p
=
067)
respectively
More
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
have
a
sustained
virological
response
with
interferon
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
than
with
only
interferon
alpha-2b
treatment
We
suggest
that
patients
with
high
HCV-RNA
loads
should
be
treated
with
interferon
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
