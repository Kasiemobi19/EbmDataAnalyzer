Title
Controlled
trial
of
alpha-tocopherol
and
beta-carotene
supplements
on
stroke
incidence
and
mortality
in
male
smokers
Abstract
Text
Observational
data
suggest
that
diets
rich
in
fruits
and
vegetables
and
with
high
serum
levels
of
antioxidants
are
associated
with
decreased
incidence
and
mortality
of
stroke
We
studied
the
effects
of
alpha-tocopherol
and
beta-carotene
supplementation
The
incidence
and
mortality
of
stroke
were
examined
in
28
519
male
cigarette
smokers
aged
50
to
69
years
without
history
of
stroke
who
participated
in
the
Alpha-Tocopherol
Beta-Carotene
Cancer
Prevention
Study
(ATBC
Study)
The
daily
supplementation
was
50
mg
alpha-tocopherol
20
mg
beta-carotene
both
or
placebo
The
median
follow-up
was
60
years
A
total
of
1057
men
suffered
from
incident
stroke
85
men
had
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
112
intracerebral
hemorrhage
807
cerebral
infarction
and
53
unspecified
stroke
Deaths
due
to
stroke
within
3
months
numbered
38
50
65
and
7
respectively
(total
160)
alpha-Tocopherol
supplementation
increased
the
risk
of
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
50%
(95%
CI
-3%
to
132%
P=007)
but
decreased
that
of
cerebral
infarction
14%
(95%
CI
-25%
to
-1%
P=003)
whereas
beta-carotene
supplementation
increased
the
risk
of
intracerebral
hemorrhage
62%
(95%
CI
10%
to
136%
P=001)
alpha-Tocopherol
supplementation
also
increased
the
risk
of
fatal
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
181%
(95%
CI
37%
to
479%
P=001)
The
overall
net
effects
of
either
supplementation
on
the
incidence
and
mortality
from
total
stroke
were
nonsignificant
alpha-Tocopherol
supplementation
increases
the
risk
of
fatal
hemorrhagic
strokes
but
prevents
cerebral
infarction
The
effects
may
be
due
to
the
antiplatelet
actions
of
alpha-tocopherol
beta-Carotene
supplementation
increases
the
risk
of
intracerebral
hemorrhage
but
no
obvious
mechanism
is
available
