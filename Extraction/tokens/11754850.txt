Emergency
hernia
repairs
in
elderly
patients
Abstract
Text
Emergency
hernia
repairs
comprise
one
of
the
most
common
procedures
performed
in
elderly
patients
and
also
carry
a
high
risk
of
mortality
and
morbidity
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
factors
that
might
have
an
influence
on
the
outcome
of
emergency
hernia
repairs
in
elderly
patients
A
review
was
made
of
189
(120
male
and
69
female)
patients
aged
more
than
65
years
who
underwent
emergency
hernia
repair
between
December
1996
and
January
2001
at
the
surgical
emergency
unit
of
our
hospital
The
patients'
ages
ranged
from
65
to
100
years
(mean
721)
Concomitant
diseases
were
present
in
86
(455%)
patients
Of
189
incarcerated
hernias
there
were
145
(767%)
bowel
obstructions
and
91(48%)
strangulations
Necrotic
bowel
was
resected
in
36(19%)
patients
While
overall
mortality
was
5%
it
was
found
to
be
194%
after
bowel
resection
Major
complications
were
observed
in
48
(25%)
patients
Mortality
and
morbidity
were
clearly
linked
with
bowel
resection
Coexisting
cardiopulmonary
diseases
misdiagnosis
American
Society
of
Anesthesiologists
class
and
late
admission
were
also
found
to
be
responsible
for
unfavorable
outcomes
In
elderly
patients
with
external
hernias
early
elective
surgery
should
be
preferred
and
local
anesthesia
might
be
the
best
in
order
to
avoid
the
increased
risks
of
emergency
hernia
repairs
