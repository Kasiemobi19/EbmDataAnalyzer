Title
Quality-of-life
outcomes
after
surgical
intervention
for
otitis
media
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
change
in
disease-specific
quality
of
life
in
children
with
recurrent
acute
otitis
media
and/or
chronic
otitis
media
with
effusion
treated
with
surgical
intervention
Prospective
questionnaire-based
outcome
study
An
academic
pediatric
otolaryngology
practice
Consecutive
series
of
123
children
referred
for
surgical
treatment
of
recurrent
acute
otitis
media
and/or
chronic
otitis
media
with
effusion
INTERVENTION
AND
METHODS
Surgery
included
bilateral
myringotomy
and
tympanostomy
tube
placement
either
alone
or
with
adenoidectomy
An
otitis
media
disease-specific
questionnaire
was
administered
before
and
after
surgical
intervention
Comparison
of
the
mean
percentage
change
in
total
ear
symptom
score
between
presurgery
and
postsurgery
scores
at
1
and
6
months
after
surgery
The
mean
percentage
change
in
total
ear
symptom
score
was
a
745%
improvement
(P<001)
at
the
1-month
follow-up
and
a
598%
improvement
(P<001)
at
the
6-month
follow-up
Parental
worry
related
to
the
child's
ear
problems
was
also
significantly
decreased
with
a
mean
otitis
media
disease-specific
questionnaire
score
of
343
(P<001)
at
1
month
and
264
(P<001)
at
6
months
after
surgery
When
caregivers
were
asked
if
they
would
have
their
child
undergo
tympanostomy
tube
placement
if
they
had
to
make
the
decision
again
91%
and
84%
responded
yes
at
the
1-
and
6-month
follow-up
respectively
The
disease-specific
quality
of
life
of
children
with
recurrent
acute
otitis
media
and/or
chronic
otitis
media
with
effusion
with
appropriate
surgical
indications
significantly
improved
after
surgical
intervention
The
amount
of
parental
worry
concerning
their
children's
ear
problems
also
significantly
improved
following
surgery
and
most
caregivers
would
opt
again
for
tube
placement
