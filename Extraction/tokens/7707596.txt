Changes
in
physical
fitness
and
all-cause
mortality
A
prospective
study
of
healthy
and
unhealthy
men
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
relationship
between
changes
in
physical
fitness
and
risk
of
mortality
in
men
Prospective
study
with
two
clinical
examinations
(mean
interval
between
examinations
49
years)
to
assess
change
or
lack
of
change
in
physical
fitness
as
associated
with
risk
of
mortality
during
follow-up
after
the
subsequent
examination
(mean
follow-up
from
subsequent
examination
51
years)
Preventive
medicine
clinic
Participants
were
9777
men
given
two
preventive
medical
examinations
each
of
which
included
assessment
of
physical
fitness
by
maximal
exercise
tests
and
evaluation
of
health
status
All
cause
(n
=
223)
and
cardiovascular
disease
(n
=
87)
mortality
The
highest
age-adjusted
all-cause
death
rate
was
observed
in
men
who
were
unfit
at
both
examinations
(1220/10000
man-years)
the
lowest
death
rate
was
in
men
who
were
physically
fit
at
both
examinations
(396/10000
man-years)
Men
who
improved
from
unfit
to
fit
between
the
first
and
subsequent
examinations
had
an
age-adjusted
death
rate
of
677/10000
man-years
This
is
a
reduction
in
mortality
risk
of
44%
(95%
confidence
interval
25%
to
59%)
relative
to
men
who
remained
unfit
at
both
examinations
Improvement
in
fitness
was
associated
with
lower
death
rates
after
adjusting
for
age
health
status
and
other
risk
factors
of
premature
mortality
For
each
minute
increase
in
maximal
treadmill
time
between
examinations
there
was
a
corresponding
79%
(P
=
001)
decrease
in
risk
of
mortality
Similar
results
were
seen
when
the
group
was
stratified
by
health
status
and
for
cardiovascular
disease
mortality
Men
who
maintained
or
improved
adequate
physical
fitness
were
less
likely
to
die
from
all
causes
and
from
cardiovascular
disease
during
follow-up
than
persistently
unfit
men
Physicians
should
encourage
unfit
men
to
improve
their
fitness
by
starting
a
physical
activity
program
