Abstract
Text
Various
types
of
urinary
tract
infection
(UTI)
occur
in
men
In
this
study
we
examined
health
care
use
trends
including
epidemiological
and
economic
factors
for
UTI
in
men
in
the
United
States
The
analytical
methods
used
to
generate
these
results
have
been
described
previously
Approximately
20%
of
all
UTIs
occur
in
men
Between
1988
and
1994
the
overall
lifetime
prevalence
of
UTI
was
estimated
to
be
13689/100000
men
Orchitis
rates
particularly
in
older
men
are
generally
higher
than
those
of
cystitis
or
pyelonephritis
Approximately
10%
of
all
inpatient
care
of
men
with
UTI
is
for
orchitis
(12
to
14/100000
population)
Rates
of
outpatient
hospital
and
physician
office
care
for
male
UTI
have
increased
in
the
last
decade
Rates
for
emergency
room
care
for
UTI
in
elderly
men
(85
to
94
years
old)
were
almost
twice
those
in
men
younger
than
85
years
The
adjusted
mean
health
care
expenditure
for
privately
insured
men
with
UTI
was
5544
dollars
in
1999
compared
to
2715
dollars
for
men
without
UTI
Total
annual
health
care
expenditures
for
men
and
women
with
UTI
were
5544
dollars
and
5407
dollars
respectively
Mean
time
lost
from
work
was
slightly
higher
for
men
Based
on
composite
data
overall
medical
expenditures
for
men
with
UTI
in
the
United
States
were
estimated
to
be
approximately
1028
billion
dollars
in
2000
Health
care
use
and
economic
data
on
UTIs
in
men
revealed
a
number
of
intriguing
trends
These
results
raise
various
important
questions
for
future
research
