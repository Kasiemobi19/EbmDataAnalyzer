A
cost/efficacy
analysis
of
oral
antifungals
indicated
for
the
treatment
of
onychomycosis
griseofulvin
itraconazole
and
terbinafine
Abstract
Text
This
analysis
was
conducted
at
HIP
Health
plan
of
New
Jersey
(a
Northeastern
group
model
health
maintenance
organization)
to
determine
the
most
cost-effective
therapy
among
the
three
currently
available
oral
antifungal
drugs
that
are
indicated
for
the
treatment
of
onychomycosis
griseofulvin
itraconazole
and
terbinafine
Costs
of
an
appropriate
and
complete
treatment
regimen
were
calculated
for
each
of
the
three
drugs
based
on
average
wholesale
price
Efficacy
was
determined
by
meta-analysis
of
the
published
literature
for
those
studies
where
appropriate
treatment
regimens
for
onychomycosis
were
put
to
use
Efficacy
outcome
measures
were
limited
to
mycologic
cure
rates
in
the
more
recalcitrant
cases
of
toenail
onychomycosis
From
these
measures
of
cost
and
efficacy
a
cost/efficacy
ratio
was
calculated
for
each
drug
by
dividing
the
cost
per
treatment
by
the
weighted
average
mycological
cure
rate
This
ratio
represents
the
cost
per
mycologically
cured
infection
The
final
outcome
measure
(the
cost
per
mycologically
cured
infection)
was
$272128
$184505
and
$64896
for
griseofulvin
itraconazole
and
terbinafine
continuous
therapies
respectively
For
itraconazole
and
terbinafine
pulse
therapy
the
costs
were
$85588
and
$38850
respectively
For
both
continuous
and
pulse
therapy
terbinafine
is
apparently
the
most
cost-effective
drug
followed
by
itraconazole
and
then
by
griseofulvin
Terbinafine
has
the
fewest
drug
interactions
and
the
highest
treatment
success
rate
