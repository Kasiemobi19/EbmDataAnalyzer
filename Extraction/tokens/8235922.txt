Comparative
evaluation
of
ofloxacin
and
metronidazole
in
the
treatment
of
bacterial
vaginosis
Abstract
Text
The
epidemiology
and
etiology
of
bacterial
vaginosis
is
poorly
understood
Many
antimicrobial
agents
have
been
studied
and
suggested
as
treatment
alternatives
for
this
infection
Fluoroquinolones
have
in
vitro
activity
against
some
of
the
organisms
associated
with
bacterial
vaginosis
and
may
provide
another
treatment
option
Women
who
presented
with
symptomatic
bacterial
vaginosis
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
oral
ofloxacin
300
mg
twice
a
day
or
oral
metronidazole
500
mg
twice
a
day
for
seven
days
Twenty-seven
of
the
31
patients
who
were
enrolled
in
this
double-blinded
study
were
evaluable
Fourteen
women
received
ofloxacin
At
follow-up
four
had
no
residual
symptoms
seven
noted
a
reduction
in
symptoms
and
three
had
no
change
in
symptoms
Eight
(57%)
of
the
14
women
who
received
ofloxacin
had
secretions
at
follow-up
that
satisfied
the
criteria
for
the
diagnosis
of
bacterial
vaginosis
Thirteen
women
received
metronidazole
Nine
had
no
residual
symptoms
and
four
noted
a
reduction
in
symptoms
Eleven
(85%)
of
the
13
women
had
normal
vaginal
secretions
and
two
(15%)
had
secretions
that
were
improved
None
of
the
women
who
received
metronidazole
had
secretions
at
follow-up
that
met
the
criteria
for
the
diagnosis
of
bacterial
vaginosis
We
conclude
that
ofloxacin
is
less
effective
than
metronidazole
in
the
treatment
of
bacterial
vaginosis
