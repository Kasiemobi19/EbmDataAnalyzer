medical
guidelines
for
clinical

for
the
evaluation

Abstract
Text
These
clinical
practice
guidelines
summarize
the
recommendations
of
the
American
Association
of
Clinical
Endocrinologists
for
the
diagnostic
evaluation
of
hyperthyroidism
and
hypothyroidism
and
for
treatment
strategies
in
patients
with
these
disorders
The
sensitive
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
(TSH
or
thyrotropin)
assay
has
become
the
single
best
screening
test
for
hyperthyroidism
and
hypothyroidism
and
in
most
outpatient
clinical
situations
the
serum
TSH
is
the
most
sensitive
test
for
detecting
mild
thyroid
hormone
excess
or
deficiency
Therapeutic
options
for
patients
with
Graves'
disease
include
thyroidectomy
(rarely
used
now
in
the
United
States)
antithyroid
drugs
(frequently
associated
with
relapses)
and
radioactive
iodine
(currently
the
treatment
of
choice)
In
clinical
hypothyroidism
the
standard
treatment
is
levothyroxine
replacement
which
must
be
tailored
to
the
individual
patient
Awareness
of
subclinical
thyroid
disease
which
often
remains
undiagnosed
is
emphasized
as
is
a
system
of
care
that
incorporates
regular
follow-up
surveillance
by
one
physician
as
well
as
education
and
involvement
of
the
patient
