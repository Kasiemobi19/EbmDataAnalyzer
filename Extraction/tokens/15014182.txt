Purine-rich
foods
dairy
and
protein
intake
and
the
risk
of
gout
in
men
Abstract
Text
Various
purine-rich
foods
and
high
protein
intake
have
long
been
thought
to
be
risk
factors
for
gout
Similarly
the
possibility
that
the
consumption
of
dairy
products
has
a
role
in
protecting
against
gout
has
been
raised
by
metabolic
studies
We
prospectively
investigated
the
association
of
these
dietary
factors
with
new
cases
of
gout
Over
a
12-year
period
we
prospectively
examined
the
relationship
between
purported
dietary
risk
factors
and
new
cases
of
gout
among
47150
men
who
had
no
history
of
gout
at
base
line
We
used
a
supplementary
questionnaire
to
ascertain
whether
participants
met
the
American
College
of
Rheumatology
survey
criteria
for
gout
Diet
was
assessed
every
four
years
by
means
of
a
food-frequency
questionnaire
During
the
12
years
of
the
study
we
documented
730
confirmed
new
cases
of
gout
The
multivariate
relative
risk
of
gout
among
men
in
the
highest
quintile
of
meat
intake
as
compared
with
those
in
the
lowest
quintile
was
141
(95
percent
confidence
interval
107
to
186
P
for
trend
=
002)
and
the
corresponding
relative
risk
associated
with
seafood
intake
was
151
(95
percent
confidence
interval
117
to
195
P
for
trend
=
002)
In
contrast
the
incidence
of
gout
decreased
with
increasing
intake
of
dairy
products
the
multivariate
relative
risk
among
men
in
the
highest
quintile
as
compared
with
those
in
the
lowest
quintile
was
056
(95
percent
confidence
interval
042
to
074
P
for
trend
<0001)
The
level
of
consumption
of
purine-rich
vegetables
and
the
total
protein
intake
were
not
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
gout
Higher
levels
of
meat
and
seafood
consumption
are
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
gout
whereas
a
higher
level
of
consumption
of
dairy
products
is
associated
with
a
decreased
risk
Moderate
intake
of
purine-rich
vegetables
or
protein
is
not
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
gout
