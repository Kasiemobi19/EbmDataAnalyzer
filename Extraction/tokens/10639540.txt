Abstract
Text
Observational
and
experimental
studies
suggest
that
the
amount
of
vitamin
E
ingested
in
food
and
in
supplements
is
associated
with
a
lower
risk
of
coronary
heart
disease
and
atherosclerosis
We
enrolled
a
total
of
2545
women
and
6996
men
55
years
of
age
or
older
who
were
at
high
risk
for
cardiovascular
events
because
they
had
cardiovascular
disease
or
diabetes
in
addition
to
one
other
risk
factor
These
patients
were
randomly
assigned
according
to
a
two-by-two
factorial
design
to
receive
either
400
IU
of
vitamin
E
daily
from
natural
sources
or
matching
placebo
and
either
an
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor
(ramipril)
or
matching
placebo
for
a
mean
of
45
years
(the
results
of
the
comparison
of
ramipril
and
placebo
are
reported
in
a
companion
article)
The
primary
outcome
was
a
composite
of
myocardial
infarction
stroke
and
death
from
cardiovascular
causes
The
secondary
outcomes
included
unstable
angina
congestive
heart
failure
revascularization
or
amputation
death
from
any
cause
complications
of
diabetes
and
cancer
A
total
of
772
of
the
4761
patients
assigned
to
vitamin
E
(162
percent)
and
739
of
the
4780
assigned
to
placebo
(155
percent)
had
a
primary
outcome
event
(relative
risk
105
95
percent
confidence
interval
095
to
116
P=033)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
numbers
of
deaths
from
cardiovascular
causes
(342
of
those
assigned
to
vitamin
E
vs
328
of
those
assigned
to
placebo
relative
risk
105
95
percent
confidence
interval
090
to
122)
myocardial
infarction
(532
vs
524
relative
risk
102
95
percent
confidence
interval
090
to
115)
or
stroke
(209
vs
180
relative
risk
117
95
percent
confidence
interval
095
to
142)
There
were
also
no
significant
differences
in
the
incidence
of
secondary
cardiovascular
outcomes
or
in
death
from
any
cause
There
were
no
significant
adverse
effects
of
vitamin
E

In
patients
at
high
risk
for
cardiovascular
events
treatment
with
vitamin
E
for
a
mean
of
45
years
had
no
apparent
effect
on
cardiovascular
outcomes
