To
resolve
discrepancies
in
previous
systematic
overviews
and
provide
estimates
of
the
effect
of
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
on
gastrointestinal
bleeding
pneumonia
and
mortality
in
critically
ill
patients
Computerized

Independent
review
of
269
articles
identified
63
relevant
randomized
trials
for
inclusion
We
made
independent
duplicate
assessment
of
the
methodologic
quality
population
intervention
and
outcomes
of
each
trial
The
source
of
discrepancies
between
prior
meta-analyses
included
incomplete
identification
of
relevant
studies
differential
inclusion
of
non-English
language
and
nonrandomized
trials
different

of
bleeding
provision
of
additional
information
through
direct
correspondence
with
authors
and
different
statistical
methods
The
current
overview
demonstrates
that
prophylaxis
with
histamine2-receptor
antagonists
decreases
the
incidence
of
overt
gastrointestinal
bleeding
(odds
ratio
[OR]
058
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
042
to
079)
and
clinically
important
bleeding
(OR
044
95%
CI
022
to
088)
There
is
a
trend
toward
decreased
overt
bleeding
when
antacids
are
compared
with
no
therapy
(OR
066
95%
CI
037
to
117)
Histamine2-receptor
antagonists
and
antacids
are
associated
with
a
trend
toward
lower
clinically
important
bleeding
rates
than
sucralfate
is
There
is
a
trend
toward
an
increased
risk
of
pneumonia
associated
with
histamine2-receptor
antagonists
as
compared
with
no
prophylaxis
(OR
125
95%
CI
078
to
200)
Sucralfate
is
associated
with
a
lower
incidence
of
nosocomial
pneumonia
when
compared
with
antacids
(OR
080
95%
CI
056
to
115)
and
histamine2-receptor
antagonists
(OR
077
95%
CI
060
to
101)
Sucralfate
is
also
associated
with
a
reduced
mortality
rate
(OR
073
95%
CI
054
to
097)
relative
to
antacids
and
to
histamine2-receptor
antagonists
(OR
083
95%
CI
063
to
109)
Our
results
emphasize
the
need
for
registries
to
include
all
randomized
trials
and
demonstrate
the
importance
of
explicit
methodology
for
systematic
reviews
There
is
strong
evidence
of
reduced
clinically
important
gastrointestinal
bleeding
with
histamine2-receptor
antagonists
Sucralfate
may
be
as
effective
in
reducing
bleeding
as
gastric
pH-altering
drugs
and
is
associated
with
lower
rates
of
pneumonia
and
mortality
However
the
data
are
insufficient
to
determine
the
net
effect
of
sucralfate
compared
with
no
prophylaxis
