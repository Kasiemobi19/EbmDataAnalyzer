Medical
management
of
orbital
cellulitis
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
appropriate
early
management
of
orbital
cellulitis
and
the
current
bacterial
etiology
and
to
evaluate
the
clinical
usefulness
of
orbital
computed
tomographic
imaging
for
this
infection
a
prospective
study
of
orbital
cellulitis
was
conducted
during
a
2-year
period
1999
to
2000
after
the
introduction
of
a
conservative
medical
management
plan
designed
by
our
pediatric
infectious
diseases
ophthalmology
and
otolaryngology
services
Basically
patients
did
not
have
surgical
intervention
unless
progressive
involvement
of
the
optic
nerve
occurred
after
24
to
36
h
of
intravenous
antimicrobial
therapy
Nine
patients
had
orbital
cellulitis
and
subperiosteal
abscesses
only
one
required
surgical
drainage
because
of
progressive
disease
this
case
being
culture-negative
One
had
a
blood
culture
positive
for
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
conjunctival
cultures
showed
moderate
to
heavy
growth
for
S
pneumoniae
from
this
and
two
other
patients
but
otherwise
bacterial
etiology
could
not
be
defined
Haemophilus
influenzae
was
not
recovered
from
any
of
their
blood
or
conjunctival
cultures
This
experience
during
the
computed
tomography
scan
and
Haemophilus
vaccine
era
supports
an
initial
medical
management
approach
for
most
patients
with
subperiosteal
or
retrobulbar
abscesses
resulting
in
orbital
cellulitis
