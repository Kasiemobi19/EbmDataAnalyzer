Differentiated
long-term

of
intentional

on
diabetes

Abstract
Text
The
beneficial
effects
of
weight
loss
in
the
obese
have
been
widely
accepted
Still
there
is
a
lack
of
controlled
studies
displaying
large
maintained
weight
losses
over
long
periods
(>4
years)
We
wanted
to
examine
the
results
of
long-standing
intentional
weight
loss
on
the
development
of
diabetes
and
hypertension
in
severely
obese
individuals
over
an
8-year
period
In
the
ongoing
prospective
Swedish
Obese
Subjects
(SOS)
study
346
patients
awaiting
gastric
surgery
were
matched
with
346
obese
control
subjects
on
18
variables
by
a
computerized
matching
program
The
controls
were
drawn
from
a
registry
consisting
of
1508
obese
potential
controls
examined
at
primary
health
care
centers
in
Sweden
Of
the
692
selected
patients
(body
mass
index
412+/-47
kg/m(2)
[mean+/-SD])
483
(70%)
were
followed
for
8
years
No
significant
weight
changes
occurred
in
the
obese
control
group
over
8
years
Gastric
surgery
resulted
in
a
maximum
weight
loss
of
-311+/-136
kg
after
1
year
After
8
years
the
maintained
weight
loss
was
still
201+/-157
kg
(163+/-123%)
Whereas
this
weight
reduction
had
a
dramatic
effect
on
the
8-year
incidence
of
diabetes
(odds
ratio
016
95%
CI
007
to
036)
it
had
no
effect
on
the
8-year
incidence
of
hypertension
(odds
ratio
101
95%
CI
061
to
167)
A
differentiated
risk
factor
response
was
identified
a
maintained
weight
reduction
of
16%
strongly
counteracted
the
development
of
diabetes
over
8
years
but
showed
no
long-term
effect
on
the
incidence
of
hypertension
