The
sensitivity

and
predictive
value
of
traditional
clinical
evaluation
of
peripheral
arterial

results
from
noninvasive
testing
in
a
defined
population
Abstract
Text
In
a
companion
article
we
have
reported
the
prevalence
in
an
older
defined
population
of
traditional
assessments
(intermittent
claudication
and
abnormal
pulse
examination)
of
peripheral
arterial
disease
(PAD)
as
compared
with
the
results
of
highly
accurate
noninvasive
testing
In
this
article
we
report
the
sensitivity
specificity
and
positive
and
negative
predictive
values
for
claudication
and
abnormal
pulses
for
the
diagnosis
of
large-vessel
and
small-vessel
PAD
as
determined
by
noninvasive
testing
Claudication
and
abnormal
pulses
were
completely
unrelated
to
isolated
small-vessel
PAD
In
contrast
both
claudication
and
abnormal
pulses
were
significantly
correlated
with
large-vessel
PAD
Claudication
and
an
abnormal
femoral
pulse
showed
a
high
specificity
and
positive
predictive
value
but
a
low
sensitivity
for
large-vessel
PAD
Conversely
an
abnormal
dorsalis
pedis
pulse
showed
a
good
sensitivity
but
low
specificity
and
positive
predictive
value
The
best
single
discriminator
was
an
abnormal
posterior
tibial
pulse
which
had
high
sensitivity
specificity
and
positive
predictive
value
Various
combinations
of
claudication
and
pulse
abnormalities
revealed
a
good
sensitivity
for
broader
criteria
but
at
the
expense
of
specificity
whereas
stricter
criteria
had
a
good
specificity
and
positive
predictive
value
but
a
poor
sensitivity
No
combination
was
superior
to
an
abnormal
posterior
tibial
pulse
