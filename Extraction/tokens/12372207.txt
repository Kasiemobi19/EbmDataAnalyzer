Estimate
pneumococcal

Clinical

cohort
and
case-control
studies
published
in
Spanish
English
or
French
that
estimated
pneumococcal
disease
rates
in
vaccinated
or
not
vaccinated
elderly
The
studies
were
valued
independently
by
four
investigators
with
predefined
criteria
of
validity
such
as
results
comparing
rates
of
disease
caused
by
serotypes
included
in
the
vaccine
random
allocation
double
blind
design
included
subjects
pertaining
to
the
same
study
base
and
losses
of
less
than
10%
in
clinical
trials
and
20%
in
observational
studies
Eight
clinical
trials
considered
the
relative
risk
(RR)
of
pneumococcal
pneumonia
three
did
not
make
estimations
on
pneumonia
originated
by
serotypes
included
in
the
vaccine
and
only
one
study
fulfilled
all
the
inclusion
criteria
Vaccinated
versus
not
vaccinated
pneumococcal
pneumonia
RR
was
086
(95%CI
024
to
299)
Vaccine
effectiveness
was
14%
(95%CI
-199
to
76%)
Ten
studies
performed
estimations
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
vaccine
on
invasive
disease
by
vaccine
serotypes
Of
these
two
clinical
trials
and
two
observational
studies
fulfilled
the
required
quality
criteria
RR
of
invasive
disease
was
of
068
(95%CI
039-118)
vaccine
effectiveness
was
32%
(95%CI

No

was
found
supporting
pneumococcal
vaccine
effectiveness
to
reduce
