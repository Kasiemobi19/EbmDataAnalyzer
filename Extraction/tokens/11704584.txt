Low
dose
inhaled
budesonide
and
formoterol
in
mild
persistent
asthma
the
OPTIMA
randomized
trial
Abstract
Text
The
optimal
treatment
for
mild
asthma
is
uncertain
We
assessed
the
effects
of
adding
a
long-acting
inhaled
beta-agonist
formoterol
to
low
doses
of
an
inhaled
corticosteroid
budesonide
for
1
yr
in
subjects
with
mild
asthma
receiving
no
or
only
a
small
dose
of
inhaled
corticosteroid
The
698
corticosteroid
free
patients
(Group
A)
were
assigned
to
twice
daily
treatment
with
100
microg
budesonide
100
microg
budesonide
plus
45
microg
formoterol
or
placebo
The
1272
corticosteroid-treated
patients
(Group
B)
were
assigned
to
twice
daily
treatment
with
100
microg
budesonide
100
microg
budesonide
plus
45
microg
formoterol
200
microg
budesonide
or
200
microg
budesonide
plus
45
microg
formoterol
The
main
outcome
variables
were
time
to
the
first
severe
asthma
exacerbation
and
poorly
controlled
asthma
days
In
Group
A
budesonide
alone
reduced
the
risk
for
severe
exacerbations
by
60%
and
poorly
controlled
days
by
48%
adding
formoterol
increased
lung
function
with
no
change
in
other
end
points
By
contrast
in
Group
B
adding
formoterol
reduced
the
risk
for
the
first
severe
exacerbation
and
for
poorly
controlled
days
by
43
and
30%
respectively
Thus
in
corticosteroid-free
patients
low
dose
inhaled
budesonide
alone
reduced
severe
exacerbations
and
improved
asthma
control
and
in
patients
already
receiving
inhaled
corticosteroid
adding
formoterol
was
more
effective
than
doubling
the
corticosteroid
dose
