prospective

Abstract
Text
To
assess
associations
between
baseline
values
of
four
different
circulating
markers
of
inflammation
and
future
risk
of
coronary
heart
disease
potential
triggers
of
systemic
inflammation
(such
as
persistent
infection)
and
other
markers
of
inflammation
Nested
case-control
comparisons
in
a
prospective
population
based
cohort
General
practices
in
18
towns
in
Britain
506
men
who
died
from
coronary
heart
disease
or
had
a
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
and
1025
men
who
remained
free
of
such
disease
until
1996
selected
from
5661
men
aged
40-59
years
who
provided
blood
samples
in
1978-1980
Plasma
concentrations
of
C
reactive
protein
serum
amyloid
A
protein
and
serum
albumin
and
leucocyte
count
Information
on
fatal
and
non-fatal
coronary
heart
disease
was
obtained
from
medical
records
and
death
certificates
Compared
with
men
in
the
bottom
third
of
baseline
measurements
of
C
reactive
protein
men
in
the
top
third
had
an
odds
ratio
for
coronary
heart
disease
of
213
(95%
confidence
interval
138
to
328)
after
age
town
smoking
vascular
risk
factors
and
indicators
of
socioeconomic
status
were
adjusted
for
Similar
adjusted
odds
ratios
were
165
(107
to
255)
for
serum
amyloid
A
protein
112
(071
to
177)
for
leucocyte
count
and
067
(043
to
104)
for
albumin
No
strong
associations
were
observed
of
these
factors
with
Helicobacter
pylori
seropositivity
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
IgG
titres
or
plasma
total
homocysteine
concentrations
Baseline
values
of
the
acute
phase
reactants
were
significantly
associated
with
one
another
(P<00001)
although
the
association
between
low
serum
albumin
concentration
and
leucocyte
count
was
weaker
(P=008)
In
the
context
of
results
from
other
relevant
studies
these
findings
suggest
that
some
inflammatory
processes
unrelated
to
the
chronic
infections
studied
here
are
likely
to
be
involved
in
coronary
heart
disease
