Study

trial
Abstract
Text
Throughout
the
usual
LDL
cholesterol
range
in
Western
populations
lower
blood
concentrations
are
associated
with
lower
cardiovascular
disease
risk
In
such
populations
therefore
reducing
LDL
cholesterol
may
reduce
the
development
of
vascular
disease
largely
irrespective
of
initial
cholesterol
concentrations
20536
UK
adults
(aged
40-80
years)
with
coronary
disease
other
occlusive
arterial
disease
or
diabetes
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
40
mg
simvastatin
daily
(average
compliance
85%)
or
matching
placebo
(average
non-study
statin
use
17%)
Analyses
are
of
the
first
occurrence
of
particular
events
and
compare
all
simvastatin-allocated
versus
all
placebo-allocated
participants
These
"intention-to-treat"
comparisons
assess
the
effects
of
about
two-thirds
(85%
minus
17%)
taking
a
statin
during
the
scheduled
5-year
treatment
period
which
yielded
an
average
difference
in
LDL
cholesterol
of
10
mmol/L
(about
two-thirds
of
the
effect
of
actual
use
of
40
mg
simvastatin
daily)
Primary
outcomes
were
mortality
(for
overall
analyses)
and
fatal
or
non-fatal
vascular
events
(for
subcategory
analyses)
with
subsidiary
assessments
of
cancer
and
of
other
major
morbidity
All-cause
mortality
was
significantly
reduced
(1328
[129%]
deaths
among
10269
allocated
simvastatin
versus
1507
[147%]
among
10267
allocated
placebo
p=00003)
due
to
a
highly
significant
18%
(SE
5)
proportional
reduction
in
the
coronary
death
rate
(587
[57%]
vs
707
[69%]
p=00005)
a
marginally
significant
reduction
in
other
vascular
deaths
(194
[19%]
vs
230
[22%]
p=007)
and
a
non-significant
reduction
in
non-vascular
deaths
(547
[53%]
vs
570
[56%]
p=04)
There
were
highly
significant
reductions
of
about
one-quarter
in
the
first
event
rate
for
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
or
coronary
death
(898
[87%]
vs
1212
[118%]
p<00001)
for
non-fatal
or
fatal
stroke
(444
[43%]
vs
585
[57%]
p<00001)
and
for
coronary
or
non-coronary
revascularisation
(939
[91%]
vs
1205
[117%]
p<00001)
For
the
first
occurrence
of
any
of
these
major
vascular
events
there
was
a
definite
24%
(SE
3
95%
CI
19-28)
reduction
in
the
event
rate
(2033
[198%]
vs
2585
[252%]
affected
individuals
p<00001)
During
the
first
year
the
reduction
in
major
vascular
events
was
not
significant
but
subsequently
it
was
highly
significant
during
each
separate
year
The
proportional
reduction
in
the
event
rate
was
similar
(and
significant)
in
each
subcategory
of
participant
studied
including
those
without
diagnosed
coronary
disease
who
had
cerebrovascular
disease
or
had
peripheral
artery
disease
or
had
diabetes
men
and
separately
women
those
aged
either
under
or
over
70
years
at
entry
and--most
notably--even
those
who
presented
with
LDL
cholesterol
below
30
mmol/L
(116
mg/dL)
or
total
cholesterol
below
50
mmol/L
(193
mg/dL)
The
benefits
of
simvastatin
were
additional
to
those
of
other
cardioprotective
treatments
The
annual
excess
risk
of
myopathy
with
this
regimen
was
about
001%
There
were
no
significant
adverse
effects
on
cancer
incidence
or
on
hospitalisation
for
any
other
non-vascular
cause
Adding
simvastatin
to
existing
treatments
safely
produces
substantial
additional
benefits
for
a
wide
range
of
high-risk
patients
irrespective
of
their
initial
cholesterol
concentrations
Allocation
to
40
mg
simvastatin
daily
reduced
the
rates
of
myocardial
infarction
of
stroke
and
of
revascularisation
by
about
one-quarter
After
making
allowance
for
non-compliance
actual
use
of
this
regimen
would
probably
reduce
these
rates
by
about
one-third
Hence
among
the
many
types
of
high-risk
individual
studied
5
years
of
simvastatin
would
prevent
about
70-100
people
per
1000
from
suffering
at
least
one
of
these
major
vascular
events
(and
longer
treatment
should
produce
further
benefit)
The
size
of
the
5-year
benefit
depends
chiefly
on
such
individuals'
overall
risk
of
major
vascular
events
rather
than
on
their
blood
lipid
concentrations
alone
