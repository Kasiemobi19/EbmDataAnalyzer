Risedronate
increases
bone
mineral
density
in
elderly
women
but
whether
it
prevents
hip
fracture
is
not
known
We
studied
5445
women
70
to
79
years
old
who
had
osteoporosis
(indicated
by
a
T
score
for
bone
mineral
density
at
the
femoral
neck
that
was
more
than
4
SD
below
the
mean
peak
value
in
young
adults
[-4]
or
lower
than
-3
plus
a
nonskeletal
risk
factor
for
hip
fracture
such
as
poor
gait
or
a
propensity
to
fall)
and
3886
women
at
least
80
years
old
who
had
at
least
one
nonskeletal
risk
factor
for
hip
fracture
or
low
bone
mineral
density
at
the
femoral
neck
(T
score
lower
than
-4
or
lower
than
-3
plus
a
hip-axis
length
of
111
cm
or
greater)
The
women
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
treatment
with
oral
risedronate
(25
or
50
mg
daily)
or
placebo
for
three
years
The
primary
end
point
was
the
occurrence
of
hip
fracture
Overall
the
incidence
of
hip
fracture
among
all
the
women
assigned
to
risedronate
was
28
percent
as
compared
with
39
percent
among
those
assigned
to
placebo
(relative
risk
07
95
percent
confidence
interval
06
to
09
P=002)
In
the
group
of
women
with
osteoporosis
(those
70
to
79
years
old)
the
incidence
of
hip
fracture
among
those
assigned
to
risedronate
was
19
percent
as
compared
with
32
percent
among
those
assigned
to
placebo
(relative
risk
06
95
percent
confidence
interval
04
to
09
P=0009)
In
the
group
of
women
selected
primarily
on
the
basis
of
nonskeletal
risk
factors
(those
at
least
80
years
of
age)
the
incidence
of
hip
fracture
was
42
percent
among
those
assigned
to
risedronate
and
51
percent
among
those
assigned
to
placebo
(P=035)
Risedronate
significantly
reduces
the
risk
of
hip
fracture
among
elderly
women
with
confirmed
osteoporosis
but
not
among
elderly
women
selected
primarily
on
the
basis
of
risk
factors
other
than
low
bone
mineral
density
