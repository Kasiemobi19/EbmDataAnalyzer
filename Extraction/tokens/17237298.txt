Improved
effectiveness
of
partner

for

sexually

systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
effectiveness
of
methods
to
improve
partner
notification
by
patient
referral
(index
patient
has
responsibility
for
informing
sex
partners
of
their
exposure
to
a
sexually
transmitted
infection)
Systematic
review
of
randomised
trials
of
any
intervention
to
supplement
simple
patient
referral
Seven
electronic
databases
searched
(January
1990
to
December
2005)
without
language
restriction
and
reference
lists
of
retrieved
articles
Selection
of
trials
data
extraction
and
quality
assessment
were
done
by
two
independent
reviewers
The
primary
outcome
was
a
reduction
of
incidence
or
prevalence
of
sexually
transmitted
infections
in
index
patients
If
this
was
not
reported
data
were
extracted
according
to
a
hierarchy
of
secondary
outcomes
number
of
partners
treated
number
of
partners
tested
or
testing
positive
and
number
of
partners
notified
located
or
elicited
Random
effects
meta-analysis
was
carried
out
when
appropriate
14
trials
were
included
with
12
389
women
and
men
diagnosed
as
having
gonorrhoea
chlamydia
non-gonococcal
urethritis
trichomoniasis
or
a
sexually
transmitted
infection
syndrome
All
studies
had
methodological
weaknesses
that
could
have
biased
their
results
Three
strategies
were
used
Six
trials
examined
patient
delivered
partner
therapy
Meta-analysis
of
five
of
these
showed
a
reduced
risk
of
persistent
or
recurrent
infection
in
patients
with
chlamydia
or
gonorrhoea
(summary
risk
ratio
073
95%
confidence
interval
057
to
093)
Supplementing
patient
referral
with
information
for
partners
was
as
effective
as
patient
delivered
partner
therapy
Neither
strategy
was
effective
in
women
with
trichomoniasis
Two
trials
found
that
providing
index
patients
with
chlamydia
with
sampling
kits
for
their
partners
increased
the
number
of
partners
who
got
treated
Involving
index
patients
in
shared
responsibility
for
the
management
of
sexual
partners
improves
outcomes
Health
professionals
should
consider
the
following
strategies
for
the
management
of
individual
patients
patient
delivered
partner
therapy
home
sampling
for
partners
and
providing
additional
information
for
partners
