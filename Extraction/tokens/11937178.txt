Abstract
Text
Blood
pressure
reduction
achieved
with
beta-blockers
and
diuretics
is
the
best
recorded
intervention
to
date
for
prevention
of
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
death
in
patients
with
hypertension
Left
ventricular
hypertrophy
(LVH)
is
a
strong
independent
indicator
of
risk
of
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
death
We
aimed
to
establish
whether
selective
blocking
of
angiotensin
II
improves
LVH
beyond
reducing
blood
pressure
and
consequently
reduces
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
death
We
did
a
double-masked
randomised
parallel-group
trial
in
9193
participants
aged
55-80
years
with
essential
hypertension
(sitting
blood
pressure
160-200/95-115
mm
Hg)
and
LVH
ascertained
by
electrocardiography
(ECG)
We
assigned
participants
once
daily
losartan-based
or
atenolol-based
antihypertensive
treatment
for
at
least
4
years
and
until
1040
patients
had
a
primary
cardiovascular
event
(death
myocardial
infarction
or
stroke)
We
used
Cox
regression
analysis
to
compare
regimens
Blood
pressure
fell
by
302/166
(SD
185/101)
and
291/168
mm
Hg
(192/101)
in
the
losartan
and
atenolol
groups
respectively
The
primary
composite
endpoint
occurred
in
508
losartan
(238
per
1000
patient-years)
and
588
atenolol
patients
(279
per
1000
patient-years
relative
risk
087
95%
CI
077-098
p=0021)
204
losartan
and
234
atenolol
patients
died
from
cardiovascular
disease
(089
073-107
p=0206)
232
and
309
respectively
had
fatal
or
non-fatal
stroke
(075
063-089
p=0001)
and
myocardial
infarction
(non-fatal
and
fatal)
occurred
in
198
and
188
respectively
(107
088-131
p=0491)
New-onset
diabetes
was
less
frequent
with
losartan
Interpretation
Losartan
prevents
more
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
death
than
atenolol
for
a
similar
reduction
in
blood
pressure
and
is
better
tolerated
Losartan
seems
to
confer
benefits
beyond
reduction
in
blood
pressure
