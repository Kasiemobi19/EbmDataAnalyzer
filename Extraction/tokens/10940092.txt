Effectiveness
of
amitriptyline
in
the
prophylactic

of
childhood
headaches
Abstract
Text
To
study
the
effectiveness
of
a
standardized
dose
of
amitriptyline
1
mg/kg
for
childhood
headaches
Amitriptyline
has
been
shown
to
be
effective
for
the
prophylaxis
of
migraine
in
adults
Studies
in
children
however
have
been
quite
limited
In
adults
the
suggested
effective
dose
range
is
10
to
150
mg
In
children
a
standardized
dosage
is
often
not
used
resulting
in
a
dosage
range
in
clinical
practice
that
often
varies
from
a
very
low
dose
to
a
dose
equivalent
to
that
used
in
adults
Children
with
more
than
three
headaches
per
month
were
treated
with
amitriptyline
slowly
increasing
the
dose
to
1
mg/kg
per
day
The
frequency
severity
and
duration
of
their
headaches
were
initially
evaluated
and
subsequently
measured
at
each
follow-up
evaluation
Two
hundred
seventy-nine
children
had
headaches
occurring
frequently
enough
to
indicate
prophylactic
treatment
Of
these
children
192
(688%)
were
treated
with
amitriptyline
The
average
age
at
presentation
was
120
(+/-
30)
years
The
ratio
of
boys
to
girls
was
1174
The
average
frequency
of
headaches
was
171
(+/-
101)
days
per
month
The
average
severity
was
684
(+/-
167)
on
a
10-point
pain
scale
The
average
duration
was
115
(+/-
150)
hours
The
most
frequent
diagnoses
using
International
Headache
Society
criteria
were
migraine
(606%)
migraine
with
aura
(79%)
and
tension-type
headache
(104%)
Of
these
children
146
have
been
seen
for
at
least
one
follow-up
examination
occurring
on
average
673
(+/-
323)
days
after
beginning
prophylactic
treatment
A
total
of
842%
of
the
children
reported
an
overall
perception
of
being
better
while
116%
reported
being
the
same
The
frequency
of
headaches
improved
to
92
(+/-
100)
days
per
month
The
average
severity
was
reduced
to
51
(+/-
21)
and
the
average
duration
was
reduced
to
63
(+/-
111)
hours
If
daily
or
continuous
headaches
were
excluded
the
improvements
were
more
marked
Minimal
side
effects
were
reported
from
these
children
and
their
families
Long-term
evaluation
(156
to
415
days)
showed
continued
sustained
improvement
Amitriptyline
is
an
effective
prophylactic
medication
for
children
with
frequent
headaches
A
standardized
dosing
regimen
results
in
a
significant
number
of
children
responding
with
minimal
side
effects
The
children
are
able
to
tolerate
this
dosing
scheme
and
demonstrate
good
adherence
to
a
dosing
schedule
of
once
a
day
