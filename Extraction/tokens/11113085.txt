Pentoxifylline
improves
short-term

in
severe
acute

a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
An
earlier
pilot
study
from
our
liver
unit
suggested
benefit
from
treatment
with
pentoxifylline
(PTX)
an
inhibitor
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
(TNF)
in
severe
acute
alcoholic
hepatitis
The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
this
treatment
in
a
larger
cohort
of
patients
One
hundred
one
patients
with
severe
alcoholic
hepatitis
(Maddrey
discriminant
factor
>
or
=
32)
entered
a
4-week
double-blind
randomized
trial
of
PTX
(400
mg
orally
3
times
daily)
vs
placebo
Primary
endpoints
of
the
study
were
the
effect
of
PTX
on
(1)
short-term
survival
and
(2)
progression
to
hepatorenal
syndrome
On
randomization
there
were
no
differences
in
demographic
and
clinical
characteristics
or
laboratory
values
(including
TNF)
between
the
2
groups
Twelve
(245%)
of
the
49
patients
who
received
PTX
and
24
(461%)
of
the
52
patients
who
received
placebo
died
during
the
index
hospitalization
(P
=
0037
relative
risk
059
95%
confidence
interval
035-097)
Hepatorenal
syndrome
was
the
cause
of
death
in
6
(50%)
and
22
(917%)
patients
(P
=
0009
relative
risk
029
95%
confidence
interval
013-065)
Three
variables
(age
creatinine
level
on
randomization
and
treatment
with
PTX)
were
independently
associated
with
survival
TNF
values
on
randomization
were
not
predictive
of
survival
however
during
the
study
period
they
increased
markedly
in
nonsurvivors
compared
with
survivors
in
both
groups
Treatment
with
PTX
improves
short-term
survival
in
patients
with
severe
alcoholic
hepatitis
The
benefit
appears
to
be
related
to
a
significant
decrease
in
the
risk
of
developing
hepatorenal
syndrome
Increasing
TNF
levels
during
the
hospital
course
are
associated
with
an
increase
in
mortality
rate
