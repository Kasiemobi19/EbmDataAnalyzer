in
adolescent
athletes
Retrospective
study
of
incidence
and
duration
Abstract
Text
During
the
period
of
1976
to
1981
a
total
of
412
young
athletes
contacted
the
Turku
Sports
Medical
Research
Unit's
(TSMRU)
Outpatient
Sports
Clinic
with
586
complaints
These
records
included
68
athletes
with
Osgood-Schlatter's
disease
(OSD)
who
were
initially
prescribed
an
average
of
2
months'
rest
from
any
physical
activity
causing
pain
Symptoms
of
tibial
tuberosity
pain
occurred
first
at
the
average
age
of
131
years
According
to
the
retrospective
questionnaire
the
pain
caused
complete
cessation
of
training
for
an
average
of
32
months
and
the
disease
interfered
with
fully
effective
training
for
an
average
of
73
months
According
to
a
retrospective
questionnaire
given
to
389
students
(191
girls
and
198
boys)
50
(129%)
had
suffered
from
OSD
Nearly
one-half
of
the
students
193
(496%)
had
been
active
in
sports
at
the
age
of
13
and
41
(212%)
of
them
had
suffered
from
OSD
In
those
students
who
were
not
active
in
sports
the
incidence
was
only
nine
(45%
P
less
than
0001)
The
incidence
(32%)
was
higher
in
the
siblings
of
the
OSD
patients
of
TSMRU
who
were
active
in
sports
than
in
the
corresponding
student
group
(212%)
In
a
group
of
22
patients
from
the
TSMRU
who
had
suffered
from
Sever's
disease
(calcaneal
apophysitis)
the
incidence
of
OSD
(68%)
was
significantly
higher
than
in
students
who
were
active
in
sports
(P
less
than
0001)
