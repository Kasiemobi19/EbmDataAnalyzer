Abstract
Text
Meningitis
is
a
substantial
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
neonates
Clinicians
frequently
use
the
presence
of
positive
blood
cultures
to
determine
whether
neonates
should
undergo
lumbar
puncture
Abnormal
cerebrospinal
fluid
(CSF)
parameters
are
often
used
to
predict
neonatal
meningitis
and
determine
length
and
type
of
antibiotic
therapy
in
neonates
with
a
positive
blood
culture
and
negative
CSF
culture
We
evaluated
the
first
lumbar
puncture
of
9111
neonates
at
>
or
=34
weeks'
estimated
gestational
age
from
150
NICUs
managed
by
the
Pediatrix
Medical
Group
Inc
CSF
culture
results
were
compared
with
results
of
blood
cultures
and
CSF
parameters
(white
blood
cells
[WBCs]
glucose
and
protein)
to
establish
the
concordance
of
these
values
in
culture-proven
meningitis
CSF
cultures
positive
for
coagulase-negative
staphylococci
and
other
probable
contaminants
as
well
as
fungal
and
viral
pathogens
were
excluded
from
analyses
Meningitis
was
confirmed
by
culture
in
95
(10%)
neonates
Of
the
95
patients
with
meningitis
92
had
a
documented
blood
culture
Only
57
(62%)
of
92
patients
had
a
concomitant-positive
blood
culture
35
(38%)
of
92
had
a
negative
blood
culture
In
neonates
with
both
positive
blood
and
CSF
cultures
the
organisms
isolated
were
discordant
in
2
(35%)
of
57
cases
In
each
case
the
CSF
pathogen
required
different
antimicrobial
therapy
than
the
blood
pathogen
For
culture-proven
meningitis
CSF
WBC
counts
of
>0
cells
per
mm3
had
sensitivity
at
97%
and
specificity
at
11%
CSF
WBC
counts
of
>21
cells
per
mm3
had
sensitivity
at
79%
and
specificity
at
81%
Culture-proven
meningitis
was
not
diagnosed
accurately
by
CSF
glucose
or
by
protein
Neonatal
meningitis
frequently
occurs
in
the
absence
of
bacteremia
and
in
the
presence
of
normal
CSF
parameters
No
single
CSF
value
can
reliably
exclude
the
presence
of
meningitis
in
neonates
The
CSF
culture
is
critical
to
establishing
the
diagnosis
of
neonatal
meningitis
