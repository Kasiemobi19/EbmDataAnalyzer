The
underlying

follow-up
in
Taiwanese
children
screened

urinalysis
Abstract
Text
To
date
the
underlying
diseases
and
follow-up
of
Taiwanese
children
screened
by
urinalysis
have
not
been
reported
The
grading
of
urine
abnormalities
varied
from
grade
A
(microscopic
hematuria
only)
grade
B
(light
proteinuria
only)
grade
C
(light
proteinuria
and
microscopic
hematuria)
to
grade
D
(heavy
proteinuria)
From
January
1991
to
August
1998
630
students
aged
6-15
years
and
with
positive
urinary
screening
were
admitted
to
our
hospital
for
further
evaluation
Of
these
573
students
had
confirmed
abnormal
findings
298
were
boys
275
were
girls
and
294
students
received
a
renal
biopsy
and
have
had
regular
follow-up
visits
This
study
was
designed
to
retrospectively
elucidate
(1)
the
relationship
between
grading
of
urine
abnormality
and
underlying
disease
(2)
the
relationships
among
hypertension
grading
of
urine
abnormality
and
underlying
disease
(3)
the
underlying
disease
of
low
serum
C3
level
and
(4)
to
determine
whether
urinary
screening
progressively
decreased
the
number
of
students
with
end-stage
renal
disease
(ESRD)
annually
The
results
show
that
glomerular
nephritis
(GN)
is
still
one
of
the
major
causes
of
urinary
abnormalities
The
most-important
secondary
GN
was
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(SLE)
with
lupus
nephritis
One-quarter
of
the
patients
fulfilled
at
least
four
of
the
revised
American
Rheumatology
Association
(ARA)
criteria
for
SLE
at
first
administration
while
the
others
who
fulfilled
only
two
to
three
of
the
revised
ARA
criteria
had
gradually
developing
signs
and
symptoms
of
SLE
at
follow-up
The
percentage
of
SLE
patients
amongst
anti-nuclear
antibody
(ANA)
positive
children
was
72%
Membranoproliferative
GN
is
very
rare
The
distribution
of
hypertension
was
82%
in
grade
A
107%
in
grade
B
97%
in
grade
C
and
289%
in
grade
D
urinary
abnormality
There
were
statistical
differences
between
grade
D
and
either
grade
A
or
B
or
C
(P<005)
Lower
serum
C3
levels
were
found
only
in
a
minority
of
patients
including
those
with
SLE
In
this
series
focal
segmental
glomerular
sclerosis
(FSGS)
and
active
class
IV
lupus
nephritis
patients
were
found
early
enough
to
receive
methylprednisolone
pulse
plus
cyclosporine
A
therapy
To
date
there
have
been
only
2
cases
(5%)
of
FSGS
with
impaired
renal
function
and
none
of
the
lupus
nephritis
patients
are
in
the
predialysis
stage
In
conclusion
GN
is
still
the
major
cause
of
urinary
screening
abnormality
ANA
study
is
indicated
in
all
Chinese
students
with
abnormal
urinary
screening
The
correlations
between
the
severity
of
proteinuria
and
hypertension
showed
more-severe
proteinuria
in
patients
with
nephritis
as
well
as
in
those
with
hypertension
