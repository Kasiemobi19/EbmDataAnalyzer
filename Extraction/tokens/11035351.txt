Maternal
and
neonatal
outcomes
after
induction
of
labor
without
an
identified
indication
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
undertaken
to
examine
associations
between
induction
of
labor
and
maternal
and
neonatal
outcomes
among
women
without
an
identified
indication
for
induction
This
was
a
population-based
cohort
study
of
2886
women
with
induced
labor
and
9648
women
with
spontaneous
labor
who
were
delivered
at
37
to
41
weeks'
gestation
all
without
identified
medical
and
obstetric
indications
for
induction
Among
nulliparous
women
19%
of
women
with
induced
labor
versus
10%
of
those
with
spontaneous
labor
underwent
cesarean
delivery
(adjusted
relative
risk
177
95%
confidence
interval
150-208)
No
association
was
seen
in
multiparous
women
(relative
risk
107
95%
confidence
interval
0
81-139)
Among
all
women
induction
was
associated
with
modest
increases
in
instrumental
delivery
(19%
vs
15%
relative
risk
120
95%
confidence
interval
109-132)
and
shoulder
dystocia
(30%
vs
1
7%
relative
risk
132
95%
confidence
interval
102-169)
Among
women
who
lacked
an
identified
indication
for
induction
of
labor
induction
was
associated
with
increased
likelihood
of
cesarean
delivery
for
nulliparous
but
not
multiparous
women
and
with
modest
increases
in
the
risk
of
instrumental
delivery
and
shoulder
dystocia
for
all
women
