J-shaped
relationship

and

in
hypertensive
patients
new

Abstract
Text
Population-based
longitudinal
studies
of
hypertension
have
usually
shown
a
continuous
and
positive
relationship
between
blood
pressure
and
mortality
However
several
studies
in
hypertensive
patients
receiving
treatment
have
described
this
relationship
as
J-shaped
with
an
increased
risk
for
events
in
patients
with
low
blood
pressure
To
assess
the
evidence
for
a
J-shaped
relationship
between
blood
pressure
and
mortality
and
its
relation
to
treatment
Meta-analysis
of
individual-patient
data
Seven
randomized
clinical
trials
from
the
INDANA
(INdividual
Data
ANalysis
of
Antihypertensive
intervention)
database
40
233
persons
with
hypertension
(mean
follow-up
39
years)
Primarily
beta-blockers
or
thiazide
diuretics
versus
placebo
or
no
treatment
Diastolic
and
systolic
blood
pressure
and
number
of
cardiovascular
noncardiovascular
and
all-cause
deaths
in
yearly
periods
of
follow-up
The
analysis
included
data
on
1655
deaths
(56%
cardiovascular)
A
J-shaped
relationship
between
diastolic
blood
pressure
and
risk
for
death
was
observed
for
total
and
cardiovascular
mortality
in
treated
patients
(nadir
84
and
80
mm
Hg
respectively)
and
untreated
patients
(nadir
90
and
85
mm
Hg
respectively)
For
noncardiovascular
deaths
the
relationship
was
J-shaped
in
the
treated
group
(nadir
84
mm
Hg)
and
negative
in
the
control
group
Similar
results
were
observed
for
systolic
blood
pressure
The
presence
of
patients
with
wide
pulse
pressure
did
not
explain
these
findings
The
increased
risk
for
events
observed
in
patients
with
low
blood
pressure
was
not
related
to
antihypertensive
treatment
and
was
not
specific
to
blood
pressure-related
events
Poor
health
conditions
leading
to
low
blood
pressure
and
an
increased
risk
for
death
probably
explain
the
J-shaped
curve
