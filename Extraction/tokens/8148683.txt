Clinical
course
and
prognostic
factors
in
acute
low
back
pain
an

cohort
study
in
primary
care
practice
Abstract
Text
To
describe
the
natural
course
of
recent
acute
low
back
pain
in
terms
of
both
morbidity
(pain
disability)
and
absenteeism
from
work
and
to
evaluate
the
prognostic
factors
for
these
outcomes
Inception
cohort
study
Primary
care
103
patients
with
acute
localised
non-specific
back
pain
lasting
less
than
72
hours
Complete
recovery
(disappearance
of
both
pain
and
disability)
and
return
to
work
90%
of
patients
recovered
within
two
weeks
and
only
two
developed
chronic
low
back
pain
Only
49
of
100
patients
for
whom
data
were
available
had
bed
rest
and
40%
of
75
employed
patients
lost
no
time
from
work
Proportional
hazards
regression
analysis
showed
that
previous
chronic
episodes
of
low
back
pain
initial
disability
level
initial
pain
worse
when
standing
initial
pain
worse
when
lying
and
compensation
status
were
significantly
associated
with
delayed
episode
recovery
These
factors
were
also
related
to
absenteeism
from
work
Absenteeism
from
work
was
also
influenced
by
job
satisfaction
and
gender
The
recovery
rate
from
acute
low
back
pain
was
much
higher
than
reported
in
other
studies
Those
studies
however
did
not
investigate
groups
of
patients
enrolled
shortly
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
and
often
mixed
acute
low
back
pain
patients
with
patients
with
exacerbations
of
chronic
pain
or
sciatica
Several
sociodemographic
and
clinical
factors
were
of
prognostic
value
in
acute
low
back
pain
Factors
which
influenced
the
outcome
in
terms
of
episode
recovery
(mainly
physical
severity
factors)
were
only
partly
predictive
of
absenteeism
from
work
Time
off
work
and
return
to
work
depended
more
on
sociodemographic
and
job
related
influences
