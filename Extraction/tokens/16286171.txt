Pleiotropic
effects
of
statins
benefit
beyond
cholesterol
reduction
A
meta-regression
analysis
Abstract
Text
This
study
sought
to
determine
whether
statins
reduce
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
risk
more
than
other
interventions
that
also
primarily
lower
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C)
Statins
have
anti-inflammatory
immunomodulatory
antithrombotic
vascular
and
other
non-LDL-C-lowering
effects
It
is
unclear
whether
these
pleiotropic
effects
contribute
to
cardiovascular
risk
reduction
beyond
that
expected
from
LDL-C
reduction
alone
Trials
published
in
English
language
journals
were
retrieved
by
searching
Medline
(1966
to
October
2004)
bibliographies
and
the
author's
reference
files
Randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
of
interventions
to
primarily
lower
LDL-C
of
three
or
more
years'
duration
in
which
clinical
disease
or
death
were
primary
outcomes
were
used
Information
on
sample
size
treatment
type
and
duration
participant
characteristics
at
baseline
reduction
in
lipids
and
outcome
was
independently
abstracted
by
two
authors
(JR
and
NM)
using
a
standardized
protocol
Data
from
5
diet
3
bile
acid
sequestrant
1
surgery
and
10
statin
trials
with
81859
participants
were
included
in
the
CHD
meta-regression
analysis
The
regression
lines
for
non-statin
and
statin
trials
were
similar
and
consistent
with
a
one-to-one
relationship
between
LDL-C
lowering
and
CHD
and
stroke
reduction
over
five
years
of
treatment
The
pleiotropic
effects
of
statins
do
not
seem
to
contribute
an
additional
cardiovascular
risk
reduction
benefit
beyond
that
expected
from
the
degree
of
LDL-C
lowering
observed
in
other
trials
that
primarily
lowered
LDL-C
