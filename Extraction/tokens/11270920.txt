Comparing
guanfacine
and
dextroamphetamine
for
the
treatment
of
adult
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
Abstract
Text
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
efficacy
of
the
alpha-2a
agonist
guanfacine
with
that
of
dextroamphetamine
for
the
treatment
of
adult
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
Seventeen
adult
outpatients
who
met
DSM-IV
criteria
for
ADHD
participated
in
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
crossover
study
comparing
drug
effects
on
ADHD
symptoms
Measures
of
change
included
the
DSM-IV
ADHD
Behavior
Checklist
for
Adults
and
the
Copeland
Symptom
Checklist
for
Adult
Attention
Deficit
Disorders
Cognitive
measures
of
attention
included
the
Stroop
and
Controlled
Oral
Word
Association
Test
using
the
letters
"C"
"F"
and
"L"
(COWAT
CFL
version)
For
each
trial
the
drug
was
administered
daily
and
titered
up
to
optimal
doses
of
maximum
efficacy
but
with
a
minimum
of
side
effects
and
then
data
were
collected
Both
drugs
significantly
reduced
ADHD
symptoms
on
the
DSM-IV
Adult
Behavior
Checklist
for
Adults
over
placebo
(p
<
005)
The
Stroop
Color
subscale
showed
significant
improvement
for
both
drugs
(p
<
005)
but
the
Color-Word
measures
showed
significant
improvement
for
guanfacine
only
(p
<
001)
The
average
dose
of
guanfacine
was
110
(SD
=
060)
and
the
most
common
side
effect
of
guanfacine
was
fatigue
No
subjects
discontinued
drug
trials
This
preliminary
study
indicates
that
guanfacine
may
be
a
well-tolerated
treatment
option
for
adult
ADHD
