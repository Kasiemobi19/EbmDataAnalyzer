Atenolol
in
hypertension
is
it
a
wise
choice
Abstract
Text
Atenolol
is
one
of
the
most
widely
used
beta
blockers
clinically
and
has
often
been
used
as
a
reference
drug
in
randomised
controlled
trials
of
hypertension
However
questions
have
been
raised
about
atenolol
as
the
best
reference
drug
for
comparisons
with
other
antihypertensives
Thus
our
aim
was
to
systematically
review
the
effect
of
atenolol
on
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
in
hypertensive
patients
Reports
were
identified
through
searches
of
The
Cochrane
Library
MEDLINE
relevant
textbooks
and
by
personal
communication
with
established
researchers
in
hypertension
Randomised
controlled
trials
that
assessed
the
effect
of
atenolol
on
cardiovascular
morbidity
or
mortality
in
patients
with
primary
hypertension
were
included
We
identified
four
studies
that
compared
atenolol
with
placebo
or
no
treatment
and
five
that
compared
atenolol
with
other
antihypertensive
drugs
Despite
major
differences
in
blood
pressure
lowering
there
were
no
outcome
differences
between
atenolol
and
placebo
in
the
four
studies
comprising
6825
patients
who
were
followed
up
for
a
mean
of
46
years
on
all-cause
mortality
(relative
risk
101
[95%
CI
089-115])
cardiovascular
mortality
(099
[083-118])
or
myocardial
infarction
(099
[083-119])
The
risk
of
stroke
however
tended
to
be
lower
in
the
atenolol
than
in
the
placebo
group
(085
[072-101])
When
atenolol
was
compared
with
other
antihypertensives
there
were
no
major
differences
in
blood
pressure
lowering
between
the
treatment
arms
Our
meta-analysis
showed
a
significantly
higher
mortality
(113
[102-125])
with
atenolol
treatment
than
with
other
active
treatment
in
the
five
studies
comprising
17671
patients
who
were
followed
up
for
a
mean
of
46
years
Moreover
cardiovascular
mortality
also
tended
to
be
higher
with
atenolol
treatment
than
with
other
antihypertensive
treatment
Stroke
was
also
more
frequent
with
atenolol
treatment
Our
results
cast
doubts
on
atenolol
as
a
suitable
drug
for
hypertensive
patients
Moreover
they
challenge
the
use
of
atenolol
as
a
reference
drug
in
outcome
trials
in
hypertension
