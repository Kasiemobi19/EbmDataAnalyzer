Title
Can
history
and
physical
examination
reliably
diagnose
pediatric
obstructive

A
systematic

Abstract
Text
Using
an
evidence-based
technique
systematically
review
the
literature
to
evaluate
the
accuracy
of
routine
clinical
history
and
physical
examination
in
the
diagnosis
of
obstructive
sleep
apnea/hypopnea
syndrome
(OSAHS)
in
the
pediatric
patient
The
biomedical
literature
was
systematically
reviewed
Articles
comparing
the
results
of
clinical
evaluation
to
polysomnography
(PSG)
were
selected
The
level
of
evidence
was
assessed
using
established
evidence-based
medicine
(EBM)
guidelines
Twelve
articles
were
identified
using
the
search
criteria
Eleven
of
12
articles
concluded
that
clinical
evaluation
is
inaccurate
in
the
diagnosis
of
OSAHS
The
level
of
evidence
was
good
to
very
good
(Grade
B/B+)
Clinical
history
and
physical
examination
are
not
reliable
for
diagnosing
OSAHS
compared
with
overnight
PSG
Complicating
the
interpretation
of
this
work
is
the
lack
of
a
validated
PSG
threshold
of
clinically
significant
disease
There
is
an
urgent
need
for
the
development
of
adequate
screening
tests
with
validated
clinical
outcomes
