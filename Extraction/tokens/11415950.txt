Measures
of
menopausal
status

demographic
reproductive
and
behavioral
characteristics
in
a
population-based

of

Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
cross-sectional
analysis
of
women
aged
35-49
years
from
the
Third
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
conducted
between
1988
and
1994
was
to
assess
associations
with
menopausal
status
based
either
on
menstrual
cycle
patterns
or
on
elevated
(>20
IU/liter)
follicle-stimulating
hormone
Menstrual
cycle-based
menopausal
status
was
defined
for
women
who
had
not
had
surgical
menopause
by
months
since
the
last
period
(<2
2-12
and
>12
months
for
pre-
peri-
and
postmenopause
respectively)
Logistic
regression
was
adjusted
for
age
smoking
and
unilateral
oophorectomy
Higher
body
mass
index
(>
or
=30
kg/m(2)
compared
with
<
250
kg/m(2))
was
associated
with
a
lower
likelihood
of
elevated
follicle-stimulating
hormone
(odds
ratio
(OR)=06
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
04
09)
but
this
association
was
not
seen
with
the
menstrual
measure
of
menopause
Exercise
(three
or
more
times
per
week)
was
associated
with
a
lower
likelihood
of
being
postmenopausal
on
the
basis
of
menstrual
(OR
=
03
95%
CI
02
07)
and
hormonal
(OR
=
06
95%
CI
04
10)
measures
Alcohol
use
also
tended
to
be
associated
with
postmenopausal
status
by
either
measure
but
not
significantly
so
There
was
little
evidence
of
associations
with
ethnicity
education
age
at
menarche
number
of
livebirths
and
oral
contraceptive
use
Menstrual-based
definitions
of
menopause
can
be
misclassified
for
women
with
menstrual
irregularity
This
might
explain
why
obese
women
were
classified
menstrually
as
menopausal
while
remaining
hormonally
premenopausal
