The
effects
of
stress
anxiety
and
outdoor
temperature
on
the
frequency
and
severity
of
Raynaud's
attacks
the
Raynaud's
Treatment
Study
Abstract
Text
It
was
expected
that
stress
and
anxiety
would
be
related
to
Raynaud's
phenomenon
(RP)
attack
characteristics
when
mild
outdoor
temperatures
produced
partial
or
no
digital
vasoconstriction
Hypotheses
were
that
in
warmer
temperature
categories
compared
to
those
below
40
degrees
F
higher
stress
or
anxiety
would
be
associated
with
more
frequent
severe
and
painful
attacks
The
Raynaud's
Treatment
Study
recruited
313
participants
with
primary
RP
Outcomes
were
attack
rate
severity
and
pain
Predictors
were
average
daily
outdoor
temperature
stress
anxiety
age
gender
and
a
stress-by-temperature
or
an
anxiety-by-temperature
interaction
Outcomes
were
tested
separately
in
multiple
linear
regression
models
Stress
and
anxiety
were
tested
in
separate
models
Stress
was
not
a
significant
predictor
of
RP
attack
characteristics
Higher
anxiety
was
related
to
more
frequent
attacks
above
60
degrees
F
It
was
also
related
to
greater
attack
severity
at
all
temperatures
and
to
greater
pain
above
60
degrees
F
and
between
40
degrees
and
499
degrees
F
