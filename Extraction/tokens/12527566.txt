Screening

a

literature
Abstract
Text
To
review
the
available
data
on
the
early
detection
of
lung
cancer
with
a
focus
on
three
technologies
chest
x-ray
(CXR)
sputum
cytology
and
low-dose
CT
(LDCT)
scanning
Review
of
published
clinical
studies
of
early
detection
technologies
The
best
available
evidence
on
each
topic
was
selected
for
analysis
Randomized
trials
were
used
to
evaluate
CXR
and
sputum
cytology
Cohort
studies
as
well
as
studies
providing
evidence
regarding
rates
of
overdiagnosis
and
efficacy
of
initial
treatment
were
considered
in
evaluation
of
LDCT
Study
design
and
results
were
summarized
in
evidence
tables
Statistical
analyses
of
combined
data
were
not
performed
Five
randomized
trials
of
CXR
with
or
without
sputum
cytology
have
been
conducted
each
which
reports
disease-specific
mortality
as
well
as
other
end
points
None
of
these
studies
provide
support
for
the
use
of
either
CXR
or
sputum
cytology
for
the
early
detection
of
lung
cancer
in
asymptomatic
individuals
Eight
completed
and
ongoing
trials
of
LDCT
were
identified
All
of
these
studies
report
the
frequency
and
stage
distribution
of
lung
cancers
found
during
initial
("prevalence")
screening
and
several
studies
also
report
rates
of
detection
at
the
time
of
annual
follow-up
No
outcome
data
on
survival
or
treatment
are
available
A
number
of
studies
support
the
hypothesis
of
"overdiagnosis"--that
some
lung
cancers
detected
by
LDCT
may
behave
in
an
indolent
manner
The
use
of
either
CXR
or
sputum
cytology
for
the
early
detection
of
lung
cancer
is
not
supported
by
the
published
evidence
The
evidence
for
LDCT
appears
promising
in
that
the
technology
typically
identifies
lung
cancer
at
an
early
stage
although
corollary
studies
suggest
that
these
findings
in
isolation
may
be
misleading
Further
high-quality
research
is
needed
to
better
define
the
role
of
LDCT
in
the
evaluation
of
asymptomatic
high-risk
individuals
