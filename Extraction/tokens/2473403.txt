Abstract
Text
The
occurrence
of
ventricular
premature
depolarizations
in
survivors
of
myocardial
infarction
is
a
risk
factor
for
subsequent
sudden
death
but
whether
antiarrhythmic
therapy
reduces
the
risk
is
not
known
The
Cardiac
Arrhythmia
Suppression
Trial
(CAST)
is
evaluating
the
effect
of
antiarrhythmic
therapy
(encainide
flecainide
or
moricizine)
in
patients
with
asymptomatic
or
mildly
symptomatic
ventricular
arrhythmia
(six
or
more
ventricular
premature
beats
per
hour)
after
myocardial
infarction
As
of
March
30
1989
2309
patients
had
been
recruited
for
the
initial
drug-titration
phase
of
the
study
1727
(75
percent)
had
initial
suppression
of
their
arrhythmia
(as
assessed
by
Holter
recording)
through
the
use
of
one
of
the
three
study
drugs
and
had
been
randomly
assigned
to
receive
active
drug
or
placebo
During
an
average
of
10
months
of
follow-up
the
patients
treated
with
active
drug
had
a
higher
rate
of
death
from
arrhythmia
than
the
patients
assigned
to
placebo
Encainide
and
flecainide
accounted
for
the
excess
of
deaths
from
arrhythmia
and
nonfatal
cardiac
arrests
(33
of
730
patients
taking
encainide
or
flecainide
[45
percent]
9
of
725
taking
placebo
[12
percent]
relative
risk
36
95
percent
confidence
interval
17
to
85)
They
also
accounted
for
the
higher
total
mortality
(56
of
730
[77
percent]
and
22
of
725
[30
percent]
respectively
relative
risk
25
95
percent
confidence
interval
16
to
45)
Because
of
these
results
the
part
of
the
trial
involving
encainide
and
flecainide
has
been
discontinued
We
conclude
that
neither
encainide
nor
flecainide
should
be
used
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
asymptomatic
or
minimally
symptomatic
ventricular
arrhythmia
after
myocardial
infarction
even
though
these
drugs
may
be
effective
initially
in
suppressing
ventricular
arrhythmia
Whether
these
results
apply
to
other
patients
who
might
be
candidates
for
antiarrhythmic
therapy
is
unknown
