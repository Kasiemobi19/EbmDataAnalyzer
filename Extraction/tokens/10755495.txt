Title
Effect
of
metformin
and
rosiglitazone
combination
therapy
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Most
antidiabetic
agents
target
only
1
of
several
underlying
causes
of
diabetes
The
complementary
actions
of
the
antidiabetic
agents
metformin
hydrochloride
and
rosiglitazone
maleate
may
maintain
optimal
glycemic
control
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
therefore
their
combined
use
may
be
indicated
for
patients
whose
diabetes
is
poorly
controlled
by
metformin
alone
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
metformin-rosiglitazone
therapy
in
patients
whose
type
2
diabetes
is
inadequately
controlled
with
metformin
alone
Randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
from
April
1997
and
March
1998
Thirty-six
outpatient
centers
in
the
United
States
Three
hundred
forty-eight
patients
aged
40
to
80
years
with
a
mean
fasting
plasma
glucose
level
of
120
mmol/L
(216
mg/dL)
a
mean
glycosylated
hemoglobin
level
of
88%
and
a
mean
body
mass
index
of
301
kg/m2
were
randomized
Patients
were
assigned
to
receive
25
g/d
of
metformin
plus
placebo
(n
=
116)
25
g/d
of
metformin
plus
4
mg/d
of
rosiglitazone
(n
=
119)
or
25
g/d
of
metformin
and
8
mg/d
of
rosiglitazone
(n
=
113)
for
26
weeks
Glycosylated
hemoglobin
levels
fasting
plasma
glucose
levels
insulin
sensitivity
and
beta-cell
function
compared
between
baseline
and
week
26
by
treatment
group
Glycosylated
hemoglobin
levels
fasting
plasma
glucose
levels
insulin
sensitivity
and
beta-cell
function
improved
significantly
with
metformin-rosiglitazone
therapy
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
The
mean
levels
of
glycosylated
hemoglobin
decreased
by
10%
in
the
4
mg/d
metformin-rosiglitazone
group
and
by
12%
in
the
8
mg/d
metformin-rosiglitazone
group
and
fasting
plasma
glucose
levels
by
22
mmol/L
(398
mg/dL)
and
29
mmol/L
(529
mg/dL)
compared
with
the
metformin-placebo
group
(P<001
for
all)
Of
patients
receiving
8
mg/d
of
metformin-rosiglitazone
281%
achieved
a
glycosylated
hemoglobin
level
of
7%
or
less
[corrected]
Dose-dependent
increases
in
body
weight
and
total
and
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
were
observed
(P<001
for
both
rosiglitazone
groups
vs
placebo)
The
proportion
of
patients
reporting
adverse
experiences
was
comparable
across
all
groups
Our
data
suggest
that
combination
treatment
with
once-daily
metformin-rosiglitazone
improves
glycemic
control
insulin
sensitivity
and
beta-cell
function
more
effectively
than
treatment
with
metformin
alone
