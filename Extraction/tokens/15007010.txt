Abstract
Text
Regular
exercise
in
patients
with
stable
coronary
artery
disease
has
been
shown
to
improve
myocardial
perfusion
and
to
retard
disease
progression
We
therefore
conducted
a
randomized
study
to
compare
the
effects
of
exercise
training
versus
standard
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
(PCI)
with
stenting
on
clinical
symptoms
angina-free
exercise
capacity
myocardial
perfusion
cost-effectiveness
and
frequency
of
a
combined
clinical
end
point
(death
of
cardiac
cause
stroke
CABG
angioplasty
acute
myocardial
infarction
and
worsening
angina
with
objective
evidence
resulting
in
hospitalization)
A
total
of
101
male
patients
aged
<
or
=70
years
were
recruited
after
routine
coronary
angiography
and
randomized
to
12
months
of
exercise
training
(20
minutes
of
bicycle
ergometry
per
day)
or
to
PCI
Cost
efficiency
was
calculated
as
the
average
expense
(in
US
dollars)
needed
to
improve
the
Canadian
Cardiovascular
Society
class
by
1
class
Exercise
training
was
associated
with
a
higher
event-free
survival
(88%
versus
70%
in
the
PCI
group
P=0023)
and
increased
maximal
oxygen
uptake
(+16%
from
227+/-07
to
262+/-08
mL
O2/kg
P<0001
versus
baseline
P<0001
versus
PCI
group
after
12
months)
To
gain
1
Canadian
Cardiovascular
Society
class
6956
dollars
was
spent
in
the
PCI
group
versus
3429
dollars
in
the
training
group
(P<0001)
Compared
with
PCI
a
12-month
program
of
regular
physical
exercise
in
selected
patients
with
stable
coronary
artery
disease
resulted
in
superior
event-free
survival
and
exercise
capacity
at
lower
costs
notably
owing
to
reduced
rehospitalizations
and
repeat
revascularizations
