Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
1-month
postpneumococcal
polysaccharide-revaccination
immunoglobulin
G
(IgG)
antibody
response
its
persistence
at
1
year
and
tolerability
of
revaccination
in
frail
chronically
ill
older
nursing
facility
residents
Prospective
study
conducted
between
December
1998
and
July
2000
Six
skilled
nursing
facilities
in
the
Minneapolis-St
Paul
Minnesota
metropolitan
area
Sixty-seven
subjects
aged
65
and
older
having
received
primary
vaccination
with
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
(PPV)
at
least
5
years
before
enrollment
Revaccination
with
one
dose
of
23-valent
PPV
Adverse
events
and
concentrations
of
seven
individual
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
type-specific
IgG
antibodies
(against
serotypes
4
6B
9V
14
18C
19F
23F)
and
their
aggregate
before
and
1
and
12
months
after
revaccination
A
significant
increase
in
all
individual
and
aggregate
median
antibody
concentrations
over
baseline
was
observed
1
month
after
revaccination
However
after
1
year
the
increase
remained
significant
only
for
serotypes
6B
and
18C
and
the
aggregate
parameter
One
month
after
revaccination
the
mean
increase
in
antibody
concentration
over
baseline
was
significantly
greater
than
14-fold
for
six
of
the
seven
serotypes
and
the
aggregate
However
the
increase
was
not
significantly
greater
than
14
at
1
year
for
any
of
the
serotypes
or
the
aggregate
Minor
self-limited
localized
adverse
reactions
and
systemic
reactions
occurred
in
113%
of
the
subjects
In
frail
chronically
ill
older
nursing
facility
residents
revaccination
with
23-valent
PPV
at
least
5
years
after
primary
vaccination
(whether
primary
vaccination
occurred
before
or
after
age
65)
is
associated
with
a
significant
albeit
brief
immunological
response
for
most
of
the
serotypes
tested
Revaccination
was
well
tolerated
