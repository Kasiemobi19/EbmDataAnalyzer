Abstract
Text
Studies
that
evaluate
the
risk
of
hepatotoxicity
from
statins
in
hyperlipidemic
subjects
with
elevated
baseline
serum
transaminases
are
lacking
We
conducted
a
study
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
patients
with
elevated
baseline
liver
enzymes
have
higher
risk
of
statin
hepatotoxicity
Our
study
consisted
of
the
following
3
cohorts
of
patients
seen
between
January
1
1998
and
June
31
2002
Cohort
1
342
hyperlipidemic
patients
with
elevated
baseline
enzymes
(AST
>40
IU/L
or
ALT
>35
IU/L)
who
were
prescribed
a
statin
cohort
2
1437
hyperlipidemic
patients
with
normal
transaminases
who
were
prescribed
a
statin
and
cohort
3
2245
patients
with
elevated
liver
enzymes
but
who
were
not
prescribed
a
statin
The
effect
of
statins
on
liver
biochemistries
was
assessed
over
a
6-month
period
after
statins
were
prescribed
Elevations
in
liver
biochemistries
during
follow-up
were
categorized
into
mild-moderate
or
severe
based
on
predefined
criteria
The
incidence
of
mild-moderate
elevations
and
severe
elevations
in
liver
biochemistries
in
cohort
1
were
47%
and
06%
respectively
Compared
with
cohort
1
individuals
in
cohort
2
had
lower
incidence
of
mild-moderate
elevations
(19%
P
=
0002)
but
not
severe
elevations
(02%
P
=
02)
However
between
cohorts
1
and
3
there
were
no
differences
in
the
incidence
of
mild-moderate
elevations
(47%
vs
64%
respectively
P
=
02)
or
severe
elevations
(06%
vs
04%
respectively
P
=
06)
Statin
discontinuation
during
the
follow-up
was
similar
between
cohorts
1
and
2
(111%
vs
107%
respectively
P
=
08)
These
data
suggest
that
individuals
with
elevated
baseline
liver
enzymes
do
not
have
higher
risk
for
hepatotoxicity
from
statins
