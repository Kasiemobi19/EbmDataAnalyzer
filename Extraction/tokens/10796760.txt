Abstract
Text
Colorectal
cancer
is
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
in
the
Western
world
In
Australia
the
United
Kingdom
and
the
United
States
it
is
the
second
commonest
cancer
for
women
after
breast
cancer
(age-standardised
incidence
22-33
per
100000)
and
men
after
prostate
or
lung
cancer
(age-standardised
incidence
31-47
per
100000)
(Jeffs
et
al
1996
Parkin
et
al
1992)
Just
under
half
of
all
persons
affected
will
die
from
their
disease
(Jeffs
et
al
1996
Parkin
et
al
1992)
The
human
and
financial
costs
of
this
disease
have
prompted
considerable
research
efforts
to
evaluate
the
ability
of
screening
tests
to
detect
the
cancer
at
an
early
curable
stage
Tests
which
have
been
considered
for
screening
include
faecal
occult
blood
tests
sigmoidoscopy
and
colonoscopy
To
determine
whether
screening
for
colorectal
cancer
using
the
faecal
occult
blood
test
Hemoccult
reduces
colorectal
cancer
mortality
and
to
consider
the
benefits
and
harms
of
screening
Published
and
unpublished
data
for
this
review
were
identified
by
*
retrieving
studies
included
in
a
systematic
review
conducted
by
some
of
the
authors
in
1995
*
searches
of
MEDLINE
Current
Contents
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
*
writing
to
trial
lists
All
controlled
trials
of
screening
for
colorectal
cancer
using
Hemoccult
were
eligible
for
inclusion
in
the
review
Data
from
the
trials
were
independently
extracted
by
two
authors
Data
analysis
was
performed
using
the
group
subjects
were
randomised
to
('intention
to
screen')
whether
or
not
they
were
ever
screened
To
estimate
the
effect
of
Hemoccult
screening
on
colorectal
cancer
mortality
we
calculated
relative
risks
and
risk
differences
for
each
trial
and
then
overall
using
fixed
and
random
effects
models
and
tested
for
heterogeneity
of
effects
We
calculated
summary
measures
of
effect
including
all
trials
and
also
for
just
the
randomised
controlled
trials
We
also
calculated
a
summary
measure
of
effect
adjusted
for
attendance
at
screening
in
each
trial
(not
shown
in
Meta-view)
Meta-analysis
of
mortality
results
from
the
randomised
controlled
trials
shows
that
those
allocated
to
screening
had
a
reduction
in
colorectal
cancer
mortality
of
16%
(RR
084
CI
077-093)
When
adjusted
for
screening
attendance
in
the
individual
studies
the
mortality
reduction
is
23%
(RR
077
CI
057-089)
Overall
if
10
000
people
were
offered
a
biennial
Hemoccult
screening
program
and
two-thirds
attended
for
at
least
one
Hemoccult
test
there
would
be
85
deaths
(CI
36-135)
from
colorectal
cancer
prevented
over
10
years
However
the
screening
program
would
also
result
in
2
800
participants
having
at
least
one
colonoscopy
if
screening
harms
from
the
Minnesota
trial
are
considered
and
there
would
be
34
colonoscopy
complications
(perforation
or
haemorrhage)
If
screening
harms
from
the
Gothenburg
trial
are
considered
approximately
600
participants
would
need
at
least
one
sigmoidoscopy
and
double
contrast
barium
enema
resulting
in
18
perforations
or
haemorrhages
Screening
benefits
include
reduction
in
colorectal
cancer
mortality
possible
reduction
in
cancer
incidence
through
detection
and
removal
of
colorectal
adenomas
and
potentially
treatment
of
early
colorectal
cancers
may
involve
less
invasive
surgery
Harmful
effects
of
screening
include
the
physical
complications
of
colonoscopy
disruption
to
lifestyle
stress
and
discomfort
of
testing
and
investigations
and
the
anxiety
caused
by
falsely
positive
screening
tests
Although
screening
benefits
are
likely
to
outweigh
harms
for
populations
at
increased
risk
of
colorectal
cancer
we
need
more
information
about
the
harmful
effects
of
screening
the
community's
responses
to
screening
and
screening
costs
for
different
health
care
systems
before
widespread
screening
can
be
recommended
