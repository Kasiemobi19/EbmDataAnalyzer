Incidence
and
prophylaxis
of
deep
venous
thrombosis
in
outpatients
with
injury
of
the
lower
limb
Abstract
Text
253
outpatients
were
included
in
a
prospective
randomized
study
All
patients
had
incidence
of
injuries
of
the
lower
limb
immobilized
by
a
plaster
cast
126
patients
(group
I)
received
a
subcutaneous
injection
of
Fraxiparin
daily
and
127
patients
(group
II)
received
no
thromboprophylaxis
Without
prophylaxis
21
(165%)
cases
developed
a
thrombosis
and
with
prophylaxis
a
thrombosis
could
be
proven
in
6
(48%)
patients
only
(p
<
001)
Thus
for
all
patients
with
an
injury
of
the
lower
limb
being
immobilized
by
a
plaster
cast
a
thromboprophylaxis
with
a
low-molecular-weight
heparin
is
recommended
