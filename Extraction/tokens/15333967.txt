Efficacy
of
omega-3
fatty
acids
atorvastatin
and
orlistat
in
non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
with
dyslipidemia
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
three
hypolipidemic
agents
in
patients
with
non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
associated
with
hyperlipidemia
Patients
with
dyslipidemia
(Fredrickson
type
IIb)
asymptomatic
persistent
transaminasemia
lasting
24
weeks
and
evidence
of
hepatic
fat
infiltration
on
ultrasonography
and
liver
biopsy
were
studied
Those
with
predominant
hypertriglyceridemia
received
omega-3
fatty
acids
(5
mL
thrice
daily)
(Group
A)
those
with
predominant
hypercholesterolemia
received
atorvastatin
20
mg/daily
(Group
B)
and
overweight
patients
received
orlistat
120
mg
thrice
daily
before
meals
(Group
C)
After
24
weeks
of
treatment
serum
transaminase
and
lipid
levels
and
liver
ultrasonography
were
repeated
Serum
transaminase
levels
decreased
significantly
(p<
0001)
in
all
groups
but
the
decrease
was
more
marked
in
Group
C
(AST
75
[16]
to
31
[7]
IU/L
ALT
120
[38]
to
41
[10]
IU/L)
than
in
Group
A
(AST
70
[14]
to
41
[6]
ALT
110
[20]
to
68
[12])
or
Group
B
(AST
68
[13]
to
46
[9]
ALT
115
[22]
to
766
[13])
After
treatment
ultrasonography
showed
resolution
of
fatty
liver
in
35%
of
patients
in
Group
A
61%
in
Group
B
and
in
86%
in
Group
C
(p<
0001
Group
C
vs
A)
A
decline
in
transaminase
levels
and
normalization
of
ultrasonographic
evidence
of
fatty
liver
were
observed
on
treatment
with
omega-3
fatty
acids
in
patients
with
hypertriglyceridemia
with
atorvastatin
in
those
with
hypercholesterolemia
and
orlistat
in
overweight
patients
with
hyperlipidemia
