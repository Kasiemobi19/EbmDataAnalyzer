Title
Effect
of
levothyroxine
on
cardiac
function
and
structure
in
subclinical
hypothyroidism
a
double
blind
placebo-controlled
study
Abstract
Text
Subclinical
hypothyroidism
(sHT)
affects
5-15%
of
the
general
population
however
the
need
of
lifelong
L-T(4)
therapy
is
still
controversial
As
myocardium
is
a
main
target
of
thyroid
hormone
action
we
investigated
whether
sHT
induces
cardiovascular
alterations
Twenty
sHT
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
placebo
or
L-T(4)
therapy
and
were
followed
for
1
yr
Twenty
sex-
and
age-matched
normal
subjects
served
as
controls
Doppler
echocardiography
and
videodensitometric
analysis
were
performed
in
all
subjects
Myocardium
textural
parameters
were
obtained
as
mean
gray
levels
which
were
then
used
to
calculate
the
cyclic
variation
index
(CVI
percent
systolic/diastolic
change
in
mean
gray
levels)
Patients
had
a
significantly
higher
isovolumic
relaxation
time
(31
+/-
05
vs
26
+/-
06
P
<
003)
peak
A
(077
+/-
016
vs
056
+/-
013
m/s
P
<
001)
and
preejection/ejection
time
(PEP/ET)
ratio
(072
+/-
005
vs
057
+/-
006
P
<
003)
and
a
lower
CVI
(P
<
00001)
than
controls
CVI
was
inversely
related
to
TSH
level
(P
<
00001)
and
PEP/ET
ratio
(P
<
001)
L-T(4)-treated
patients
showed
a
significant
reduction
of
the
PEP/ET
ratio
(P
<
005)
peak
A
(P
<
005)
and
isovolumic
relaxation
time
(P
<
005)
along
with
a
normalization
of
CVI
Conversely
no
changes
were
observed
in
the
placebo-treated
group
In
conclusion
sHT
affects
both
myocardial
structure
and
contractility
These
alterations
may
be
reversed
by
L-T(4)
therapy
