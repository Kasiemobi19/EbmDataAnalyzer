Asthma
associated
with
exercise
Abstract
Text
Exercise
is
a
potent
stimulus
to
asthma
The
diagnosis
is
not
always
straightforward
and
health
care
providers
should
have
a
high
index
of
suspicion
Treatment
usually
controls
exercise-induced
asthma
but
usually
requires
therapy
tailored
for
each
individual
patient
