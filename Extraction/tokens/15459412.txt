Diagnosis
of
genital
herpes
by
real
time
PCR
in
routine
clinical
practice
Abstract
Text
Virus
isolation
in
cell
culture
is
the
recognised
diagnostic
gold
standard
for
genital
herpes
Although
increasing
evidence
indicates
that
polymerase
chain
reaction
(PCR)
provides
a
more
rapid
and
sensitive
diagnostic
method
its
implementation
in
routine
diagnostic
settings
has
been
limited
by
concerns
over
contamination
and
cost
To
evaluate
the
feasibility
of
replacing
virus
culture
with
PCR
for
the
diagnosis
of
genital
herpes
in
settings
serving
large
populations
of
genitourinary
medicine
(GUM)
attendees
Genital
swabs
collected
from
233
consecutive
GUM
attendees
with
suspected
genital
herpes
were
tested
in
parallel
by
virus
culture
and
automated
real
time
PCR
Three
specimen
preparation
methods
were
evaluated
and
the
assay
reliability
was
assessed
by
repeat
testing
comparison
with
a
commercially
available
assay
and
herpes
simplex
virus
(HSV)
sequence
analysis
Probe
melting
temperatures
(Tm)
were
used
to
differentiate
between
HSV
types
without
additional
post-PCR
steps
HSV
was
detected
in
79/233
(34%)
samples
by
virus
culture
and
132/233
(57%)
samples
by
PCR
PCR
significantly
increased
HSV
detection
in
both
early
(<
5
days)
and
late
(>
or
=
5
days)
presentations
and
in
both
first
and
recurrent
episodes
HSV
detection
and
typing
by
PCR
was
achieved
within
less
than
4
hours
leading
to
a
significant
reduction
in
labour
compared
to
virus
culture
Most
specimens
(120/132
91%)
were
typed
as
HSV-2
Results
were
highly
reproducible
Real
time
PCR
is
a
highly
reproducible
rapid
and
labour
efficient
method
for
HSV
detection
in
genital
swabs
Its
implementation
is
feasible
in
routine
diagnostic
settings
