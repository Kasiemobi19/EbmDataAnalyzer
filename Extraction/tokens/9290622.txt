Celiac
disease
and
selective
immunoglobulin
A
deficiency
Abstract
Text
Selective
IgA
deficiency
was
observed
in
12
of
688
(17%)
patients
with
celiac
disease
who
were
clinically
undistinguishable
from
patients
with
celiac
disease
with
normal
IgA
levels
This
high
prevalence
of
IgA
deficiency
in
patients
with
celiac
disease
makes
serum
IgA
assay
advisable
when
screening
for
celiac
disease
is
performed
by
measurement
of
antigliadin
antibodies
or
anti-IgA
endomysium
antibodies
Similarly
subjects
with
IgA
deficiency
should
be
considered
at
risk
of
celiac
disease
