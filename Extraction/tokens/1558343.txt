Breast
cancer
screening
for
elderly

with

A
decision

model
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
breast
cancer
screening
extends
life
for
women
aged
65
years
or
more
with
and
without
comorbid
medical
conditions
A
provider-patient
encounter
A
decision
analysis
of
the
utility
of
screening
for
breast
cancer
Clinical
examination
and
mammography
among
four
groups
of
women
aged
65
to
85
or
more
years
average
health
mild
hypertension
congestive
heart
failure
and
average-health
black
women
The
effects
of
screening
were
estimated
using
the
best
quality
data
available
Screening
saved
life
at
all
ages
among
patients
studied
Savings
were
highest
for
black
women
and
decreased
with
increasing
age
and
comorbidity
Screening
all
average-health
women
aged
65
or
more
saved
67912
years
of
life
For
women
who
had
cancer
screening
extended
life
by
617
days
for
average-health
women
between
65
and
69
years
of
age
and
178
days
for
those
aged
85
years
or
more
Perioperative
mortality
and
test
characteristics
had
little
effect
on
the
results
The
risks
equaled
the
benefits
of
screening
only
when
operative
mortality
was
between
27%
and
62%
The
marginal
costs
of
screening
during
a
routine
office
visit
were
$138
and
increased
with
advancing
age
and
decreasing
test
specificity
Benefits
persisted
after
adjustment
for
changes
in
long-term
quality
of
life
however
for
women
aged
85
years
and
older
(with
and
without
comorbidities)
the
short-term
morbidity
of
anxiety
or
discomfort
associated
with
screening
may
have
outweighed
the
benefits
No
inherent
reason
exists
to
impose
an
upper-age
limit
for
breast
cancer
screening
however
more
data
are
needed
on
women's
preferences
for
screening
strategies
