The
risk
of
upper
gastrointestinal
complications
associated
with
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
glucocorticoids
acetaminophen
and
combinations
of
these
agents
Abstract
Text
Most
anti-inflammatory
drugs
have
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
serious
upper
gastrointestinal
complications
Epidemiological
studies
have
estimated
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
for
specific
anti-inflammatory
drugs
The
risk
of
upper
gastrointestinal
tract
bleeding
or
perforation
increases
around
twofold
with
use
of
oral
steroids
or
low
dose
aspirin
and
increases
around
fourfold
with
use
of
nonaspirin
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
Acetaminophen
at
daily
doses
of
2000
mg
and
higher
has
also
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk
Overall
the
risk
is
dose
dependent
and
is
greater
with
more
than
one
anti-inflammatory
drug
taken
simultaneously
Hence
whenever
possible
anti-inflammatory
drugs
should
be
given
in
monotherapy
and
at
the
lowest
effective
dose
in
order
to
reduce
the
risk
of
serious
upper
gastrointestinal
complications
