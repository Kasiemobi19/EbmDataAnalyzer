Abstract
Text
Screening
mammography
is
effective
in
reducing
breast
cancer
mortality
in
women
between
the
ages
of
50
and
69
years
We
sought
to
determine
whether
older
women
who
undergo
screening
mammography
have
a
decreased
risk
of
metastatic
breast
cancer
We
studied
690993
women
aged
66
to
79
years
who
were
California
Medicare
beneficiaries
from
January
1992
to
December
1993
and
who
chose
the
fee-for-service
plan
Health

B
billing
records
were
used
to
determine
the
use
of
screening
mammography
The
extent
of
breast
cancer
(in
situ
local
regional
or
metastatic)
was
ascertained
for
the
6767
women
who
were
diagnosed
with
the
disease
in
1993
using
data
from
the
California
State
Cancer
Registry
For
each
type
(extent)
of
breast
cancer
the
relative
risk
(RR)
and
95%
confidence
(CI)
of
developing
breast
cancer
was
estimated
by
dividing
the
risk
of
its
development
in
screened
women
by
the
risk
in
women
who
were
not
screened
A
total
of
46%
of
women
had
mammography
during
the
2-year
study
period
In
situ
local
and
regional
breast
cancer
were
more
likely
to
be
detected
among
women
who
underwent
screening
mammography
For
example
the
relative
risk
of
detecting
local
breast
cancer
in
screened
women
was
33
(95%
CI
31
to
35)
The
risk
of
detecting
metastatic
breast
cancer
on
the
other
hand
was
significantly
reduced
among
women
aged
66
to
79
years
who
underwent
screening
mammography
(RR
=
057
95%
CI
045
to
072)
Screening
mammography
is
associated
with
a
decreased
risk
of
detecting
metastatic
breast
cancer
among
elderly
women
Public
health
recommendations
need
to
weigh
the
benefit
of
screening
elderly
women
against
the
cost
and
potential
harm
from
screening
and
treating
early
lesions
that
may
have
no
effect
on
mortality
