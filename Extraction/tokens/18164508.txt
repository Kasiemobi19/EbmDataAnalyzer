Early
switch
to
pentoxifylline
in
patients
with
severe
alcoholic
hepatitis
is
inefficient
in
non-responders
to
corticosteroids
Abstract
Text
In
severe
alcoholic
hepatitis
(AH)
40%
of
patients
will
obtain
no
benefit
from
corticosteroids
Improvement
in
management
of
non-responders
is
warranted
and
only
pentoxifylline
can
be
considered
an
alternative
A
two-step
strategy
was
evaluated
consisting
of
early
withdrawal
of
corticosteroids
and
a
switch
to
pentoxifylline
for
28
additional
days
in
non-responders
identified
using
early
change
in
bilirubin
level
One
hundred
and
twenty-one
patients
with
AH
were
treated
prospectively
with
corticosteroids
and
the
two-step
strategy
was
proposed
to
29
non-responders
treated
according
to
a
two-step
strategy
who
were
compared
to
58
matched
non-responders
treated
with
corticosteroids
only
Clinical
and
biological
features
of
the
two
groups
were
similar
There
was
no
survival
improvement
at
2
months
in
patients
treated
with
the
two-step
strategy
compared
to
controls
355+/-63%
vs
31+/-86%
After
21
days
biological
evolution
was
similar
for
prothrombin
time
(-025s
vs
+02s)
bilirubin
(08
mg/dl
vs
203
mg/dl)
and
creatinine
(+016
mg/dl
vs
-07
mg/dl)
In
multivariate
analysis
only
age
evolution
of
bilirubin
during
the
first
week
creatinine
and
DF
were
associated
with
2-month
survival
Non-responders
to
corticosteroids
do
not
obtain
any
benefit
from
an
early
switch
to
pentoxifylline
Thus
the
issue
of
management
of
non-responders
remains
unresolved
