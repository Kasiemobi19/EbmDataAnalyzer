Evaluation
of
febrile
infants
under
3

of
age
is
routine
lumbar
puncture
warranted
Abstract
Text
Fever
may
be
the
sole
clinically
evident
presentation
of
serious
bacterial
infection
(SBI)
in
a
very
young
infant
and
therefore
lumbar
puncture
is
still
widely
regarded
as
a
mandatory
procedure
in
the
sepsis
workup
of
febrile
infants
under
2
months
of
age
In
this
retrospective
study
we
evaluated
the
frequency
and
the
diagnostic
value
of
cerebrospinal
fluid
examination
in
492
infants
aged
less
than
3
months
who
were
hospitalized
because
of
fever
during
1988-1994
The
patients
were
categorized
as
being
at
"high
risk"
or
"low
risk"
for
SBI
according
to
current
clinical
and
laboratory
criteria
Among
the
492
infants
196
(40%)
were
identified
as
"high-risk"
for
SBI
and
296
(60%)
were
at
low
risk
Among
the
overall
series
of
infants
60
babies
(12%)
were
subsequently
proven
with
bacterial
infection
Among
the
196
"high-risk"
babies
26%
had
bacterial
infection
compared
to
only
3%
of
the
296
infants
at
low
risk
(p
<
00001)
denoting
a
sensitivity
of
85%
and
a
specificity
of
65%
of
the
clinical
classification
criteria
Lumbar
puncture
was
done
to
186
(46%)
infants
upon
hospital
admission
176
punctures
yielded
satisfactory
samples
of
cerebrospinal
fluid
(CSF)
Sixteen
(3%)
patients
had
abnormal
CSF
findings
2
of
them
had
positive
bacterial
cultures
and
14
were
compatible
with
aseptic
meningitis
The
2
patients
with
purulent
meningitis
were
clinically
very
ill
and
were
immediately
recognized
as
deserving
a
lumbar
puncture
Of
the
14
patients
with
aseptic
meningitis
13
were
initially
screened
as
being
at
high
risk
for
serious
infection
and
therefore
underwent
a
lumbar
puncture
Over
the
years
of
this
survey
a
declining
trend
for
performing
lumbar
puncture
in
"low-risk"
young
febrile
infants
became
evident
during
1988-1992
evaluation
of
sepsis
included
a
lumbar
puncture
in
45%
of
the
infants
compared
to
27%
during
the
following
2
years
(p
<
00001)
Not
one
instance
of
purulent
meningitis
evolved
among
the
infants
in
whom
lumbar
puncture
was
not
performed
Our
observations
suggest
that
hospitalized
young
febrile
infants
may
safely
be
spared
a
lumbar
puncture
when
they
do
not
meet
the
proposed
criteria
for
being
at
high
risk
or
when
their
clinical
and
laboratory
picture
suggests
being
at
low
risk
for
SBI
