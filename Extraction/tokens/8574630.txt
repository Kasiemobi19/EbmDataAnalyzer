Prevalence
and
biological
consequences
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
in
elderly
institutionalized
subjects
Abstract
Text
The
prevalence
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
was
evaluated
in
a
population
of
elderly
institutionalized
subjects
in
seven
long-term
geriatric
care
facilities
in
France
(Amiens
Francheville
Ivry
Lille
Montpellier
Oissel
and
Villejuif)
Residents
whose
functional
capability
was
relatively
good
were
entered
into
the
study
There
were
126
patients
(99
females
and
27
males)
with
a
mean
age
+/-
SD
of
84
+/-
66
years
All
subjects
had
been
institutionalized
for
over
six
months
and
were
capable
of
walking
at
least
as
far
as
the
dining
room
None
had
received
vitamin
D
or
other
compounds
known
to
affect
the
metabolism
of
phosphorus
and
calcium
within
six
months
before
the
study
Vitamin
D
status
was
evaluated
by
determining
serum
25
hydroxyvitamin
D
(25
OH
D)
levels
using
a
radiocompetition
assay
after
extraction
and
chromatographic
separation
Mean
serum
25
OH
D
was
317
+/-
252
ng/ml
(median
25)
Eighty-five
per
cent
of
subjects
had
serum
25
OH
D
values
of
less
than
5
ng/ml
and
98%
had
values
under
10
ng/ml
which
is
the
cutoff
usually
taken
to
define
vitamin
D
deficiency
Mean
serum
levels
of
intact
parathyroid
hormone
were
increased
approximately
two-fold
as
compared
with
values
in
healthy
adults
(70
+/-
39
pg/ml
versus
33
+/-
12
pg/ml)
Biochemical
markers
for
bone
formation
(alkaline
phosphatase
osteocalcin)
and
bone
resorption
(TRAP
hydroxyproline
pyridinoline)
were
all
increased
with
mean
values
14-fold
to
34-fold
those
seen
in
healthy
adults
Serum
25
OH
D
levels
were
negatively
correlated
with
serum
intact
parathyroid
hormone
levels
(r
=
041
p
<
00001)
Serum
intact
parathyroid
hormone
levels
were
positively
correlated
with
alkaline
phosphatase
activity
(r
=
030
p
<
0001)
and
serum
osteocalcin
levels
(r
=
036
p
<
00001)
and
negatively
correlated
with
corrected
serum
calcium
levels
(r
=
-020
p
<
002)
Conclusion
Our
data
demonstrate
that
severe
vitamin
D
deficiency
is
present
in
virtually
all
elderly
institutionalized
subjects
and
is
accompanied
with
secondary
hyperparathyroidism
responsible
for
increases
in
markers
of
bone
remodeling
Routine
vitamin
D
supplementation
is
warranted
in
elderly
institutionalized
subjects
