Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
Seasonale
91-day
extended
cycle
oral
contraceptive
(OC)
A
parallel
randomized
multicenter
open-label
1-year
study
of
the
OC
Seasonale
[30
microg
ethinyl
estradiol
(EE)/150
microg
levonorgestrel
(LNG)
and
Nordette-28
(30
microg
EE/150
microg
LNG)]
in
sexually
active
adult
women
(18-40
years)
of
childbearing
potential
Patients
received
either
four
91-day
cycles
of
extended
cycle
regimen
OC
or
13
cycles
of
the
conventional
28-day
OC
with
daily
monitoring
of
compliance
and
bleeding
via
electronic
diaries
When
taken
daily
for
84
days
followed
by
7
days
of
placebo
the
extended
cycle
regimen
was
effective
in
preventing
pregnancy
and
had
a
safety
profile
that
was
comparable
to
that
observed
with
the
28-day
OC
regimen
that
served
as
the
control
While
unscheduled
(breakthrough)
bleeding
was
reported
among
patients
treated
with
the
extended
cycle
regimen
it
decreased
with
each
successive
cycle
of
therapy
and
was
comparable
to
that
reported
by
patients
who
received
the
conventional
OC
regimen
by
the
fourth
extended
cycle
This
study
demonstrated
that
Seasonale
91-day
extended
cycle
OC
containing
84
days
of
30
microg
EE/150
microg
LNG
followed
by
7
days
of
placebo
was
effective
safe
and
well
tolerated
