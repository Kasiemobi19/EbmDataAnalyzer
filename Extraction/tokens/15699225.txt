Direct
comparison
of
a
dietary
portfolio
of
cholesterol-lowering
foods
with
a
statin
in
hypercholesterolemic
participants
Abstract
Text
3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
A
(HMG-CoA)
reductase
inhibitors
reduce
serum
cholesterol
and
are
increasingly
advocated
in
primary
prevention
to
achieve
reductions
in
LDL
cholesterol
Newer
dietary
approaches
combining
cholesterol-lowering
foods
may
offer
another
option
but
these
approaches
have
not
been
compared
directly
with
statins
in
the
same
persons
The
objective
was
to
compare
in
the
same
subjects
the
cholesterol-lowering
potential
of
a
dietary
portfolio
with
that
of
a
statin
Thirty-four
hyperlipidemic
participants
underwent
all
three
1-mo
treatments
in
random
order
as
outpatients
a
very-low-saturated-fat
diet
(control
diet)
the
same
diet
plus
20
mg
lovastatin
(statin
diet)
and
a
diet
high
in
plant
sterols
(10
g/1000
kcal)
soy-protein
foods
(including
soy
milks
and
soy
burgers
214
g/1000
kcal)
almonds
(14
g/1000
kcal)
and
viscous
fibers
from
oats
barley
psyllium
and
the
vegetables
okra
and
eggplant
(10
g/1000
kcal)
(portfolio
diets)
Fasting
blood
samples
were
obtained
at
0
2
and
4
wk
LDL-cholesterol
concentrations
decreased
by
85+/-19%
333+/-19%
and
296+/-13%
after
4
wk
of
the
control
statin
and
portfolio
diets
respectively
Although
the
absolute
difference
between
the
statin
and
the
portfolio
treatments
was
significant
at
4
wk
(P=0013)
9
participants
(26%)
achieved
their
lowest
LDL-cholesterol
concentrations
with
the
portfolio
diet
Moreover
the
statin
(n=27)
and
the
portfolio
(n=24)
diets
did
not
differ
significantly
(P=0288)
in
their
ability
to
reduce
LDL
cholesterol
below
the
34-mmol/L
primary
prevention
cutoff
Dietary
combinations
may
not
differ
in
potency
from
first-generation
statins
in
achieving
current
lipid
goals
for
primary
prevention
They
may
therefore
bridge
the
treatment
gap
between
current
therapeutic
diets
and
newer
statins
