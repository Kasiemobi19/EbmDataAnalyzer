Albuminuria
and
risk
of
cardiovascular
events
death
and
heart
failure
in
diabetic
and
nondiabetic
individuals
Abstract
Text
Microalbuminuria
is
a
risk
factor
for
cardiovascular
(CV)
events
The
relationship
between
the
degree
of
albuminuria
and
CV
risk
is
unclear
To
estimate
the
risk
of
CV
events
in
high-risk
individuals
with
diabetes
mellitus
(DM)
and
without
DM
who
have
microalbuminuria
and
to
determine
whether
levels
of
albuminuria
below
the
microalbuminuria
threshold
increase
CV
risk
The
Heart
Outcomes
Prevention
Evaluation
study
a
cohort
study
conducted
between
1994
and
1999
with
a
median
45
years
of
follow-up
Community
and
academic
practices
in
North
and
South
America
and
Europe
Individuals
aged
55
years
or
more
with
a
history
of
CV
disease
(n
=
5545)
or
DM
and
at
least
1
CV
risk
factor
(n
=
3498)
and
a
baseline
urine
albumin/creatinine
ratio
(ACR)
measurement
Cardiovascular
events
(myocardial
infarction
stroke
or
CV
death)
all-cause
death
and
hospitalization
for
congestive
heart
failure
Microalbuminuria
was
detected
in
1140
(326%)
of
those
with
DM
and
823
(148%)
of
those
without
DM
at
baseline
Microalbuminuria
increased
the
adjusted
relative
risk
(RR)
of
major
CV
events
(RR
183
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
164-205)
all-cause
death
(RR
209
95%
CI
184-238)
and
hospitalization
for
congestive
heart
failure
(RR
323
95%
CI
254-410)
Similar
RRs
were
seen
for
participants
with
or
without
DM
even
after
adjusting
for
other
CV
risk
factors
(eg
the
adjusted
RR
of
the
primary
aggregate
end
point
was
197
[95%
CI
168-231]
in
those
with
DM
and
161
[95%
CI
136-190]
in
those
without
DM)
Compared
with
the
lowest
quartile
of
ACR
(<022
mg/mmol)
the
RRs
of
the
primary
aggregate
end
point
in
the
second
quartile
(ie
ACR
range
022-057
mg/mmol)
was
111
(95%
CI
095-130)
third
quartile
138
(95%
CI
119-160
ACR
range
058-162
mg/mmol)
and
fourth
quartile
197
(95%
CI
173-225
ACR
range
>162
mg/mmol)
(P
for
trend
<001
even
after
excluding
those
with
microalbuminuria)
For
every
04-mg/mmol
increase
in
ACR
level
the
adjusted
hazard
of
major
CV
events
increased
by
59%
(95%
CI
49%-70%)
Our
results
indicate
that
any
degree
of
albuminuria
is
a
risk
factor
for
CV
events
in
individuals
with
or
without
DM
the
risk
increases
with
the
ACR
starting
well
below
the
microalbuminuria
cutoff
Screening
for
albuminuria
identifies
people
at
high
risk
for
CV
events
