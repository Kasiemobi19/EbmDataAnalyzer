Immune
response
to
meningococcal
serogroup
C
conjugate
vaccine
in
asplenic
individuals
Abstract
Text
Asplenic
individuals
are
known
to
be
at
increased
risk
of
infection
with
encapsulated
bacteria
Recent
United
Kingdom
recommendations
stated
that
this
at-risk
group
should
receive
one
dose
of
the
meningococcal
serogroup
C
conjugate
(MCC)
vaccine
However
the
immune
response
of
asplenic
individuals
to
MCC
vaccine
is
unknown
The
immune
response
of
asplenics
(n
=
130)
to
immunization
with
the
MCC
vaccine
was
investigated
Asplenic
individuals
had
a
significantly
lower
geometric
mean
titer
(GMT)
(1578
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
945
to
2633)
of
bactericidal
antibody
in
serum
(SBA)
than
an
age-matched
control
group
(n
=
48)
(14482
95%
CI
7511
to
27920)
However
80%
of
asplenic
individuals
achieved
the
proposed
protective
SBA
titer
of
>
or
=8
No
differences
were
observed
between
the
two
groups
in
the
serogroup
C-specific
immunoglobulin
G
geometric
mean
concentration
A
significant
reduction
in
SBA
GMT
or
the
number
of
responders
achieving
an
SBA
titer
of
>
or
=8
was
observed
if
the
reason
for
splenectomy
was
a
medical
cause
or
if
MCC
vaccination
occurred
<10
years
after
splenectomy
Individuals
(n
=
29)
who
did
not
achieve
an
SBA
titer
of
>
or
=16
were
offered
a
second
dose
of
MCC
vaccine
Analysis
of
the
SBA
response
revealed
that
61%
(14
of
23)
of
the
individuals
who
received
a
second
dose
achieved
a
protective
titer
In
total
93%
of
asplenic
individuals
achieved
a
titer
of
>
or
=8
following
MCC
vaccination
(one
or
two
doses
combined)
We
recommend
that
following
vaccination
of
asplenics
either
the
level
of
functional
antibody
should
be
determined
with
a
second
dose
of
MCC
vaccine
offered
to
nonresponders
or
two
doses
of
MCC
vaccine
should
be
routinely
offered
