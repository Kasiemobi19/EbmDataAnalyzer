Prevalence
of
Neisseria
Gonorrhoeae
among
men
screened
for
Chlamydia
Trachomatis
in
four
United

cities
1999-2003
Abstract
Text
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
infections
are
the
second
most
commonly
reported
disease
in
the
United
States
and
cause
significant
morbidity
We
describe
the
prevalence
of
gonorrhea
in
a
large
sample
of
men
tested
for
gonorrhea
and
Chlamydia
trachomatis
in
Baltimore
Denver
San
Francisco
and
Seattle
Gonorrhea
prevalence
was
measured
among
17712
men
tested
in
a
variety
of
non-sexually
transmitted
disease
(STD)
clinic
venues
using
urine-based
nucleic
acid
amplification
tests
Among
16850
asymptomatic
men
prevalence
ranged
from
0%
to
15%
by
city
(P=020)
Baltimore
13%
Denver
15%
San
Francisco
15%
and
Seattle
0%
Among
862
symptomatic
men
the
gonorrhea
prevalence
varied
from
00%
to
283%
by
city
(P<001)
The
high
prevalence
of
gonorrhea
in
symptomatic
men
supports
the
importance
of
testing
for
symptomatic
men
The
prevalence
of
gonorrhea
among
asymptomatic
men
is
low
and
routine
screening
cannot
be
recommended
when
screening
is
performed
for
chlamydia
unless
a
substantial
local
prevalence
of
gonorrhea
can
be
documented
in
specific
targeted
venues
or
population
groups
