Prospective
comparison
of
three
predictive
rules
for
assessing
severity
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
in
Hong

Abstract
Text
Community-acquired
pneumonia
(CAP)
is
a
leading
infectious
cause
of
death
throughout
the
world
including
Hong
Kong
To
compare
the
ability
of
three
validated
prediction
rules
for
CAP
to
predict
mortality
in
Hong
Kong
the
20
variable
Pneumonia
Severity
Index
(PSI)
the
6-point
CURB65
scale
adopted
by
the
British
Thoracic
Society
and
the
simpler
CRB65
A
prospective
observational
study
of
1016
consecutive
inpatients
with
CAP
(583
men
mean
(SD)
age
72
(17)
years)
was
performed
in
a
university
hospital
in
the
New
Territories
of
Hong
Kong
in
2004
The
patients
were
classified
into
three
risk
groups
(low
intermediate
and
high)
according
to
each
rule
The
ability
of
the
three
rules
to
predict
30
day
mortality
was
compared
The
overall
mortality
and
intensive
care
unit
(ICU)
admission
rates
were
86%
and
40%
respectively
PSI
CURB65
and
CRB65
performed
similarly
and
the
areas
under
the
receiver
operating
characteristic
(ROC)
curve
were
0736
(95%
CI
0687
to
0736)
0733
(95%
CI
0679
to
0787)
and
0694
(95%
CI
0634
to
0753)
respectively
All
three
rules
had
high
negative
predictive
values
but
relatively
low
positive
predictive
values
at
all
cut-off
points
Larger
proportions
of
patients
were
identified
as
low
risk
by
PSI
(472%)
and
CURB65
(433%)
than
by
CRB65
(126%)
All
three
predictive
rules
have
a
similar
performance
in
predicting
the
severity
of
CAP
but
CURB65
is
more
suitable
than
the
other
two
for
use
in
the
emergency
department
because
of
its
simplicity
of
application
and
ability
to
identify
low-risk
patients
