non-selective
beta-
and
alpha-adrenergic
blockade
in
patients
with
coexistent
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
and
chronic
heart
failure
Abstract
Text
Patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
(CHF)
have
a
resting
restrictive
ventilatory
defect
Any
type
of
exercise
requires
patients
with
CHF
to
markedly
increase
their
minute
ventilation
Patients
with
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD)
have
airflow
obstruction
that
leads
to
dynamic
lung
hyperinflation
and
reduced
ventilatory
response
to
exercise
Because
exercise
is
associated
with
abnormally
high
minute
ventilation
in
patients
with
CHF
and
with
a
limited
minute
ventilation
increase
in
patients
with
COPD
functional
capacity
is
severely
impaired
in
patients
with
coexistent
CHF
and
COPD
Optimal
treatment
of
both
conditions
is
a
prerequisite
to
maximally
improve
functional
capacity
in
patients
with
CHF
and
COPD
Unfortunately
beta-adrenergic
blockade
the
current
cornerstone
of
CHF
therapy
is
frequently
omitted
in
patients
with
CHF
and
COPD
for
fear
of
inducing
bronchoconstriction
Furthermore
when
prescribed
beta-adrenergic
blockade
is
often
attempted
with
a
moderate
dose
of
metoprolol
tartrate
a
beta-1-blocker
that
results
in
lesser
clinical
benefits
than
combined
non-selective
beta-blockade
with
carvedilol
at
the
maximally
recommended
dose
Recent
experience
indicates
that
combined
non-selective
beta-
and
alpha-blockade
with
carvedilol
is
well
tolerated
in
patients
with
COPD
who
do
not
have
reversible
airway
obstruction
Alpha-adrenergic
blockade
may
promote
mild
bronchodilation
that
offsets
non-selective
beta
blockade-induced
bronchoconstriction
in
patients
with
obstructive
airway
disease
