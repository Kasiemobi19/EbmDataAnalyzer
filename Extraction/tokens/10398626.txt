Abstract
Text
To
identify
and
synthesise
the
evidence
for
efficacy
and
cost
effectiveness
of
topical
treatments
for
superficial
fungal
infections
of
the
skin
and
nails
of
the
feet
Systematic
review
Topical
treatments
for
superficial
fungal
infections
Cure
confirmed
by
culture
and
microscopy
for
skin
and
by
culture
for
nails
in
patients
with
clinically
diagnosed
fungal
infections
Of
126
trials
identified
in
121
papers
72
(571%)
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Placebo
controlled
trials
yielded
pooled
relative
risks
of
failure
to
cure
skin
infections
allylamines
(030
95%
confidence
interval
024
to
038)
azoles
(054
042
to
068)
undecenoic
acid
(028
0
11
to
074)
and
tolnaftate
(046
017
to
122)
Although
meta-analysis
of
11
trials
comparing
allylamines
and
azoles
showed
a
relative
risk
of
failure
to
cure
of
088
(078
to
099)
in
favour
of
allylamines
there
was
evidence
of
language
bias
Seven
reports
in
English
favoured
allylamines
(079
069
to
091)
but
four
reports
in
foreign
languages
showed
no
difference
between
the
two
drugs
(1
01
090
to
113)
Neither
trial
of
nail
infections
showed
significant
differences
between
alternative
topical
treatments
Allylamines
azoles
and
undecenoic
acid
were
efficacious
in
placebo
controlled
trials
There
are
sufficient
comparative
trials
to
judge
relative
efficacy
only
between
allylamines
and
azoles
Allylamines
cure
slightly
more
infections
than
azoles
but
are
much
more
expensive
than
azoles
The
most
cost
effective
strategy
is
first
to
treat
with
azoles
or
undecenoic
acid
and
to
use
allylamines
only
if
that
fails
