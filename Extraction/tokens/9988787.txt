Cold-knife
conization
versus
conization
by
the
loop
electrosurgical

procedure
a
randomized
prospective
study
Abstract
Text
Our
purpose
was
to
compare
the
diagnostic
ability
and
treatment
efficacy
of
conization
by
the
loop
electrosurgical
excision
procedure
with
cold-knife
conization
One
hundred
eighty
women
who
required
conization
for
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
cervical
dysplasia
or
microinvasive
cervical
carcinoma
were
prospectively
enrolled
in
a
randomized
clinical
trial
to
receive
either
cold-knife
conization
or
conization
by
the
loop
electrosurgical
excision
procedure
Conization
complications
rate
of
lesion
clearance
and
therapeutic
outcome
were
assessed
for
the
2
study
groups
There
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
in
the
complication
rate
(P
=
100)
the
rate
of
lesion
clearance
(P
=18)
or
the
rate
of
disease
recurrence
(P
=13)
between
the
2
study
groups
The
mean
follow-up
was
112
months
in
the
cold-knife
conization
group
and
104
months
in
the
loop-excision
conization
group
Cold-knife
conization
and
loop-excision
conization
yield
similar
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
results
