Beneficial
effects
of
weight
loss
in
overweight
patients
with
chronic
proteinuric
nephropathies
Abstract
Text
Proteinuria
is
a
recognized
complication
of
obesity
but
no
study
has
investigated
the
effect
of
weight
loss
in
overweight
patients
with
chronic
proteinuric
nephropathies
of
different
causes
We
randomly
assigned
(in
a
21
ratio)
30
overweight
patients
(body
mass
index
[BMI]
>
27
kg/m(2))
with
diabetic
and
nondiabetic
proteinuric
nephropathies
to
either
follow
a
low-calorie
normoproteinic
diet
or
maintain
their
usual
dietary
intake
for
5
months
The
primary
outcome
was
change
in
urinary
protein
excretion
Secondary
outcomes
were
changes
in
renal
function
(serum
creatinine
level
and
Cockcroft-Gault
creatinine
clearance)
and
lipid
profile
Patients
in
the
diet
group
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
body
weight
and
BMI
whereas
patients
in
the
control
group
showed
a
significant
increase
in
body
weight
and
BMI
(between-group
comparison
P
<
005)
Mean
weight
loss
in
the
diet
group
was
41%
+/-
3%
and
14
of
20
patients
in
this
group
lost
more
than
3%
Proteinuria
decreased
by
312%
+/-
37%
in
the
diet
group
(from
protein
of
28
+/-
14
to
19
+/-
14
g/24
h
P
<
0005)
whereas
it
tended
to
increase
in
the
control
group
(between-group
comparison
P
<
005)
Changes
in
renal
function
did
not
differ
significantly
between
groups
although
renal
function
remained
stable
in
the
diet
group
and
showed
significant
worsening
in
the
control
group
Serum
triglyceride
levels
remained
stable
in
the
diet
group
and
tended
to
increase
in
the
control
group
(between-group
comparison
P
<
005)
Moderate
weight
loss
in
overweight
patients
with
chronic
proteinuric
nephropathies
induces
a
significant
decrease
in
proteinuria
