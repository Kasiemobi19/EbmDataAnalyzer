How
transient
are
transient
ischemic
attacks
Abstract
Text
Information
on
1343
hospitalized
patients
in
the
Cornell
Neurology
Database
with
final
diagnoses
of
transient
ischemic
attacks
(TIA)
reversible
ischemic
neurologic
deficits
(RIND)
or
ischemic
stroke
was
examined
in
order
to
determine
the
duration
of
ischemic
deficits
Episodes
resolved
within
the
first
24
hours
(classic
definition
of
TIA)
in
382
of
the
patients
(284%)
and
between
days
1
and
7
(consistent
with
RIND)
in
34
(25%)
In
191
of
the
382
patients
with
traditionally-defined
TIAs
(500%)
episodes
lasted
less
than
30
minutes
and
in
another
37
(97%)
from
30
to
60
minutes
Of
1115
patients
with
deficits
lasting
at
least
60
minutes
only
154
(138%)
resolved
within
24
hours
and
could
thus
be
considered
to
have
had
a
TIA
Resolution
within
the
next
hour
occurred
in
only
39
of
1152
patients
(34%)
with
a
deficit
at
30
minutes
21
of
1115
patients
(19%)
with
a
deficit
at
60
minutes
19
of
1113
patients
(17%)
with
a
deficit
at
90
minutes
and
16
of
1094
patients
(15%)
with
a
deficit
at
120
minutes
The
data
suggest
that
as
currently
managed
patients
with
a
deficit
persisting
at
least
60
minutes
have
less
than
a
2%
chance
of
resolving
spontaneously
during
any
subsequent
1-hour
period
Rapid
resolution
after
instituting
a
new
treatment
in
relatively
few
additional
patients
would
suggest
a
therapeutic
effect
even
in
a
nonrandomized
trial
