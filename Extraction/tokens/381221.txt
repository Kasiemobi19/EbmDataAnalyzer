Effects
of
tolmetin
paracetamol
and
of
two
combinations
of
tolmetin
and
paracetamol
as
compared
to
placebo
on
experimentally
induced
pain
A
double
blind
study
Abstract
Text
Previous
studies
in
animals
suggested
that
a
coadministration
of
the
anti-rheumatic/anti-inflammatory
agent
tolmetin
(Tolectin)
and
of
paracetamol
potentiates
the
effects
of
these
two
drugs
The
present
study
was
carried
out
to
assess
whether
or
not
the
dosis
of
tolmetin
necessary
to
obtain
an
analgesic
effect
can
be
reduced
when
paracetamol
is
coadministered
in
a
model
with
experimentally
induced
pain
in
healthy
human
subjects
The
effects
of
tolmetin
200
mg
(T
200)
paracetamol
400
mg
(P
400)
tolmetin
150
mg
plus
paracetamol
300
mg
(T
150
+
P
300)
and
of
tolmetin
100
mg
plus
paracetamol
400
mg
(T
100
+
P
400)
on
pain
threshold
to
electrical
and
thermal
stimuli
and
on
pain
tolerance
to
electrical
stimuli
were
compared
to
the
effects
of
placebo
under
double
blind
conditions
Each
of
20
healthy
volunteers
received
all
of
the
5
treatments
randomised
according
to
four
5
X
5
Latin
squares
The
results
showed
that
the
combination
T
100
+
P
400
had
better
analgesic
effects
than
the
double
dose
of
tolmetin
T
200
alone
while
the
effects
of
P
400
could
not
be
discrminated
from
placebo
In
a
sequential
t-test
the
effects
of
T
100
+
P
400
could
be
discriminated
from
placebo
already
after
14
Ss
The
effects
of
T
200
T
150
+
P
300
and
T
100
+
P
400
respectively
could
not
be
differentiated
indicating
that
the
dose
of
tolmetin
can
be
reduced
markedly
by
simultaneous
administration
of
paracetamol
without
a
loss
in
analgesic
potency
Coadministration
of
tolmetin
and
paracetamol
permits
a
marked
reduction
of
the
dose
of
tolmetin
without
any
loss
of
analgesic
potency
as
measured
in
a
model
with
experimentally
induced
pain
in
healthy
subjects
