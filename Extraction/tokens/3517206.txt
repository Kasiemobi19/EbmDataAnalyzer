Hepatosplenomegaly
in
infectious
mononucleosis
assessed
by
ultrasonic
scanning
Abstract
Text
The
present
study
aims
at
an
assessment
of
hepato-splenomegaly
in
infectious
mononucleosis
(IM)
In
29
patients
admitted
to
the
ENT
department
with
IM
based
on
the
typical
clinical
and
laboratory
findings
including
a
positive
mononucleosis
test
in
most
cases
the
size
of
the
liver
and
spleen
was
estimated
by
ultrasonic
scanning
on
days
1
3
5
10
20
30
90
and
120
after
admission
A
control
group
of
eight
patients
with
peritonsillar
abscess
was
included
for
comparison
The
results
showed
that
all
patients
had
an
enlarged
spleen
(mean
enlargement
50-60
per
cent)
but
only
a
few
were
palpable
Half
of
the
patients
had
enlargement
of
the
liver
(5-20
per
cent)
which
was
palpable
in
only
8
per
cent
There
was
no
correlation
between
the
size
of
the
spleen
and
that
of
the
liver
not
between
the
changes
in
the
size
of
these
organs
There
was
no
enlargement
of
the
liver
or
spleen
in
the
control
group
No
correlation
was
found
between
the
size
or
changes
in
the
size
of
the
organs
and
blood
values
such
as
lactatdehydrogenase
and
aspartatamino-transferase
There
is
however
a
striking
parallelism
between
the
curves
for
these
parameters
which
might
indicate
that
the
organs
as
well
as
the
blood
tests
return
to
normal
within
28
days
If
this
holds
true
our
warning
to
abstain
from
physical
exercise
and
alcoholic
intake
may
be
limited
to
a
period
of
about
1
month
