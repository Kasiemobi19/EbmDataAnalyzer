Comparative
clinical
trial
of
mebendazole
and
metronidazole
in
giardiasis
of
children
Abstract
Text
Giardiasis
and
soil-transmitted
helminthosis
are
prevalent
in
many
parts
of
the
world
Application
of
a
single
drug
for
treatment
of
both
giardiasis
and
soil-transmitted
helminthosis
is
highly
desirable
One
hundred
children
of
both
sexes
ranging
from
7
to
12
years
old
with
Giardia
intestinalis
cysts
or
trophozoites
in
their
stool
samples
were
randomly
separated
into
two
groups
of
50
individuals
each
Each
group
received
either
mebendazole
tablets
200
mg
thrice
daily
for
5
days
or
metronidazole
tablet
15
mg/kg/day
in
three
divided
doses
for
7
days
The
results
were
evaluated
by
microscopic
examination
of
stools
on
two
successive
occasions
1
week
and
2
weeks
after
treatment
Each
occasion
consisted
of
three
stool
examination
on
3
successive
days
The
cure
rate
of
mebendazole-treated
children
was
43
out
of
50
(86
per
cent)
and
for
metronidazole
it
was
45
out
of
50
(90
per
cent)
with
no
statistical
difference
between
the
two
groups
No
side-effects
were
observed
in
the
mebendazole-treated
group
whereas
nausea
anorexia
and
metallic
taste
were
observed
in
49
6
and
24
per
cent
of
metronidazole-treated
children
respectively
In
conclusion
the
use
of
mebendazole
which
is
less
toxic
with
no
side-effects
is
available
and
effective
on
Giardia
intestinalis
as
well
as
intestinal
nematodes
is
recommended
especially
in
the
areas
where
giardiasis
and
intestinal
nematodiasis
are
prevalent
and
overlap
