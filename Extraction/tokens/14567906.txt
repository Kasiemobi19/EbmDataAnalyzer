The
effectiveness
of
diagnostic
tests
for
the
assessment
of
shoulder
pain
due
to
soft
tissue
disorders
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
evidence
for
the
effectiveness
and
cost-effectiveness
of
the
newer
diagnostic
imaging
tests
as
an
addition
to
clinical
examination
and
patient
history
for
the
diagnosis
of
soft
tissue
shoulder
disorders
Literature
was
identified
from
several
sources
including
general
medical
databases
Studies
were
identified
that
evaluated
clinical
examination
ultrasound
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI)
or
magnetic
resonance
arthrography
(MRA)
in
patients
suspected
of
having
soft
tissue
shoulder
disorders
Outcomes
assessed
were
clinical
impingement
syndrome
or
rotator
cuff
tear
(full
partial
or
any)
Only
cohort
studies
were
included
The
methodological
quality
of
included
test
accuracy
studies
was
assessed
using
a
formal
quality
assessment
tool
for
diagnostic
studies
and
the
extraction
of
study
findings
was
conducted
in
duplicate
using
a
pre-designed
and
piloted
data
extraction
form
to
avoid
any
errors
For
each
test
sensitivity
specificity
and
positive
and
negative
likelihood
ratios
with
95%
confidence
intervals
were
calculated
for
each
study
Where
possible
pooled
estimates
of
sensitivity
specificity
and
likelihood
ratios
were
calculated
using
random
effects
methods
Potential
sources
of
heterogeneity
were
investigated
by
conducting
subgroup
analyses
In
the
included
studies
the
prevalence
of
rotator
cuff
disorders
was
generally
high
partial
verification
of
patients
was
common
and
in
many
cases
patients
who
were
selected
retrospectively
because
they
had
undergone
the
reference
test
Sample
sizes
were
generally
very
small
Reference
tests
were
often
inappropriate
with
many
studies
using
arthrography
alone
despite
problems
with
its
sensitivity
For
clinical
assessment
10
cohort
studies
were
found
that
examined
either
the
accuracy
of
individual
tests
or
clinical
examination
as
a
whole
individual
tests
were
either
good
at
ruling
out
rotator
cuff
tears
when
negative
(high
sensitivity)
or
at
ruling
in
such
disorders
when
positive
(high
specificity)
but
small
sample
sizes
meant
that
there
was
no
conclusive
evidence
Ultrasound
was
investigated
in
38
cohort
studies
and
found
to
be
most
accurate
when
used
for
the
detection
of
full-thickness
tears
sensitivity
was
lower
for
detection
of
partial-thickness
tears
For
MRI
29
cohort
studies
were
included
For
full-thickness
tears
overall
pooled
sensitivities
and
specificities
were
fairly
high
and
the
studies
were
not
statistically
heterogeneous
however
for
the
detection
of
partial-thickness
rotator
cuff
tears
the
pooled
sensitivity
estimate
was
much
lower
The
results
from
six
MRA
studies
suggested
that
it
may
be
very
accurate
for
detection
of
full-thickness
rotator
cuff
tears
although
its
performance
for
the
detection
of
partial-thickness
tears
was
less
consistent
Direct
evidence
for
the
performance
of
one
test
compared
with
another
is
very
limited
The
results
suggest
that
clinical
examination
by
specialists
can
rule
out
the
presence
of
a
rotator
cuff
tear
and
that
either
MRI
or
ultrasound
could
equally
be
used
for
detection
of
full-thickness
rotator
cuff
tears
although
ultrasound
may
be
better
at
picking
up
partial
tears
Ultrasound
also
may
be
more
cost-effective
in
a
specialist
hospital
setting
for
identification
of
full-thickness
tears
Further
research
suggestions
include
the
need
for
large
well-designed
prospective
studies
of
the
diagnosis
of
shoulder
pain
in
particular
a
follow-up
study
of
patients
with
shoulder
pain
in
primary
care
and
a
prospective
cohort
study
of
clinical
examination
ultrasound
and
MRI
alone
and/or
in
combination
