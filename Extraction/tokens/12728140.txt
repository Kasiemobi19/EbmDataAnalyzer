Sleep
environment
and
the
risk

sudden
infant
death
syndrome
in
an
urban
population
the
Chicago
Infant
Mortality
Study
Abstract
Text
To
examine
risk
factors
for
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(SIDS)
with
the
goal
of
reducing
SIDS
mortality
among
blacks
which
continues
to
affect
this
group
at
twice
the
rate
of
whites
We
analyzed
data
from
a
population-based
case-control
study
of
260
SIDS
deaths
that
occurred
in
Chicago
between
1993
and
1996
and
an
equal
number
of
matched
living
controls
to
determine
the
association
between
SIDS
and
factors
in
the
sleep
environment
and
other
variables
related
to
infant
care
The
racial/ethnic
composition
of
the
study
groups
was
750%
black
131%
Hispanic
white
and
119%
non-Hispanic
white
Several
factors
related
to
the
sleep
environment
during
last
sleep
were
associated
with
higher
risk
of
SIDS

In
a
multivariate
model
several

remained

other

with

and
not
using
a
pacifier
To
lower
further
the
SIDS
rate
among
black
and
other
racial/ethnic
groups
prone
sleeping
the
use
of
soft
bedding
and
pillows
and
some
types
of
bed
sharing
should
be
reduced
