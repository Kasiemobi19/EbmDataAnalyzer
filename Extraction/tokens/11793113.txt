Abstract
Text
Since
1998
mass
urine
screening
tests
have
been
performed
on
Korean
school
children
We
have
analyzed
those
patients
who
showed
abnormal
urinary
findings
in
the
school
screening
program
Between
January
1998
and
January
2000
452
children
with
abnormal
urinary
findings
visited
the
Pediatric
Kidney
Center
Kyung-Hee
University
Hospital
Sex
age
24-h
urine
creatinine
clearance
ultrasonography
Doppler
scans
and
renal
biopsies
were
reviewed
retrospectively
Results
of
initial
urinalysis
are
divided
into
three
groups
solely
hematuria
group
(228
cases
504%)
solely
proteinuria
group
(98
cases
217%)
and
combined
hematuria
and
proteinuria
group
(79
cases
175%)
Among
the
biopsied
cases
the
proportions
representing
renal
parenchymal
diseases
were
as
follows
IgA
nephropathy
113%
mesangial
proliferative
glomerulonephritis
219%
others
38%
Among
the
three
groups
the
combined
hematuria
and
proteinuria
group
had
more
frequent
chronic
renal
disease
(577%)
than
the
other
groups
Chronic
renal
disease
was
detected
in
369%
of
all
visiting
subjects
In
the
school
screening
program
a
significant
number
of
patients
showed
abnormal
urinary
findings
which
were
associated
with
chronic
renal
diseases
especially
in
the
combined
hematuria
and
proteinuria
group
In
conclusion
mass
urine
screening
tests
should
be
mandatory
to
detect
asymptomatic
chronic
renal
disease
in
school
children
