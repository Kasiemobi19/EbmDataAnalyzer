Screening
transvaginal
uterine
ultrasonography
for
identifying
endometrial
pathology
in
postmenopausal
women
Abstract
Text
During
the
last
decade
transvaginal
ultrasonography
(TVS)
has
become
a
widely-used
technique
for
the
evaluation
of
endometrial
histology
The
purposes
of
this
study
were
to
compare
transvaginal
sonographic
evaluation
of
the
endometrium
with
histology
obtained
by
endometrial
biopsy
in
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
and
to
determine
whether
screening
transvaginal
sonography
might
be
useful
in
the
evaluation
of
postmenopausal
women
The
study
included
59
unselected
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
who
attended
the
outpatient
clinic
for
annual
cervical
cytology
at
Ioannina
University
Hospital
Greece
The
women
were
evaluated
by
transvaginal
scans
performed
immediately
before
endometrial
biopsy
In
the
43
women
with
a
histopathological
diagnosis
of
normal
endometrium/inadequate
for
assessment/atrophy
the
mean
endometrial
thickness
was
51
+/-
33
mm
(range
08-138
mm)
whereas
the
corresponding
value
in
the
16
women
with
abnormal
findings
was
176
+/-
43
mm
(range
94-246
mm)
(p<0001)
If
a
9
mm
cut-off
limit
was
used
for
endometrial
thickness
the
sensitivity
specificity
and
positive
predictive
value
were
100%
9069%
and
80%
respectively
TVS
is
a
sensitive
test
for
determining
endometrial
disease
in
asymptomatic
postmenopausal
women
However
well-designed
studies
should
be
conducted
completed
analysed
and
validated
before
a
mass-screening
program
using
TVS
is
implemented
