A
"family-based"
approach
to
the
treatment
of
obese
type
II
diabetic
patients
Abstract
Text
Forty-nine
obese
diabetic
patients
with
obese
spouses
(diabetic
or
nondiabetic)
were
randomly
assigned
to
an
alone
or
together
condition
Patients
in
the
alone
group
participated
by
themselves
in
a
20-week
behavioral
weight
control
program
their
spouses
attended
assessment
sessions
only
Patients
in
the
together
group
attended
the
program
with
their
spouses
both
were
targeted
for
weight
loss
and
taught
social
support
strategies
Weight
losses
of
patients
treated
alone
and
together
did
not
differ
significantly
at
posttreatment
(199
vs
191
lb)
or
1-year
follow-up
(116
vs
70
lb)
However
there
was
a
significant
interaction
of
treatment
and
gender
women
did
better
when
treated
with
their
spouses
whereas
men
did
better
when
treated
alone
A
"family-based"
approach
was
not
effective
for
these
obese
Type
II
diabetic
patients
as
a
whole
but
may
be
helpful
for
women
