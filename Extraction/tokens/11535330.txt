Efficacy
of
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
in
immunocompetent
adults
a
meta-analysis
of
randomized
trials
Abstract
Text
The
use
of
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
(PPV)
is
low
in
some
countries
maybe
because
of
doubts
regarding
its
efficacy
This
meta-analysis
aims
at
combining
evidence
from
randomized
trials
of
PPV
assessing
its
efficacy
in
preventing
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
related
diseases
in
immunocompetent
adults
In
the
fourteen
trials
totalling
48837
patients
retrieved
PPV
prevents
definite
pneumococcal
pneumonia
by
71%
presumptive
pneumococcal
pneumonia
by
40%
and
mortality
due
to
pneumonia
by
32%
but
not
all-cause
pneumonia
or
death
No
preventive
effect
was
seen
in
the
subgroup
of
patients
aged
55
years
or
more
possibly
due
to
a
lack
of
statistical
power
