Comparative
meta-analysis
of
pharmacotherapy
and
behavior
therapy
for
persistent
insomnia
Abstract
Text
Although
four
meta-analytic
reviews
support
the
efficacy
of
pharmacotherapy
and
behavior
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
insomnia
no
meta-analysis
has
evaluated
whether
these
treatment
modalities
yield
comparable
outcomes
during
acute
treatment
The
authors
conducted
a
quantitative
review
of
the
literature
on
the
outcome
of
the
two
treatments
to
compare
the
short-term
efficacy
of
pharmacotherapy
and
behavioral
therapy
in
primary
insomnia
They
identified
studies
from
1966
through
2000
using
MEDLINE
psycINFO
and
bibliographies
Investigations
were
limited
to
studies
using
prospective
measures
and
within-subject
designs
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
benzodiazepines
or
benzodiazepine
receptor
agonists
or
behavioral
treatments
for
primary
insomnia
Benzodiazepine
receptor
agonists
included
zolpidem
zopiclone
and
zaleplon
Behavioral
treatments
included
stimulus
control
and
sleep
restriction
therapies
Twenty-one
studies
summarizing
outcomes
for
470
subjects
met
inclusion
criteria
Weighted
effect
sizes
for
subjective
measures
of
sleep
latency
number
of
awakenings
wake
time
after
sleep
onset
total
sleep
time
and
sleep
quality
before
and
after
treatment
were
moderate
to
large
There
were
no
differences
in
magnitude
between
pharmacological
and
behavioral
treatments
in
any
measures
except
latency
to
sleep
onset
Behavior
therapy
resulted
in
a
greater
reduction
in
sleep
latency
than
pharmacotherapy
Overall
behavior
therapy
and
pharmacotherapy
produce
similar
short-term
treatment
outcomes
in
primary
insomnia
