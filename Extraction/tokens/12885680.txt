A
pilot
randomized
double-blind
comparison
of
a
low-molecular-weight
heparin
a
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
agent
and
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
superficial
vein
thrombosis
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
and
safety
of
antithrombotic
treatment
in
patients
with
superficial
vein
thrombosis
remain
to
be
established
in
adequately
designed
trials
In
a
double-blind
trial
427
patients
older
than
18
years
with
documented
acute
symptomatic
superficial
vein
thrombosis
of
the
legs
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
subcutaneous
enoxaparin
sodium
40
mg
subcutaneous
enoxaparin
15
mg/kg
oral
tenoxicam
or
placebo
once
daily
for
8
to
12
days
The
primary
efficacy
outcome
was
deep
venous
thromboembolism
between
days
1
and
12
defined
as
deep
vein
thrombosis
detected
by
ultrasonography
between
days
8
and
12
or
earlier
if
clinically
indicated
or
documented
symptomatic
pulmonary
embolism
For
the
secondary
efficacy
outcomes
superficial
vein
thrombosis
recurrence
or
extension
was
also
considered
The
incidence
of
deep
venous
thromboembolism
by
day
12
was
36%
(4
of
111
patients)
in
the
placebo
group
09%
(1
of
109
patients)
in
the
40-mg
enoxaparin
group
(P
=37
vs
placebo)
10%
(1
of
102
patients)
in
the
15-mg/kg
enoxaparin
group
(P
=37
vs
placebo)
and
21%
(2
of
94
patients)
in
the
tenoxicam
group
(P
=69
vs
placebo)
The
incidence
of
deep
and
superficial
venous
thromboembolism
by
day
12
was
significantly
reduced
in
all
active
treatment
groups
from
306%
(34
of
111
patients)
in
the
placebo
group
to
83%
(9
of
109
patients)
69%
(7
of
102
patients)
and
149%
(14
of
94
patients)
in
the
40-mg
enoxaparin
(P<001)
15-mg/kg
enoxaparin
(P<001)
and
tenoxicam
(P<01)
groups
respectively
No
death
or
major
hemorrhage
occurred
during
the
study
Treatment
with
a
low-molecular-weight
heparin
or
with
an
oral
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
agent
should
be
evaluated
further
in
the
prevention
of
thromboembolic
complications
in
patients
with
superficial
vein
thrombosis
