Phantom
pain
and
sensation
among
British
veteran
amputees
Abstract
Text
Using
a
mail-delivered
questionnaire
we
surveyed
590
veteran
amputees
concerning
phantom
pain
phantom
sensation
and
stump
pain
They
were
selected
randomly
from
a
population
of
2974
veterans
with
long-standing
limb
amputation(s)
using
a
computer
random
number
generator
Eighty-nine
percent
responded
and
of
these
55%
reported
phantom
limb
pain
and
56%
stump
pain
There
was
a
strong
correlation
between
phantom
pain
and
phantom
sensation
The
intensity
of
phantom
sensation
was
a
significant
predictor
for
the
time
course
of
phantom
pain
In
only
3%
of
phantom
limb
pain
sufferers
did
the
condition
become
worse
One
hundred
and
forty-nine
amputees
reporting
phantom
pain
discussed
their
pain
with
their
family
doctors
49
were
told
that
there
was
no
treatment
available
Transcutaneous
electric
nerve
stimulation
analgesics
and
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
were
satisfactory
methods
for
controlling
phantom
limb
pain
