Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
risk
of
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
in
patients
with
and
without
antiphospholipid
antibodies
Anticardiolipin
antibodies
were
tested
6
months
after
a
first
or
second
episode
of
venous
thromboembolism
Of
the
patients
with
a
first
episode
of
venous
thromboembolism
only
the
412
who
received
6
months
of
anticoagulation
were
studied
Two
hundred
and
eleven
patients
with
a
second
episode
received
oral
anticoagulation
for
6
months
or
indefinitely
The
therapy
was
targeted
at
an
international
normalized
ratio
(INR)
of
20
to
285
All
patients
were
followed
up
for
4
years
after
enrollment
Among
the
412
patients
with
a
first
episode
of
venous
thromboembolism
the
risk
of
recurrence
was
29%
in
patients
with
anticardiolipin
antibodies
and
14%
in
those
without
antibodies
(P
=
00013)
In
those
with
antibodies
there
was
an
increased
risk
during
the
first
6
months
after
cessation
of
anticoagulation
The
risk
of
recurrence
increased
with
the
titer
of
the
antibodies
Four-year
mortality
rate
was
15%
in
those
with
antibodies
and
6%
in
those
without
(P
=
001)
Among
34
patients
with
a
second
event
of
venous
thromboembolism
and
anticardiolipin
antibodies
there
were
no
recurrences
during
anticoagulant
therapy
versus
20%
in
those
who
received
only
6
months
of
treatment
(P
=
008)
The
presence
of
elevated
titers
of
anticardiolipin
antibodies
6
months
after
an
episode
of
venous
thromboembolism
is
a
predictor
for
an
increased
risk
of
recurrence
and
of
death
Patients
with
anticardiolipin
antibodies
and
venous
thromboembolism
seem
to
benefit
from
prolonged
oral
anticoagulation
