Used
infant

sudden
infant

in
Scotland
case-control

Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
proposition
that
a
used
infant
mattress
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
Case-control
study
Scotland
(population
51
million
with
about
53
000
births
a
year)
131
infants
who
died
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
between
1
January
1996
and
31
May
2000
and
278
age
season
and
obstetric
unit
matched
control
infants
Routine
use
of
an
infant
mattress
previously
used
by
another
child
and
place
of
last
sleep
Routine
use
of
an
infant
mattress
previously
used
by
another
child
was
significantly
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(multivariate
odds
ratio
307
95%
confidence
interval
151
to
622)
Use
of
a
used
infant
mattress
for
last
sleep
was
also
associated
with
increased
risk
(610
231
to
1612)
The
association
was
significantly
stronger
if
the
mattress
was
from
another
home
(478
208
to
110)
than
if
it
was
from
the
same
home
(164
064
to
42)
A
valid
significant
association
exists
between
use
of
a
used
infant
mattress
and
an
increased
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
particularly
if
the
mattress
is
from
another
home
Insufficient
evidence
is
available
to
judge
whether
this
relation
is
cause
and
effect
