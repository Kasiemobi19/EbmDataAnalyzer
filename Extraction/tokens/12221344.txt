exercise
and
manipulative
therapy
for
cervicogenic
headache
Abstract
Text
A
multicenter
randomized
controlled
trial
with
unblinded
treatment
and
blinded
outcome
assessment
was
conducted
The
treatment
period
was
6
weeks
with
follow-up
assessment
after
treatment
then
at
3
6
and
12
months
To
determine
the
effectiveness
of
manipulative
therapy
and
a
low-load
exercise
program
for
cervicogenic
headache
when
used
alone
and
in
combination
as
compared
with
a
control
group
Headaches
arising
from
cervical
musculoskeletal
disorders
are
common
Conservative
therapies
are
recommended
as
the
first
treatment
of
choice
Evidence
for
the
effectiveness
of
manipulative
therapy
is
inconclusive
and
available
only
for
the
short
term
There
is
no
evidence
for
exercise
and
no
study
has
investigated
the
effect
of
combined
therapies
for
cervicogenic
headache
In
this
study
200
participants
who
met
the
diagnostic
criteria
for
cervicogenic
headache
were
randomized
into
four
groups
manipulative
therapy
group
exercise
therapy
group
combined
therapy
group
and
a
control
group
The
primary
outcome
was
a
change
in
headache
frequency
Other
outcomes
included
changes
in
headache
intensity
and
duration
the
Northwick
Park
Neck
Pain
Index
medication
intake
and
patient
satisfaction
Physical
outcomes
included
pain
on
neck
movement
upper
cervical
joint
tenderness
a
craniocervical
flexion
muscle
test
and
a
photographic
measure
of
posture
There
were
no
differences
in
headache-related
and
demographic
characteristics
between
the
groups
at
baseline
The
loss
to
follow-up
evaluation
was
35%
At
the
12-month
follow-up
assessment
both
manipulative
therapy
and
specific
exercise
had
significantly
reduced
headache
frequency
and
intensity
and
the
neck
pain
and
effects
were
maintained
(P
<
005
for
all)
The
combined
therapies
was
not
significantly
superior
to
either
therapy
alone
but
10%
more
patients
gained
relief
with
the
combination
Effect
sizes
were
at
least
moderate
and
clinically
relevant
Manipulative
therapy
and
exercise
can
reduce
the
symptoms
of
cervicogenic
headache
and
the
effects
are
maintained
