Abstract
Text
To
study
CT
findings
in
general
practice
patients
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
acute
sinusitis
and
to
examine
the
interobserver
variation
between
2
radiologists
with
regard
to
their
CT
evaluation
Two
hundred
and
one
patients
were
examined
with
coronal
CT
images
of
the
paranasal
sinuses
within
2
days
of
the
clinical
diagnosis
Patients
with
chronic
sinusitis
were
excluded
Fluid
level
or
total
opacification
of
any
sinus
were
used
as
evidence
of
sinusitis
One
hundred
and
twenty-seven
(63%)
patients
had
fluid
level
or
total
opacification
in
a
sinus
region
most
in
more
than
one
region
One
hundred
and
fifteen
had
CT
signs
of
sinusitis
in
the
ethmoid
region
84
in
the
maxillary
18
in
the
frontal
and
10
in
the
sphenoid
Forty-nine
patients
had
a
negative
Ct
In
the
evaluation
of
interobserver
agreement
the
overall
assessment
of
the
CT
yielded
a
kappa
value
of
070
The
study
demonstrated
great
variation
in
the
CT
findings
in
general
practice
patients
with
suspected
acute
sinusitis
More
than
one
sinus
region
was
affected
in
most
patients
in
whom
sinusitis
was
confirmed
by
CT
imaging
the
most
common
combination
was
ethmoid
and
maxillary
sinuses
The
interobserver
agreement
was
substantial
