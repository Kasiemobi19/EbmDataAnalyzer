Glucosamine
and
chondroitin
for
treatment
of
osteoarthritis
a
systematic
quality
assessment
and
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Glucosamine
and
chondroitin
preparations
are
widely
touted
in
the
lay
press
as
remedies
for
osteoarthritis
(OA)
but
uncertainty
about
their
efficacy
exists
among
the
medical
community
To
evaluate
benefit
of
glucosamine
and
chondroitin
preparations
for
OA
symptoms
using
meta-analysis
combined
with
systematic
quality
assessment
of
clinical
trials
of
these
preparations
in
knee
and/or
hip
OA
We
searched
for
human
clinical
trials
in
MEDLINE
(1966
to
June
1999)
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
using
the
terms
osteoarthritis
osteoarthrosis
degenerative
arthritis
glucosamine
chondroitin
and
glycosaminoglycans
We
also
manually
searched
review
articles
manuscripts
and
supplements
from
rheumatology
and
OA
journals
and
sought
unpublished
data
by
contacting
content
experts
study
authors
and
manufacturers
of
glucosamine
or
chondroitin
Studies
were
included
if
they
were
published
or
unpublished
double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
of
4
or
more
weeks'
duration
that
tested
glucosamine
or
chondroitin
for
knee
or
hip
OA
and
reported
extractable
data
on
the
effect
of
treatment
on
symptoms
Fifteen
of
37
studies
were
included
in
the
analysis
Reviewers
performed
data
extraction
and
scored
each
trial
using
a
quality
assessment
instrument
We
computed
an
effect
size
from
the
intergroup
difference
in
mean
outcome
values
at
trial
end
divided
by
the
SD
of
the
outcome
value
in
the
placebo
group
(02
small
effect
05
moderate
08
large)
and
applied
a
correction
factor
to
reduce
bias
We
tested
for
trial
heterogeneity
and
publication
bias
and
stratified
for
trial
quality
and
size
We
pooled
effect
sizes
using
a
random
effects
model
Quality
scores
ranged
from
123%
to
554%
of
the
maximum
with
a
mean
(SD)
of
355%
(12%)
Only
1
study
described
adequate
allocation
concealment
and
2
reported
an
intent-to-treat
analysis
Most
were
supported
or
performed
by
a
manufacturer
Funnel
plots
showed
significant
asymmetry
(P<
or
=01)
compatible
with
publication
bias
Tests
for
heterogeneity
were
nonsignificant
after
removing
1
outlier
trial
The
aggregated
effect
sizes
were
044
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
024-064)
for
glucosamine
and
078
(95%
CI
060-095)
for
chondroitin
but
they
were
diminished
when
only
high-quality
or
large
trials
were
considered
The
effect
sizes
were
relatively
consistent
for
pain
and
functional
outcomes
Trials
of
glucosamine
and
chondroitin
preparations
for
OA
symptoms
demonstrate
moderate
to
large
effects
but
quality
issues
and
likely
publication
bias
suggest
that
these
effects
are
exaggerated
Nevertheless
some
degree
of
efficacy
appears
probable
for
these
preparations
