Does
age
play
a
role
in
recovery
from
sports-related
concussion
A

Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
symptoms
and
neurocognitive
recovery
patterns
after
sports-related
concussion
in
high
school
and
college
athletes
College
athletes
(n
=
371)
and
high
school
athletes
(n
=
183)
underwent
baseline
neuropsychological
evaluation
between
1997
and
2000
Individuals
who
received
a
concussion
during
athletic
competition
(n
=
54)
underwent
serial
neuropsychologic
evaluation
after
injury
and
were
compared
with
a
noninjured
within-sample
control
group
(n
=
38)
Main
outcome
measures
included
structured
interview
four
memory
measures
and
Concussion
Symptom
Scale
ratings
Baseline
to
postinjury
change
scores
and
multiple
analyses
of
variance
were
used
to
compare
recovery
curves
within
and
between
groups
High
school
athletes
with
concussion
had
prolonged
memory
dysfunction
compared
with
college
athletes
with
concussion
High
school
athletes
performed
significantly
worse
than
age-matched
control
subjects
at
7
days
after
injury
(F
=
290
P
<005)
College
athletes
despite
having
more
severe
in-season
concussions
displayed
commensurate
performance
with
matched
control
subjects
by
day
3
after
concussion
Self-report
of
postconcussion
symptoms
by
student
athletes
was
not
predictive
of
poor
performance
on
neuropsychologic
testing
Caution
and
systematic
evaluation
should
be
undertaken
before
returning
athletes
with
concussion
to
competition
Sole
reliance
on
the
self-report
of
the
athlete
may
be
inadequate
Preliminary
data
may
suggest
a
more
protracted
recovery
from
concussion
in
high
school
athletes
