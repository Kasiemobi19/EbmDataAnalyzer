Methylphenidate
dosage
for
children
with
ADHD
over
time
under
controlled
conditions
lessons
from
the
MTA
Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
trajectory
of
methylphenidate
(MPH)
dosage
over
time
following
a
controlled
titration
and
to
ascertain
how
accurately
the
titration
was
able
to
predict
effective
long-term
treatment
in
children
with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
Using
the
14-month-treatment
database
of
the
NIMH
Collaborative
Multisite
Multimodal
Treatment
Study
of
Children
With
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder
(MTA)
the
outcome
of
the
initial
placebo-controlled
double-blind
randomized
daily
switch
titration
of
MPH
was
compared
with
the
subsequent
maintenance
pharmacotherapy
Children
received
monthly
monitoring
visits
and
when
needed
medication
adjustments
Of
the
198
children
for
whom
MPH
was
the
optimal
treatment
at
titration
(mean
+/-
SD
dose
305
+/-
142
mg/day)
88%
were
still
taking
MPH
at
the
end
of
maintenance
(mean
dose
344
+/-
133
mg/day)
Titration-determined
dose
and
end-of-maintenance
dose
were
significantly
correlated
(r
=
052-068)
Children
receiving
combined
pharmacotherapy
and
behavioral
treatment
ended
maintenance
on
a
lower
dose
(311
+/-
117
mg/day)
than
did
children
receiving
pharmacotherapy
only
(381
+/-
142
mg/day)
Of
the
230
children
for
whom
titration
identified
an
optimal
treatment
17%
continued
both
the
assigned
medication
and
dosage
throughout
maintenance
The
mean
number
of
pharmacological
changes
per
child
was
28
+/-
18
(SD)
and
time
to
first
change
was
47
months
+/-
03
(SE)
For
most
children
initial
titration
found
a
dose
of
MPH
in
the
general
range
of
the
effective
maintenance
dose
but
did
not
prevent
the
need
for
subsequent
maintenance
adjustments
For
optimal
pharmacological
treatment
of
ADHD
both
careful
initial
titration
and
ongoing
medication
management
are
needed
