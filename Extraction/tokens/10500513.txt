Characteristics
and
quality
of
Papanicolaou
smears
obtained
by
primary
care
clinicians
using
a
single
commercial
laboratory
Abstract
Text
Few
data
are
available
on
factors
associated
with
the
quality
of
Papanicolaou
smears
performed
in
primary
care
To
identify
the
patterns
and
proficiency
of
cervical
cancer
screening
among
different
primary
care
specialties
Clinical
and
cytologic
data
from
21833
Papanicolaou
smears
submitted
to
a
single
large
commercial
laboratory
by
176
clinicians
during
a
7-month
period
were
correlated
with
individual
clinician
and
specialty
characteristics
according
to
indexes
of
specimen
quality
Obstetrician-gynecologists
nurse
practitioners
and
physician
assistants
provided
screening
to
a
younger
population
of
women
compared
with
family
physicians
internists
and
general
practitioners
Factors
positively
associated
with
a
greater
probability
of
a
"satisfactory"
smear
or
the
presence
of
endocervical
cells
(as
a
marker
of
adequate
sampling)
were
increasing
patient
age
use
of
the
cytobrush
and
the
specialty
of
the
obstetrician-gynecologist
Satisfactory
smears
were
not
associated
with
any
increased
identification
of
cytologic
abnormalities
compared
with
"limited"
smears
In
contrast
smears
with
endocervical
cells
showed
a
higher
proportion
of
abnormalities
compared
with
specimens
without
such
cells
Differences
in
the
performance
of
obtaining
Papanicolaou
smears
exist
between
primary
care
specialties
but
need
further
clarification
The
use
of
the
cytobrush
and
the
presence
of
endocervical
cells
are
criteria
that
reflect
clinician
proficiency
more
realistically
than
the
laboratory
criterion
of
satisfactory
smear
