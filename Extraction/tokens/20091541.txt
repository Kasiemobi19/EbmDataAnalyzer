Title
Symptomatic
treatment
of
the
cough
in
whooping
cough
Abstract
Text
The
worldwide
incidence
of
whooping
cough
(pertussis)
has
been
estimated
at
485
million
cases
and
nearly
295000
deaths
per
year
In
low-income
countries
the
case-fatality
rate
among
infants
may
be
as
high
as
4%
Much
of
the
morbidity
of
whooping
cough
in
children
and
adults
is
due
to
the
effects
of
the
paroxysmal
cough
Cough
treatments
proposed
include
corticosteroids
beta
2-adrenergic
agonists
pertussis-specific
immunoglobulin
antihistamines
and
possibly
leukotriene
receptor
antagonists
(LTRAs)
To
assess
the
effectiveness
and
safety
of
interventions
to
reduce
the
severity
of
paroxysmal
cough
in
whooping
cough
in
children
and
adults
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
(The
Cochrane

which
contains
the

Randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
and
quasi-RCTs
of
any
intervention
(excluding
antibiotics
and
vaccines)
to
suppress
the
cough
in
whooping
cough
Two
review
authors
(SB
MT)
independently
selected
trials
extracted
data
and
assessed
the
quality
of
each
trial
The
primary
outcome
was
frequency
of
paroxysms
of
coughing
Secondary
outcomes
were
frequency
of
vomiting
frequency
of
whoop
frequency
of
cyanosis
(turning
blue)
development
of
serious
complications
mortality
from
any
cause
side
effects
due
to
medication
admission
to
hospital
and
duration
of
hospital
stay
Ten
trials
were
included
of
varying
sample
sizes
(N
=
9
to
135)
from
high-income
countries
Study
quality
was
generally
poor
Included
studies
did
not
show
a
statistically
significant
benefit
for
any
of
the
interventions
Diphenhydramine
did
not
change
coughing
episodes
the
mean
difference
of
coughing
spells
per
24
hours
was
19
(95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
-
47
to
85)
One
study
on
pertussis
immunoglobulin
reported
a
possible
mean
reduction
of
-31
whoops
per
24
hours
(95%
CI
-62
to
002)
but
no
change
in
hospital
stay
(-07
days)
(95%
CI
-38
to
24)
Dexamethasone
did
not
show
a
clear
decrease
in
length
of
hospital
stay
(-35
days)
(95%
CI
-153
to
84)
and
salbutamol
showed
no
change
in
coughing
paroxysms
per
24
hours
(-022)
(95%
CI
-413
to
369)
Insufficient
evidence
exists
to
draw
conclusions
about
the
effects
of
interventions
for
the
cough
in
whooping
cough
