Home
intervention
in
the
treatment

asthma
among
inner-city
children
Abstract
Text
In
Atlanta
as
in
other
major
urban
areas
of
the
United
States
asthma
is
a
leading
cause
of
school
absenteeism
emergency
department
use
and
hospitalization
Recent
guidelines
for
asthma
management
recommend
reducing
exposure
to
relevant
allergens
but
neither
the
feasibility
nor
the
efficacy
of
this
form
of
treatment
has
been
established
for
children
living
in
poverty
We
sought
to
investigate
allergen
avoidance
as
a
treatment
for
asthma
among
inner-city
children
One
hundred
four
children
with
asthma
living
in
the
city
of
Atlanta
were
enrolled
into
a
controlled
trial
of
avoidance
without
being
skin
tested
The
children
were
randomized
to
an
active
avoidance
group
a
placebo
avoidance
group
and
a
second
control
group
for
which
no
house
visits
occurred
until
the
end
of
the
first
year
Avoidance
included
bed
and
pillow
covers
hot
washing
of
bedding
and
cockroach
bait
Eighty-five
children
completed
the
study
and
the
outcome
was
measured
as
unscheduled
clinic
visits
emergency
department
visits
and
hospitalization
for
asthma
as
well
as
changes
in
mite
and
cockroach
allergen
levels
There
was
a
significant
decrease
in
acute
visits
for
asthma
among
children
whose
homes
were
visited
(P
<
001)
However
there
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
active
and
placebo
homes
either
in
the
effect
on
asthma
visits
or
in
allergen
concentrations
When
the
children
with
mite
allergy
were
considered
separately
there
was
a
significant
correlation
between
decreased
mite
allergen
and
change
in
acute
visits
(P
<
01)
The
avoidance
measures
for
cockroach
allergen
appeared
to
be
ineffective
and
the
changes
observed
did
not
correlate
with
changes
in
visits
Applying
allergen
avoidance
as
a
treatment
for
asthma
among
children
living
in
poverty
is
difficult
because
of
multiple
sensitivities
and
problems
applying
the
protocols
in
this
environment
The
current
results
demonstrate
that
home
visiting
positively
influences
the
management
of
asthma
among
families
living
in
poverty
Furthermore
the
results
for
children
with
mite
allergy
strongly
suggest
that
decreasing
relevant
allergen
exposure
should
be
an
objective
of
treatment
in
this
population
