Medication
treatment
strategies
in
the
MTA
Study
relevance
to
clinicians
and
researchers
Abstract
Text
Clinicians
have
difficulty
applying
drug
research
findings
to
clinical
practice
because
research
protocols
use
methods
different
from
those
used
in
daily
office
practice
settings
To
design
a
medication
protocol
for
a
multisite
clinical
trial
involving
576
children
with
attention-deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
while
maintaining
relevance
to
clinical
practice
investigators
from
the
NIMH
Collaborative
Multisite
Multimodal
Treatment
Study
of
Children
with
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder
(MTA
study)
developed
novel
medication
strategies
These
were
designed
to
work
either
in
a
monomodal
or
multimodal
format
and
to
ensure
standard
approaches
are
used
across
diverse
sites
Each
child
randomized
to
medication
(projected
N
=
288)
is
individually
titrated
to
his
or
her
"best"
methylphenidate
dose
and
has
individual
ADHD
symptoms
monitored
Decision
rules
were
developed
to
guide
"best
dose"
selection
dose
changes
medication
changes
the
management
of
side
effects
and
integration
with
psychosocial
treatments
The
MTA
study
uses
a
controlled
method
to
standardize
the
identification
of
each
child's
"best"
methylphenidate
dose
in
a
national
multisite
cooperative
treatment
program
Although
the
titration
protocol
is
complex
the
study's
individual
dosing
approach
and
algorithms
for
openly
managing
ADHD
children's
medication
over
time
will
be
of
interest
to
clinicians
in
office
practice
