A
comparison
of
three
months
of
anticoagulation
with
extended
anticoagulation
for
a
first
episode
of
idiopathic
venous
thromboembolism
Abstract
Text
Patients
who
have
a
first
episode
of
venous
thromboembolism
in
the
absence
of
known
risk
factors
for
thrombosis
(idiopathic
thrombosis)
are
often
treated
with
anticoagulant
therapy
for
three
months
Such
patients
may
benefit
from
longer
treatment
however
because
they
appear
to
have
an
increased
risk
of
recurrence
after
anticoagulant
therapy
is
stopped
In
this
double-blind
study
we
randomly
assigned
patients
who
had
completed
3
months
of
anticoagulant
therapy
for
a
first
episode
of
idiopathic
venous
thromboembolism
to
continue
receiving
warfarin
with
the
dose
adjusted
to
achieve
an
international
normalized
ratio
of
20
to
30
or
to
receive
placebo
for
a
further
24
months
Our
goal
was
to
determine
the
effects
of
extended
anticoagulant
therapy
on
rates
of
recurrent
symptomatic
venous
thromboembolism
and
bleeding
A
prespecified
interim
analysis
of
efficacy
led
to
the
early
termination
of
the
trial
after
162
patients
had
been
enrolled
and
followed
for
an
average
of
10
months
Of
83
patients
assigned
to
continue
to
receive
placebo
17
had
a
recurrent
episode
of
venous
thromboembolism
(274
percent
per
patient-year)
as
compared
with
1
of
79
patients
assigned
to
receive
warfarin
(13
percent
per
patient-year
P<0001)
Warfarin
resulted
in
a
95
percent
reduction
in
the
risk
of
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
(95
percent
confidence
interval
63
to
99
percent)
Three
patients
assigned
to
the
warfarin
group
had
nonfatal
major
bleeding
(two
had
gastrointestinal
bleeding
and
one
genitourinary
bleeding)
as
compared
with
none
of
those
assigned
to
the
placebo
group
(38
vs
0
percent
per
patient-year
P=009)
Patients
with
a
first
episode
of
idiopathic
venous
thromboembolism
should
be
treated
with
anticoagulant
agents
for
longer
than
three
months
