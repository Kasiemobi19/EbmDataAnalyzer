A
randomised
controlled
trial
of
the
effectiveness
of
providing
free
fluoride
toothpaste
from
the
age
of
12
months
on
reducing
caries
in
5-6

children
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
impact
of
regularly
supplying
free
fluoride
toothpaste
regularly
to
children
initially
aged
12
months
and
living
in
deprived
areas
of
the
north
west
of
England
on
the
level
of
caries
in
the
deciduous
dentition
at
5-6
years
of
age
A
further
aim
was
to
compare
the
effectiveness
of
a
programme
using
a
toothpaste
containing
440
ppmF
(Colgate
0-6
Gel)
with
one
containing
1450
ppmF
(Colgate
Great
Regular
Flavour)
in
reducing
caries
Randomised
controlled
parallel
group
clinical
trial
Clinical
data
were
collected
from
test
and
control
groups
when
the
children
were
5-6
years
old
A
programme
of
posting
toothpaste
with
dental
health
messages
to
the
homes
of
children
initially
aged
12
months
Clinical
examinations
took
place
in
primary
schools
7422
children
born
in
3-month
birth
cohorts
living
in
high
caries
areas
in
nine
health
districts
in
north
west
England
Within
each
district
children
were
randomly
assigned
to
test
or
control
groups
Toothpaste
containing
either
440
ppmF
or
1450
ppmF
and
dental
health
literature
posted
at
three
monthly
intervals
to
children
in
test
groups
until
they
were
aged
5-6
years
The
dmft
index
missing
teeth
and
the
prevalence
of
caries
experience
An
analysis
of
3731
children
who
were
examined
and
remained
in
the
programme
showed
the
mean
dmft
to
be
215
for
the
group
who
had
received
1450
ppmF
toothpaste
and
249
for
the
440
ppmF
group
The
mean
dmft
for
the
control
group
was
257
This
16%
reduction
between
the
1450
ppmF
and
control
group
was
statistically
significant
(P<005)
The
difference
between
the
440
ppmF
group
and
control
was
not
significant
Further
analyses
to
estimate
the
population
effect
of
the
programme
also
confirmed
this
relationship
This
study
demonstrates
that
a
programme
distributing
free
toothpaste
containing
1450
ppmF
provides
a
significant
clinical
benefit
for
high
caries
risk
children
living
in
deprived
non-fluoridated
districts
