Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
efficacy
of
physiotherapy
compared
with
a
wait
and
see
approach
or
corticosteroid
injections
over
52
weeks
in
tennis
elbow
Single
blind
randomised
controlled
trial
Community
setting
Brisbane
Australia
198
participants
aged
18
to
65
years
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
tennis
elbow
of
a
minimum
six
weeks'
duration
who
had
not
received
any
other
active
treatment
by
a
health
practitioner
in
the
previous
six
months
Eight
sessions
of
physiotherapy
corticosteroid
injections
or
wait
and
see
Global
improvement
grip
force
and
assessor's
rating
of
severity
measured
at
baseline
six
weeks
and
52
weeks
Corticosteroid
injection
showed
significantly
better
effects
at
six
weeks
but
with
high
recurrence
rates
thereafter
(47/65
of
successes
subsequently
regressed)
and
significantly
poorer
outcomes
in
the
long
term
compared
with
physiotherapy
Physiotherapy
was
superior
to
wait
and
see
in
the
short
term
no
difference
was
seen
at
52
weeks
when
most
participants
in
both
groups
reported
a
successful
outcome
Participants
who
had
physiotherapy
sought
less
additional
treatment
such
as
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
than
did
participants
who
had
wait
and
see
or
injections
Physiotherapy
combining
elbow
manipulation
and
exercise
has
a
superior
benefit
to
wait
and
see
in
the
first
six
weeks
and
to
corticosteroid
injections
after
six
weeks
providing
a
reasonable
alternative
to
injections
in
the
mid
to
long
term
The
significant
short
term
benefits
of
corticosteroid
injection
are
paradoxically
reversed
after
six
weeks
with
high
recurrence
rates
implying
that
this
treatment
should
be
used
with
caution
in
the
management
of
tennis
elbow
