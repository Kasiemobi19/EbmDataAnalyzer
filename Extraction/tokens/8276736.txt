Improvement
in
fluoxetine-associated
sexual
dysfunction
in
patients
switched
to
bupropion
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
conducted
to
determine
the
effect
of
bupropion
on
the
sexual
functioning
of
male
and
female
outpatients
who
developed
anorgasmia
or
delayed
orgasm
while
receiving
fluoxetine
treatment
for
depression
Thirty-nine
patients
who
satisfied
criteria
for
participation
in
the
study
discontinued
fluoxetine
treatment
and
entered
a
2-week
washout
phase
followed
by
an
open
8-week
bupropion
treatment
phase
Three
parameters
of
sexual
functioning
were
followed
throughout
the
study
orgasm
function
libido
and
satisfaction
with
overall
sexual
functioning
Depression
was
also
evaluated
at
each
visit
All
patients
reported
orgasm
delay
and/or
failure
at
the
time
of
fluoxetine
discontinuation
Orgasm
function
libido
and
satisfaction
with
sexual
functioning
improved
during
the
2-week
fluoxetine
washout
period
and
during
the
bupropion
treatment
phase
Ninety-four
percent
of
patients
(29/31)
had
complete
or
partial
resolution
of
their
orgasm
dysfunction
at
the
end
of
bupropion
treatment
and
81%
of
patients
(25/31)
were
"much"
or
"very
much"
more
satisfied
with
their
overall
sexual
functioning
Most
patients
entered
the
study
with
decreased
libido
on
fluoxetine
Libido
was
"much"
or
"very
much"
increased
for
81%
of
patients
(25/31)
at
the
end
of
the
study
In
addition
depression
scores
on
the
Hamilton
Rating
Scale
for
Depression
and
Clinical
Global
Impressions-Severity
scale
significantly
improved
during
the
bupropion
treatment
phase
Finally
bupropion
was
well
tolerated
by
most
patients
Bupropion
may
be
an
appropriate
antidepressant
for
patients
who
develop
sexual
dysfunction
during
fluoxetine
treatment
or
for
whom
sexual
dysfunction
is
a
concern
