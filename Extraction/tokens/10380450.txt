Abstract
Text
Evening
primrose
oil
is
widely
used
by
many
midwives
to
hasten
cervical
ripening
in
an
effort
to
shorten
labor
and
decrease
the
incidence
of
postdates
pregnancies
Although
its
efficacy
has
been
studied
in
the
relief
of
symptoms
of
a
number
of
medical
conditions
its
use
has
not
been
well
studied
if
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
cervical
ripening
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
effect
of
oral
evening
primrose
oil
on
the
length
of
pregnancy
and
selected
intrapartum
outcomes
in
low-risk
nulliparous
women
A
two
group
retrospective
quasi-experimental
design
conducted
on
a
sample
of
women
who
received
care
in
a
birth
center
compared
selected
outcomes
of
54
women
taking
evening
primrose
oil
in
their
pregnancy
with
a
control
group
of
54
women
who
did
not
Findings
suggest
that
the
oral
administration
of
evening
primrose
oil
from
the
37th
gestational
week
until
birth
does
not
shorten
gestation
or
decrease
the
overall
length
of
labor
Further
the
use
of
orally
administered
evening
primrose
oil
may
be
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
incidence
of
prolonged
rupture
of
membranes
oxytocin
augmentation
arrest
of
descent
and
vacuum
extraction
