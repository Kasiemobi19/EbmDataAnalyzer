pregnant
women

according
to
the
population
studied
and
the
criteria
used
for
confirming
the
diagnosis
(12)
This
complication
may
result
in
significant
maternal
fetal
and
neonatal
morbidity
and
mortality
There
has
been
confusion
over
the
terminology
and
criteria
used
to
diagnose
this
complication
as
well
as
the
benefit
and
potential
harm
of
treatment
during
pregnancy
The
purpose
of
this
document
is
to
review
the
effects
of
chronic
hypertension
on
pregnancy
to
clarify
the
terminology
and
criteria
used
to
define
and
diagnose
it
during
pregnancy
and
to
review
the
available
evidence
for
treatment
options
