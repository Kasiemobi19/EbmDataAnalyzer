Title
Effect
of
treatment
of
gestational
diabetes
mellitus
on
pregnancy
outcomes
Abstract
Text
We
conducted
a
randomized
clinical
trial
to
determine
whether
treatment
of
women
with
gestational
diabetes
mellitus
reduced
the
risk
of
perinatal
complications
We
randomly
assigned
women
between
24
and
34
weeks'
gestation
who
had
gestational
diabetes
to
receive
dietary
advice
blood
glucose
monitoring
and
insulin
therapy
as
needed
(the
intervention
group)
or
routine
care
Primary
outcomes
included
serious
perinatal
complications
(defined
as
death
shoulder
dystocia
bone
fracture
and
nerve
palsy)
admission
to
the
neonatal
nursery
jaundice
requiring
phototherapy
induction
of
labor
cesarean
birth
and
maternal
anxiety
depression
and
health
status
The
rate
of
serious
perinatal
complications
was
significantly
lower
among
the
infants
of
the
490
women
in
the
intervention
group
than
among
the
infants
of
the
510
women
in
the
routine-care
group
(1
percent
vs
4
percent
relative
risk
adjusted
for
maternal
age
race
or
ethnic
group
and
parity
033
95
percent
confidence
interval
014
to
075
P=001)
However
more
infants
of
women
in
the
intervention
group
were
admitted
to
the
neonatal
nursery
(71
percent
vs
61
percent
adjusted
relative
risk
113
95
percent
confidence
interval
103
to
123
P=001)
Women
in
the
intervention
group
had
a
higher
rate
of
induction
of
labor
than
the
women
in
the
routine-care
group
(39
percent
vs
29
percent
adjusted
relative
risk
136
95
percent
confidence
interval
115
to
162
P<0001)
although
the
rates
of
cesarean
delivery
were
similar
(31
percent
and
32
percent
respectively
adjusted
relative
risk
097
95
percent
confidence
interval
081
to
116
P=073)
At
three
months
post
partum
data
on
the
women's
mood
and
quality
of
life
available
for
573
women
revealed
lower
rates
of
depression
and
higher
scores
consistent
with
improved
health
status
in
the
intervention
group
Treatment
of
gestational
diabetes
reduces
serious
perinatal
morbidity
and
may
also
improve
the
woman's
health-related
quality
of
life
