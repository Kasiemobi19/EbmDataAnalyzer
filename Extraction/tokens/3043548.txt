Abstract
Text
The
bird's
nest
inferior
vena
cava
filter
in
clinical
trial
since
1982
has
been
placed
in
568
patients
at
risk
for
pulmonary
embolism
Of
the
481
patients
in
whom
the
filter
had
been
in
place
for
6
months
or
more
440
were
followed
up
clinically
The
prevalence
of
clinically
suspected
recurrent
pulmonary
thromboembolism
was
27%
(12
patients)
and
that
of
inferior
vena
cava
filter
occlusion
was
29%
(13
patients)
With
the
initial
filter
design
filter
migration
occurred
in
five
patients
No
migrations
have
occurred
in
the
147
patients
treated
with
the
filter
after
its
modification
to
improve
the
anchoring
system
for
greater
stability
The
bird's
nest
filter
has
proved
safe
and
effective
in
the
prevention
of
pulmonary
embolism
