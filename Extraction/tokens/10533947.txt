The
advisability
of
implementing
cholesterol
screening
in
school-age
children
and
adolescents
with
a
family
history
of
cardiovascular
disease
and
hyperlipidaemia
Abstract
Text
The
family
basis
of
coronary
heart
disease
is
well
recognized
and
it
is
important
for
family
physicians
to
assess
whether
children
have
elevated
cholesterol
levels
We
aimed
to
evaluate
the
advisability
of
implementing
cholesterol
screening
in
children
with
a
family
history
of
cardiovascular
disease
and
hyperlipidaemia
We
conducted
a
cross-sectional
study
in
Taiwan
from
February
to
June
1996
There
were
47800
students
in
the
population
A
total
of
4520
students
were
recruited
by
two-stage
sampling
All
the
participants
were
required
to
fill
out
a
structured
questionnaire
The
response
rate
was
925%
Our
results
show
that
16-18%
of
the
children
had
a
positive
family
history
of
cardiovascular
disease
or
hyperlipidaemia
Children
with
a
family
history
of
hyperlipidaemia
were
significantly
more
likely
to
have
elevated
total
cholesterol
and
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
than
those
without
such
a
history
(both
odds
ratios
14
P
<
005)
Positive
predictive
values
of
hyperlipidaemia
were
less
than
13%
based
on
family
history
More
than
75%
of
children
with
abnormal
lipid
levels
would
be
missed
The
data
suggest
that
parents'
self-reported
family
history
is
an
ineffective
means
of
identifying
children
with
elevated
serum
lipid
levels
in
Taiwan
Further
research
and
modification
of
current
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
Panel
guidelines
for
selective
cholesterol
screening
in
children
may
be
warranted
