Additive
hypotensive
effect
of
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibition
and
angiotensin-receptor
antagonism
in
essential
hypertension
Abstract
Text
The
study
was
designed
to
assess
the
antihypertensive
effect
of
combined
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
(ACE)
inhibition
and
angiotensin
II
type
1
receptor
(AT1)
antagonism
in
patients
with
essential
hypertension
Twenty
patients
with
uncontrolled
ambulatory
diastolic
blood
pressure
(BP)
after
6
weeks
of
ACE
inhibitor
monotherapy
(benazepril
20
mg
od)
were
randomized
to
receive
double-blind
valsartan
80
mg
od
(AT1
antagonist)
or
matching
placebo
for
5
weeks
while
continuing
to
receive
background
benazepril
Then
patients
crossed
over
to
the
alternative
regimen
for
a
second
5-week
period
The
24-h
ambulatory
BP
was
monitored
on
the
final
day
of
the
benazepril
monotherapy
period
and
on
the
final
day
of
each
double-blind
treatment
period
Valsartan
added
to
benazepril
produced
a
significant
antihypertensive
effect
with
a
benefit
over
placebo
of
65
+/-
126/45
+/-
80
mm
Hg
(systolic/diastolic)
for
average
awake
ambulatory
BP
(p
<
005)
71
+/-
94/56
+/-
65
mm
Hg
for
asleep
BP
(p
<
001)
and
68
+/-
97/49
+/-
68
mm
Hg
for
average
24-h
ambulatory
BP
(p
<
001)
Pulse
rate
was
unaffected
Plasma
active
renin
was
higher
on
the
benazepril-valsartan
combination
compared
with
benazepril-placebo
(p
<
005)
There
was
no
change
in
routine
biochemical
variables
when
valsartan
was
added
to
benazepril
Six
patients
reported
mild
dizziness
or
fatigue
(three
also
with
placebo)
These
data
suggest
that
in
hypertensive
patients
uncontrolled
with
an
ACE
inhibitor
the
addition
of
an
AT1
antagonist
provides
a
powerful
and
safe
antihypertensive
drug
combination
