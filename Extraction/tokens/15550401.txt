Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
evidence
from
controlled
trials
on
the
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
parenteral
metoclopramide
for
acute
migraine
in
adults

Randomised
controlled
trials
of
parenteral
metoclopramide
for
acute
migraine
in
adults
We
reviewed
596
potentially
relevant
abstracts
and
found
13
eligible
trials
totalling
655
adults
In
studies
comparing
metoclopramide
with
placebo
metoclopramide
was
more
likely
to
provide
significant
reduction
in
migraine
pain
(odds
ratio
284
95%
confidence
interval
105
to
768)
Used
as
the
only
agent
metoclopramide
showed
mixed
effectiveness
when
compared
with
other
single
agents
Heterogeneity
of
studies
for
combination
treatment
prevented
statistical
pooling
Treatments
that
did
include
metoclopramide
were
as
or
more
effective
than
comparison
treatments
for
pain
nausea
and
relapse
outcomes
reported
in
all
studies
Metoclopramide
is
an
effective
treatment
for
migraine
headache
and
may
be
effective
when
combined
with
other
treatments
Given
its
non-narcotic
and
antiemetic
properties
metoclopramide
should
be
considered
a
primary
agent
in
the
treatment
of
acute
migraines
in
emergency
departments
