Effect
of
exclusive
breast-feeding
and
early
solid
food
avoidance
on
the
incidence
of
atopic
dermatitis
in
high-risk
infants
at
1
year
of
age
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
preventive
effect
of
exclusive
breast-feeding
and
early
solid
food
avoidance
on
atopic
dermatitis
(AD)
in
infancy
This
study
is
part
of
a
dietary
clinical
trial
in
a
prospective
cohort
of
healthy
term
newborns
at
risk
of
atopy
It
was
recommended
to
breast-feed
for
at
least
4
months
and
to
avoid
solid
food
in
the
same
time-period
Eight
hundred
and
sixty-five
infants
exclusively
breast-fed
and
256
infants
partially
or
exclusively
formula-fed
were
followed-up
until
the
end
of
the
first
year
following
birth
AD
and
sensitization
to
milk
and
egg
were
considered
as
study
end-points
The
1-year
incidence
of
AD
was
compared
between
the
two
study
groups
Adjusted
odds
ratios
(OR)
with
95%
confidence
intervals
(CI)
were
calculated
by
multiple
logistic
regression
The
incidence
of
AD
was
calculated
in
relation
to
age
at
introduction
of
solid
food
and
amount
of
food
given
In
the
breast-fed
group
the
adjusted
OR
for
AD
was
047
(95%
CI
030-074)
The
strongest
risk
factor
was
the
occurrence
of
AD
in
the
subject's
core
family
The
risk
of
infants
with
AD
to
be
sensitized
to
milk
was
four
times
higher
and
to
egg
eight
times
higher
than
in
infants
without
AD
Age
at
first
introduction
of
solid
food
and
diversity
of
solid
food
showed
no
effect
on
AD
incidence
We
conclude
that
in
infants
at
atopic
risk
exclusive
breast-feeding
for
at
least
4
months
is
effective
in
preventing
AD
in
the
first
year
of
life
