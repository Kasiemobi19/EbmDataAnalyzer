Treating
mood
disorders
during
pregnancy
safety
considerations
Abstract
Text
Mood
disorders
in
pregnancy
may
have
a
negative
effect
on
self
care
and
pregnancy
outcome
that
affects
the
mother
directly
and
the
child
indirectly
Thus
some
women
may
require
pharmacological
treatment
Pharmacotherapy
of
mood
disorders
during
pregnancy
implies
specific
considerations
This
paper
presents
an
updated
review
of
available
studies
on
the
treatment
of
mood
disorders
and
present
knowledge
on
teratogenicity
neonatal
effects
and
long-term
neurobehavioural
effects
for
the
different
psychotropic
drugs
including
treatment
with
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
tricyclic
antidepressants
(TCAs)
other
antidepressants
benzodiazepines
lithium
carbamazepine/valproic
acid
lamotrigine
and
novel
antipsychotics
However
the
existing
knowledge
on
the
use
of
antidepressants
and
mood
stabilising
agents
during
pregnancy
is
hampered
by
a
lack
of
results
from
randomised
controlled
trialsSSRIs
and
TCAs
have
not
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
major
malformations
but
poor
neonatal
adaptation
has
been
described
Benzodiazepines
used
in
the
first
trimester
have
been
associated
with
orofacial
clefts
Mood
stabilisers
such
as
lithium
carbamazepine
and
valproic
acid
(sodium
valproate)
are
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
fetal
malformations
Both
benzodiazepines
and
lithium
may
cause
adaptation
problems
in
the
newborn
In
utero
exposure
to
novel
antipsychotics
has
not
been
associated
with
congenital
malformations
however
the
data
are
still
limited
The
knowledge
about
long-term
neurobehavioural
effects
in
the
offspring
is
still
limited
for
all
agents
and
requires
further
investigation
Possible
adverse
effects
of
fetal
exposure
must
be
balanced
against
the
adverse
effects
of
an
untreated
maternal
mood
disorder
