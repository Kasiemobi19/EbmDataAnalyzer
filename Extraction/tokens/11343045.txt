Montelukast
added

budesonide
in
children
with
persistent

a

crossover
study
Abstract
Text
We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
adding
montelukast
to
budesonide
would
improve
asthma
control
in
children
with
inhaled
glucocorticoid-dependent
persistent
asthma
In
a
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
crossover
study
we
compared
the
benefit
of
adding
montelukast
5
mg
or
placebo
once
daily
to
budesonide
200
microg
twice
daily
After
a
1-month
run-in
with
budesonide
200
microg
twice
daily
279
children
were
randomized
to
montelukast
or
placebo
The
mean
+/-
SD
age
was
104
+/-
22
years
the
mean
forced
expiratory
volume
in
1
second
(FEV(1))
was
777%
+/-
106%
predicted
and
reversibility
was
181%
+/-
129%
Compared
with
adding
placebo
to
budesonide
adding
montelukast
produced
significant
improvements
in
mean
percent
change
from
baseline
FEV(1)
(P
=062
[P
=010
for
per-protocol
analysis])
mean
absolute
change
from

FEV(1)
(P
=040)
mean
increase
from
baseline
in
morning
(P
=023)
and
evening
(P

peak
expiratory
flows
decrease
in
exacerbation
days
by
approximately
23%
(P
<001)
decreased
beta2-agonist
use
(P
=013)
and
reduced
blood
eosinophil
counts
(P
<001)
The
treatments
did
not
differ
significantly
with
regard
to
safety
Montelukast
5
mg
added
to
budesonide
improved
asthma
control
significantly
indicated
by
a
small
additive
effect
on
lung
function
and
a
clinically
relevant
decrease
in
asthma
exacerbation
days
