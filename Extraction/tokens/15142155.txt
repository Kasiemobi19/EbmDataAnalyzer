Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
use
of
a
topical
anaesthetic
mixture
to
improve
premature
ejaculation
(PE)
for
which
penile
hypersensitivity
might
be
a
cause
The
study
included
42
men
divided
in
two
groups
group
A
used
a
lidocaine-prilocaine
solution
and
group
B
used
an
inert
cream
The
tubes
of
cream
were
distributed
randomly
and
participants
asked
to
note
any
unpleasant
symptoms
difficulties
and
the
results
of
each
attempt
at
intercourse
assessed
by
the
intravaginal
ejaculatory
latency
time
(IELT)
There
was
a
significant
increase
in
the
mean
(sd)
IELT
from
149
(09)
to
845
(09)
min
(P
<
0001)
in
group
A
but
not
in
group
B
at
167
(07)
to
195
(012)
min
(P
>
005)
We
suggest
that
anaesthetic
cream
might
be
effective
for
treating
PE
