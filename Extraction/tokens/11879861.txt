Corticosteroid

physiotherapy
or
a
wait-and-see
policy
for
lateral
epicondylitis
a
randomised
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Lateral
epicondylitis
is
generally
treated
with
corticosteroid
injections
or
physiotherapy
Dutch
clinical
guidelines
recommend
a
wait-and-see
policy
We
compared
the
efficacy
of
these
approaches
Patients
with
lateral
epicondylitis
of
at
least
6
weeks'
duration
were
recruited
by
family
doctors
We
randomly
allocated
eligible
patients
to
6
weeks
of
treatment
with
corticosteroid
injections
physiotherapy
or
a
wait-and-see
policy
Outcome
measures
included
general
improvement
severity
of
the
main
complaint
pain
elbow
disability
and
patient
satisfaction
Severity
of
elbow
complaints
grip
strength
and
pressure
pain
threshold
were
assessed
by
a
research
physiotherapist
who
was
unaware
of
treatment
allocation
We
assessed
all
outcomes
at
3
6
12
26
and
52
weeks
The
principal
analysis
was
done
on
an
intention-to-treat
basis
We
randomly
assigned
185
patients
At
6
weeks
corticosteroid
injections
were
significantly
better
than
all
other
therapy
options
for
all
outcome
measures
Success
rates
were
92%
(57)
compared
with
47%
(30)
for
physiotherapy
and
32%
(19)
for
wait-and-see
policy
However
recurrence
rate
in
the
injection
group
was
high
Long-term
differences
between
injections
and
physiotherapy
were
significantly
in
favour
of
physiotherapy
Success
rates
at
52
weeks
were
69%
(43)
for
injections
91%
(58)
for
physiotherapy
and
83%
(49)
for
a
wait-and-see
policy
Physiotherapy
had
better
results
than
a
wait-and-see
policy
but
differences
were
not
significant
Patients
should
be
properly
informed
about
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
treatment
options
for
lateral
epicondylitis
The
decision
to
treat
with
physiotherapy
or
to
adopt
a
wait-and-see
policy
might
depend
on
available
resources
since
the
relative
gain
of
physiotherapy
is
small
