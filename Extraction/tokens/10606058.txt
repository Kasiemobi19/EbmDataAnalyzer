An
evidence-based
review
of
the
efficacy
of
antihistamines
in
relieving
pruritus
in
atopic
dermatitis
Abstract
Text
To
critically
review
the
body
of
clinical
trials
that
refute
or
support
the
efficacy
of
antihistamines
in
relieving
pruritus
in
patients
with
atopic
dermatitis
Review
of
MEDLINE
from
1966
through
March
1999
the
Cochrane
Database
of
Systematic
Reviews
and
Best
Evidence
to
identify
therapeutic
trials
of
antihistamines
in
patients
with
atopic
dermatitis
All
randomized
controlled
trials
or
clinical
trials
of
antihistamines
used
in
the
treatment
of
atopic
dermatitis
We
found
16
studies
throughout
the
literature
Large
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
clinical
trials
with
definitive
conclusions
(grade
A
trials)
have
not
been
performed
Two
grade
B
trials
(small
rigorous
randomized
trials
with
uncertain
results
due
to
moderate
to
high
alpha
or
beta
error)
refuted
the
use
of
antihistamines
in
relieving
pruritus
One
grade
B
trial
supported
the
efficacy
of
antihistamines
in
relieving
pruritus
All
remaining
trials
(grade
C)
lacked
placebo
controls
or
randomization
or
contained
fewer
than
20
patients
in
each
treatment
group
Although
antihistamines
are
often
used
in
the
treatment
of
atopic
dermatitis
little
objective
evidence
exists
to
demonstrate
relief
of
pruritus
The
majority
of
trials
are
flawed
in
terms
of
the
sample
size
or
study
design
Based
on
the
literature
alone
the
efficacy
of
antihistamines
remains
to
be
adequately
investigated
Anecdotally
sedating
antihistamines
have
sometimes
been
useful
by
virtue
of
their
soporific
effect
and
bedtime
use
may
be
warranted
There
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
effectiveness
of
expensive
nonsedating
agents
