Broad-spectrum
sunscreen
use
and
the
development
of
new
nevi
in
white
children
A
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
High
nevus
density
is
a
risk
factor
for
cutaneous
malignant
melanoma
Melanocytic
nevi
originate
in
childhood
and
are
largely
caused
by
solar
exposure
To
determine
whether
use
of
broad-spectrum
high-sun
protection
factor
(SPF)
sunscreen
attenuates
development
of
nevi
in
white
children
Randomized
trial
conducted
June
1993
to
May
1996
A
total
of
458
Vancouver
British
Columbia
schoolchildren
in
grades
1
and
4
were
randomized
in
1993
After
exclusion
of
nonwhite
children
and
those
lost
to
follow-up
or
with
missing
data
309
children
remained
for
analysis
Each
child's
nevi
were
enumerated
at
the
start
and
end
of
the
study
in
1996
Parents
of
children
randomly
assigned
to
the
treatment
group
(n=222)
received
a
supply
of
SPF
30
broad-spectrum
sunscreen
with
directions
to
apply
it
to
exposed
sites
when
the
child
was
expected
to
be
in
the
sun
for
30
minutes
or
more
Children
randomly
assigned
to
the
control
group
(n=236)
received
no
sunscreen
and
were
given
no
advice
about
sunscreen
use
Number
of
new
nevi
acquired
during
the
3
years
of
the
study
compared
between
treatment
and
control
groups
Children
in
the
sunscreen
group
developed
fewer
nevi
than
did
children
in
the
control
group
(median
counts
24
vs
28
P=048)
A
significant
interaction
was
detected
between
freckling
and
study
group
indicating
that
sunscreen
use
was
much
more
important
for
children
with
freckles
than
for
children
without
Modeling
of
the
data
suggests
that
freckled
children
assigned
to
a
broad-spectrum
sunscreen
intervention
would
develop
30%
to
40%
fewer
new
nevi
than
freckled
children
assigned
to
the
control
group
Our
data
indicate
that
broad-spectrum
sunscreens
may
attenuate
the
number
of
nevi
in
white
children
especially
if
they
have
freckles
