Influence
of
alcohol
intake
on
risk

increased
low-density

in

Japanese

Abstract
Text
Decreased
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
in
chronic
alcoholics
is
well
known
However
the
importance
of
light
to
moderate
alcohol
consumption
is
less
certain
We
investigated
the
association
of
alcohol
intake
with
risk
for
increased
LDL
cholesterol
over
5
years
in
a
cohort
of
933
Japanese
male
office
workers
aged
35
to
54
years
who
had
LDL
cholesterol
levels
less
than
140
mg/dl
and
were
not
taking
medication
for
dyslipidemia
hypertension
diabetes
liver
disease
or
hyperuricemia
at
study
entry
Incident-increased
LDL
cholesterol
was
defined
by
an
LDL
cholesterol
level
of
140
mg/dl
or
more
or
use
of
medication
for
dyslipidemia
Each
individual's
slope
for
LDL
cholesterol
was
also
calculated
with
a
simple
linear
regression
model
Three
hundred
twenty-one
men
developed
increased
LDL
cholesterol
during
3785
person-years
of
follow-up
After
controlling
for
potential
predictors
of
increased
LDL
cholesterol
the
relative
risk
for
increased
LDL
cholesterol
compared
with
nondrinkers
was
089
for
those
who
drank
01
to
229
g/day
of
ethanol
074
for
those
who
drank
230
to
459
g/day
of
ethanol
064
for
those
who
drank
460
to
599
g/day
of
ethanol
and
054
for
those
who
drank
690
g/day
or
more
of
ethanol
(p
<
0001)
Slopes
of
LDL
cholesterol
level
decreased
significantly
as
alcohol
intake
increased
From
multiple
linear
regression
analyses
alcohol
intake
remained
as
an
independent
negative
factor
for
slopes
of
LDL
cholesterol
level
Alcohol
intake
is
negatively
associated
with
development
of
increased
LDL
cholesterol
in
middle-aged
Japanese
men
