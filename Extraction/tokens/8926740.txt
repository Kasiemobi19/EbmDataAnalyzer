Drug
testing
in
the
workplace
could
a
positive
test
for
one
of
the
mandated
drugs
be

reasons
other
than
illicit
use
of
the
drug
Abstract
Text
This
manuscript
reviews
data
available
in
the
scientific
literature
relative
to
drug
testing
for
the
five
mandated
drug
classes
and
circumstances
other
than
abuse
of
the
drug
itself
that
could
result
in
a
positive
test
For
marijuana
passive
inhalation
unknowing
oral
ingestion
and
the
use
of
Marinol
are
discussed
Data
are
presented
on
the
concentration
of
delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
and
its
precursors
acid-A
and
acid-B
in
illicit
marijuana
and
the
extent
of
extraction
of
THC
in
boiled
(tea)
or
cooked
products
For
cocaine
passive
inhalation
and
passive
exposure
issues
are
reviewed
For
opiates
poppy
seed
ingestion
and
guidelines
for
exclusion
of
poppy
seeds
as
a
cause
for
a
positive
test
are
discussed
For
amphetamines
issues
such
as
the
presence
of
other
phenethylamines
l-methamphetamine
(Vicks'
inhalers)
and
other
prescription
drugs
are
discussed
Although
passive
inhalation
of
methamphetamine
and
phencyclidine
is
theoretically
possible
no
data
were
available
on
these
issues
