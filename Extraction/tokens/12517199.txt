Nebulizers
vs
metered-dose
inhalers
with
spacers
for
bronchodilator
therapy
to

wheezing

children

Abstract
Text
To
determine
if
administration
of
albuterol
by
a
metered-dose
inhaler
with
a
spacer
device
is
as
efficacious
as
administration
of
albuterol
by
nebulizer
to
treat
wheezing
in
children
aged
2
years
and
younger
Double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
clinical
trial
Pediatric
emergency
department
From
a
convenience
sample
of
wheezing
children
aged
2
to
24
months
85
patients
were
enrolled
in
the
nebulizer
group
and
83
in
the
spacer
group
The
nebulizer
group
received
a
placebo
metered-dose
inhaler
with
a
spacer
followed
by
nebulized
albuterol
The
spacer
group
received
albuterol
by
a
metered-dose
inhaler
with
a
spacer
followed
by
nebulized
isotonic
sodium
chloride
solution
Treatments
were
given
every
20
minutes
by
a
single
investigator
blinded
to
group
assignment
The
primary
outcome
was
admission
rate
Pulmonary
Index
score
and
oxygen
saturation
were
measured
initially
and
10
minutes
after
each
treatment
The
nebulizer
group
had
a
significantly
higher
mean
(SD)
initial
Pulmonary
Index
score
compared
with
the
spacer
group
(76
[25]
vs
66
[20]
P
=002)
With
the
initial
Pulmonary
Index
score
controlled
children
in
the
spacer
group
were
admitted
less
(5%
vs
20%
P
=05)
Analyses
also
revealed
an
interaction
between
group
and
initial
Pulmonary
Index
score
lower
admission
rates
in
the
spacer
group
were
found
primarily
in
children
having
a
more
severe
asthma
exacerbation
Our
data
suggest
that
metered-dose
inhalers
with
spacers
may
be
as
efficacious
as
nebulizers
for
the
emergency
department
treatment
of
wheezing
in
children
aged
2
years
or
younger
