Title
Radiologic
investigation
of
renal
colic
unenhanced
helical
CT
compared
with
excretory
urography
Abstract
Text
Our
aim
was
to
compare
unenhanced
helical
CT
and
excretory
urography
in
the
assessment
of
patients
with
renal
colic
Fifty-three
of
70
consecutive
patients
with
acute
signs
of
renal
colic
were
prospectively
examined
with
unenhanced
helical
CT
which
was
followed
immediately
by
excretory
urography
Two
radiologists
who
were
unaware
of
the
findings
independently
interpreted
these
examinations
to
determine
the
presence
or
absence
of
ureteral
obstruction
On
all
CT
scans
that
had
positive
findings
for
ureteral
stones
or
obstruction
we
looked
for
secondary
signs
of
obstruction
(perinephric
or
periureteral
fat
stranding
ureteral
wall
edema
ureteral
dilatation
and
blurring
of
renal
sinus
fat)
A
stone
was
recovered
in
45
of
the
53
patients
nine
before
and
36
after
imaging
The
latter
36
patients
had
their
stones
identified
on
CT
whereas
only
24
patients
had
their
stones
identified
on
excretory
urography
Eight
patients
without
stone
disease
had
normal
ureters
on
both
CT
and
excretory
urography
Of
the
45
patients
who
had
stone
disease
26
had
ureteral
dilatation
on
both
CT
and
excretory
urography
and
36
patients
who
recovered
a
stone
after
CT
had
secondary
signs
of
obstruction
Of
the
nine
patients
who
recovered
a
stone
before
CT
three
had
secondary
signs
of
obstruction
Two
patients
had
periureteral
fat
stranding
ureteral
wall
edema
and
renal
sinus
fat
blurring
One
patient
had
only
ureteral
wall
edema
Compared
with
excretory
urography
unenhanced
helical
CT
is
better
for
identifying
ureteral
stones
in
patients
with
acute
ureterolithiasis
Secondary
CT
signs
of
obstruction
including
renal
sinus
fat
blurring
were
frequently
present
even
when
the
stone
was
eliminated
before
imaging
