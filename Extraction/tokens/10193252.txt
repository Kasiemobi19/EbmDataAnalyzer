Title
Randomised
controlled
trial
of
aminophylline
for
severe
acute
asthma
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
children
with
severe
acute
asthma
treated
with
large
doses
of
inhaled
salbutamol
inhaled
ipratropium
and
intravenous
steroids
are
conferred
any
further
benefits
by
the
addition
of
aminophylline
given
intravenously
Randomised
double
blind
placebo
controlled
trial
of
163
children
admitted
to
hospital
with
asthma
who
were
unresponsive
to
nebulised
salbutamol
The
placebo
and
treatment
groups
of
children
were
similar
at
baseline
The
48
children
in
the
aminophylline
group
had
a
greater
improvement
in
spirometry
at
six
hours
and
a
higher
oxygen
saturation
in
the
first
30
hours
Five
subjects
in
the
placebo
group
were
intubated
and
ventilated
after
enrollment
compared
with
none
in
the
aminophylline
group
Aminophylline
continues
to
have
a
place
in
the
management
of
severe
acute
asthma
in
children
unresponsive
to
initial
treatment
