Title
Differentiation
of
idiopathic
toe-walking
and
cerebral
palsy
Abstract
Text
Kinematic
data
were
collected
on
two
groups
of
children
with
diagnoses
of
idiopathic
toe-walking
and
mild
spastic
diplegia
Although
both
groups
lacked
a
heel
strike
at
initial
contact
two
distinct
gait
patterns
were
found
The
toe-walkers
displayed
a
variable
pattern
of
ankle
motion
with
moderate
to
severe
plantarflexion
at
stance
The
cerebral
palsy
patients
showed
a
repeatable
gait
pattern
with
only
minimal
deviation
from
normal
The
absence
of
a
heel
strike
in
this
group
is
due
to
the
sustained
knee
flexion
at
terminal
swing
and
initial
contact
which
was
significantly
greater
than
in
the
toe-walkers
