Abductor
sign
a
reliable
new
sign
to
detect
unilateral
non-organic
paresis
of
the
lower
limb
Abstract
Text
To
test
a
new
neurological
sign
the
"abductor
sign"
which
can
distinguish
between
organic
and
non-organic
leg
paresis
using
synergic
movements
of
the
bilateral
hip
abductors
The
subjects
were
33
patients
presenting
with
paresis
of
one
leg
17
of
organic
origin
and
16
of
non-organic
origin
(hysteria)
To
test
the
abductor
sign
the
examiner
told
the
patient
to
abduct
each
leg
and
opposed
this
movement
with
his
hands
placed
on
the
lateral
surfaces
of
the
patient's
legs
The
leg
contralateral
to
the
abducted
one
showed
opposite
actions
for
organic
paresis
and
non-organic
paresis
for
example
when
the
paretic
leg
was
abducted
the
sound
leg
stayed
fixed
in
organic
paresis
but
moved
in
the
hyperadducting
direction
in
non-organic
paresis
Hoover's
sign
was
used
for
comparison
in
the
same
patients
The
abductor
sign
gave
the
correct
classification
for
all
33
cases
Hoover's
sign
was
reliable
if
the
results
were
carefully
interpreted
but
it
was
non-diagnostic
for
16
patients
because
of
strong
hip
extensors
and
in
two
because
of
strong
hip
flexors
Two
patients
with
non-organic
paresis
succeeded
in
tricking
the
examiner
by
pretending
full
effort
to
lift
the
paretic
leg
The
abductor
sign
is
a
useful
test
to
detect
non-organic
paresis
because
(1)
it
is
difficult
for
a
hysterical
patient
to
deceive
the
examiner
(2)
the
hip
abductor
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
involved
muscles
in
pyramidal
weakness
and
(3)
the
results
are
easily
visible
as
movement
or
non-movement
of
the
unabducted
leg
