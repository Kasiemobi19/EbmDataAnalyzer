meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
efficacy
of
intra-articular
corticosteroid
injections
for
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee

to
identify

to
treat

Randomised
controlled
trial
in
which
the
efficacy
of
intra-articular
corticosteroid
injections
for
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
could
be
ascertained
In
high
quality
studies
the
pooled
relative
risk
for
improvement
in
symptoms
of
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
at
16-24
weeks
after
intra-articular
corticosteroid
injections
was
209
(95%
confidence
interval
12
to
37)
and
the
number
needed
to
treat
was
44
The
pooled
relative
risk
for
improvement
up
to
two
weeks
after
injections
was
166
(137
to
20)
The
numbers
needed
to
treat
to
get
one
improvement
in
the
statistically
significant
studies
was
13
to
35
patients
Evidence
supports
short
term
(up
to
two
weeks)
improvement
in
symptoms
of
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
after
intra-articular
corticosteroid
injection
Significant
improvement
was
also
shown
in
the
only
methodologically
sound
studies
addressing
longer
term
response
(16-24
weeks)
A
dose
equivalent
to
50
mg
of
prednisone
may
be
needed
to
show
benefit
at
16-24
weeks
