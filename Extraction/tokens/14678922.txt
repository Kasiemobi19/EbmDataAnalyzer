Title
Management
of
atrial
fibrillation
review
of
the
evidence
for
the
role
of
pharmacologic
therapy
electrical
cardioversion
and
echocardiography
Abstract
Text
This
review
summarizes
the
available
evidence
regarding
the
efficacy
of
medications
used
for
ventricular
rate
control
stroke
prevention
acute
conversion
and
maintenance
of
sinus
rhythm
as
well
as
the
efficacy
of
electrical
cardioversion
and
the
use
of
echocardiography
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
The
Cochrane
Collaboration's
database
of
controlled
clinical
trials
and
MEDLINE
Primarily
randomized
controlled
trials
of
medications
Paired
reviewers
obtained
data
on
efficacy
and
safety
Strength
of
evidence
was
assessed
Recent
clinical
trial
results
showed
that
most
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
have
similar
outcomes
with
strategies
for
controlling
ventricular
rate
compared
with
strategies
for
restoring
sinus
rhythm
For
efficacy
of
primary
stroke
prevention
compared
with
placebo
evidence
was
strong
for
warfarin
and
suggestive
for
aspirin
The
evidence
for
an
increased
risk
for
major
bleeding
was
suggestive
for
warfarin
and
inconclusive
for
aspirin
For
ventricular
rate
control
verapamil
diltiazem
atenolol
and
metoprolol
were
qualitatively
superior
to
digoxin
and
placebo
particularly
during
exercise
For
efficacy
of
acute
conversion
compared
with
placebo
evidence
was
strong
for
ibutilide
flecainide
dofetilide
propafenone
amiodarone
and
quinidine
For
efficacy
of
maintenance
of
sinus
rhythm
after
conversion
from
atrial
fibrillation
evidence
was
strong
for
amiodarone
propafenone
disopyramide
and
sotalol
Echocardiography
was
found
to
be
useful
in
estimating
risk
for
thromboembolism
and
potentially
useful
in
estimating
likelihood
of
successful
cardioversion
and
maintenance
For
several
key
questions
in
the
pharmacologic
management
of
atrial
fibrillation
strong
evidence
exists
to
support
1
or
more
treatment
options
