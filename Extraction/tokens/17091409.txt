Prevention
of
postpartum

uterotonic
agents
comparison
of
oxytocin
and
methylergometrine
in
the
management
of
the
third
stage

Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
efficacy
of
intravenous
oxytocin
administration
compared
with
intravenous
methylergometrine
administration
for
the
prevention
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
(PPH)
and
the
significance
of
administration
at
the
end
of
the
second
stage
of
labor
compared
with
that
after
the
third
stage
A
prospective
study
was
undertaken
two
major
groups
(oxytocin
group
and
methylergometrine
group)
of
438
women
with
singleton
pregnancy
and
vaginal
delivery
were
studied
during
a
15-month
period
These
two
groups
were
subdivided
into
three
subgroups
1
intravenous
injection
(two
minutes)
group
immediately
after
the
delivery
of
the
fetal
anterior
shoulder
2
intravenous
injection
(two
minutes)
group
immediately
after
the
delivery
of
the
placenta
and
3
drip
infusion
(20
min)
group
immediately
after
the
delivery
of
the
fetal
head
In
each
group
quantitative
postpartum
blood
loss
frequencies
of
blood
loss
>500
ml
and
need
of
additional
uterotonic
treatment
were
evaluated
As
compared
with
methylergometrine
oxytocin
administration
was
associated
with
a
significant
reduction
in
postpartum
blood
loss
and
in
frequency
of
blood
loss
>500
ml
The
risk
of
PPH
was
significantly
reduced
with
intravenous
injection
of
oxytocin
after
delivery
of
the
fetal
anterior
shoulder
compared
with
intravenous
injection
of
oxytocin
after
expulsion
of
the
placenta
(OR
033
95%CI
011-098)
and
intravenous
injection
of
methylergometrine
after
delivery
of
the
fetal
anterior
shoulder
(OR
031
95%CI
011-085)
Intravenous
injection
of
5
IU
oxytocin
immediately
after
delivery
of
fetal
anterior
shoulder
is
the
treatment
of
choice
for
prevention
of
PPH
in
patients
with
natural
course
of
labor
