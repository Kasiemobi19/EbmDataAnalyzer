Zinc
supplementation
in
infants
born
small
for
gestational
age
reduces
mortality
a
prospective
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Low
birth
weight
infants
have
been
noted
to
have
low
zinc
concentrations
in
cord
blood
and
zinc
deficiency
in
childhood
is
associated
with
reduced
immunocompetence
and
increased
infectious
disease
morbidity
This
study
investigates
whether
zinc
supplementation
of
infants
born
full
term
and
small
for
gestational
age
affects
mortality
A
randomized
double-blind
controlled
trial
with
2-by-2
factorial
design
enrolled
1154
full-term
small
for
gestational
age
infants
to
receive
in
syrup
1
of
the
following
riboflavin
riboflavin
and
zinc
(5
mg
as
sulfate)
riboflavin
calcium
phosphorus
folate
and
iron
or
riboflavin
zinc
calcium
phosphorus
folate
and
iron
A
fixed
dosage
of
5
mL
per
child
was
given
daily
from
30
to
284
days
of
age
Household
visits
were
made
6
days
per
week
to
provide
the
syrup
and
conduct
surveillance
for
illness
and
death
When
a
child's
death
was
reported
parental
reports
and
medical
records
were
used
to
ascertain
the
cause
The
effects
of
zinc
and
of
the
combination
of
iron
folate
calcium
and
phosphorus
were
analyzed
by
intent
to
treat
The
mortality
analysis
was
performed
using
a
survival
analytic
approach
that
models
time
until
death
as
the
dependent
variable
all
models
had
2
terms
as
independent
variables
1
for
the
zinc
effect
and
1
for
the
vitamin
and
mineral
(calcium
and
phosphorus
folate
and
iron)
effect
Zinc
supplementation
was
associated
with
significantly
lower
mortality
with
a
rate
ratio
of
032
(95%
confidence
interval
012-089)
Calcium
phosphorus
folate
and
iron
supplementation
was
not
associated
with
a
mortality
reduction
although
a
statistically
nonsignificant
trend
toward
reduction
was
observed
with
a
rate
ratio
of
088
(95%
confidence
interval
036-215)
Zinc
supplementation
in
small
for
gestational
age
infants
can
result
in
a
substantial
reduction
in
infectious
disease
mortality
