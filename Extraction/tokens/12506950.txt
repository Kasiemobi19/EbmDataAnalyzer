Abstract
Text
Oral
thrush
is
a
common
condition
in
young
infants
Nystatin
treatment
is
associated
with
frequent
recurrences
and
difficulty
in
administration
Fluconazole
was
compared
with
nystatin
for
the
treatment
of
oral
candidiasis
in
infants
Thirty-four
infants
were
randomized
to
either
nystatin
oral
suspension
four
times
a
day
for
10
days
or
fluconazole
suspension
3
mg/kg
in
a
single
daily
dose
for
7
days
Clinical
cures
for
nystatin
were
6
of
19
(32%)
and
those
for
fluconazole
were
15
of
15
(100%)

In
this
small
pilot
study
fluconazole
was
shown
to
be
superior
to
nystatin
suspension
for
the
treatment
of
oral
thrush
in
otherwise
healthy
infants
