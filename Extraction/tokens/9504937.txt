Title
Hypovitaminosis
D
in
medical
inpatients
Abstract
Text
Vitamin
D
deficiency
is
a
major
risk
factor
for
bone
loss
and
fracture
Although
hypovitaminosis
D
has
been
detected
frequently
in
elderly
and
housebound
people
the
prevalence
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
among
patients
hospitalized
on
a
general
medical
service
is
unknown
We
assessed
vitamin
D
intake
ultraviolet-light
exposure
and
risk
factors
for
hypovitaminosis
D
and
measured
serum
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
parathyroid
hormone
and
ionized
calcium
in
290
consecutive
patients
on
a
general
medical
ward
A
total
of
164
patients
(57
percent)
were
considered
vitamin
D-deficient
(serum
concentration
of
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
<
or
=
15
ng
per
milliliter)
of
whom
65
(22
percent)
were
considered
severely
vitamin
D-deficient
(serum
concentration
of
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
<8
ng
per
milliliter)
Serum
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
concentrations
were
related
inversely
to
parathyroid
hormone
concentrations
Lower
vitamin
D
intake
less
exposure
to
ultraviolet
light
anticonvulsant-drug
therapy
renal
dialysis
nephrotic
syndrome
hypertension
diabetes
mellitus
winter
season
higher
serum
concentrations
of
parathyroid
hormone
and
alkaline
phosphatase
and
lower
serum
concentrations
of
ionized
calcium
and
albumin
were
significant
univariate
predictors
of
hypovitaminosis
D
Sixty-nine
percent
of
the
patients
who
consumed
less
than
the
recommended
daily
allowance
of
vitamin
D
and
43
percent
of
the
patients
with
vitamin
D
intakes
above
the
recommended
daily
allowance
were
vitamin
D-deficient
Inadequate
vitamin
D
intake
winter
season
and
housebound
status
were
independent
predictors
of
hypovitaminosis
D
in
a
multivariate
model
In
a
subgroup
of
77
patients
less
than
65
years
of
age
without
known
risk
factors
for
hypovitaminosis
D
the
prevalence
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
was
42
percent
Hypovitaminosis
D
is
common
in
general
medical
inpatients
including
those
with
vitamin
D
intakes
exceeding
the
recommended
daily
allowance
and
those
without
apparent
risk
factors
for
vitamin
D
deficiency
