A
double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
trial
of
augmentation
with
lamotrigine
or
placebo
in
patients
concomitantly
treated
with
fluoxetine
for
resistant

Abstract
Text
Evidence
of
the
antidepressant
efficacy
of
lamotrigine
is
increasing
although
there
are
no
placebo-controlled
trials
of
lamotrigine
augmentation
in
depression
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
if
augmentation
with
lamotrigine
was
superior
to
placebo
in
patients
who
were
receiving
fluoxetine
for
resistant
major
depressive
episodes
Twenty-three
patients
who
had
experienced
at
least
1
major
depressive
episode
that
was
resistant
to
at
least
1
prior
trial
of
antidepressant
therapy
were
selected
These
patients
were
treated
with
fluoxetine
20
mg/day
and
concomitantly
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
lamotrigine
(N
=
13)
or
placebo
(N
=
10)
for
6
weeks
The
dose
of
lamotrigine
was
titrated
upward
from
25
mg/day
to
100
mg/day
Patients
suffering
from
bipolar
II
disorder
(N
=
8)
or
from
major
depressive
disorder
(N
=
15)
(DSM-IV
criteria)
were
enrolled
resulting
in
heterogeneity
of
the
sample
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
Hamilton
Rating
Scale
for
Depression
score
Data
were
collected
from
2000-2001
Lamotrigine
was
statistically
superior
to
placebo
on
the
Clinical
Global
Impressions
scale
at
endpoint
both
in
absolute
terms
(mean
+/-
SD
Clinical
Global
Impressions-Severity
of
Illness
scores
lamotrigine
215
+/-
128
placebo
340
+/-

p

and
using
a
responder
analysis
with
response
defined
as
a
Clinical
Global
Impressions-Improvement
score
of
2
or
less
(lamotrigine
8462%
[N
=
11]
placebo
3000%
[N
=
3]
p
=013)
The
effect
of
lamotrigine
on
Clinical
Global
Impressions
scale
scores
was
seen
in
both
major
depressive
disorder
and
bipolar
II
disorder
Lamotrigine
however
failed
to
separate
statistically
from
placebo
on
the
Hamilton
Rating
Scale
for
Depression
and
Montgomery-Asberg
Depression
Rating
Scale
This
failure
to
differentiate
on
a
primary
outcome
measure
is
essentially
a
negative
study
result
This
result
is
most
likely
an
artifact
of
the
small
sample
size
used
and
the
resultant
limited
power
of
the
study
The
results
of
this
trial
add
to
the
literature
suggesting
potential
efficacy
of
the
antidepressant
profile
of
lamotrigine
In
addition
this
study
points
to
a
possible
role
of
lamotrigine
as
an
augmentation
agent
in
depression
