Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
effects
of
amitriptyline
and
sudden
analgesic
withdrawal
on
headache
frequency
and
quality
of
life
in
patients
suffering
from
chronic
daily
headache
related
to
analgesics
abuse
Seventeen
nondepressed
patients
with
chronic
drug-induced
headache
were
included
in
a
9-week
parallel-group
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
After
abrupt
analgesic
withdrawal
amitriptyline
or
an
active
placebo
(trihexyphenidyl)
was
started
The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
headache
frequency
recorded
on
a
headache
diary
in
the
last
4
weeks
of
each
treatment
The
secondary
efficacy
variable
was
quality
of
life
(Nottingham
Health
Profile)
Headache
frequency
decreased
by
45%
in
the
amitriptyline
group
and
by
28%
in
the
trihexyphenidyl
group
Amitriptyline
enhanced
all
the
dimensions
of
quality
of
life
and
significantly
improved
emotional
reaction
and
social
isolation
This
pilot
study
suggests
a
beneficial
effect
of
amitriptyline
on
headache
frequency
and
quality
of
life
for
patients
with
chronic
drug-induced
headache
