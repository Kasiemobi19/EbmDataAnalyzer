The

of
spinal

amitriptyline
and
the
combination

migraine

Abstract
Text
Migraine
headache
affects
approximately
11
million
adults
in
the
United
States
Spinal
manipulation
is
a
common
alternative
therapy
for
headaches
but
its
efficacy
compared
with
standard
medical
therapies
is
unknown
To
measure
the
relative
efficacy
of
amitriptyline
spinal
manipulation
and
the
combination
of
both
therapies
for
the
prophylaxis
of
migraine
headache
A
prospective
randomized
parallel-group
comparison
After
a
4-wk
baseline
period
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
8
wk
of
treatment
after
which
there
was
a
4-wk
follow-up
period
Chiropractic
college
outpatient
clinic
A
total
of
218
patients
with
the
diagnosis
of
migraine
headache
An
8-wk
course
of
therapy
with
spinal
manipulation
amitriptyline
or
a
combination
of
the
two
treatments
A
headache
index
score
derived
from
a
daily
headache
pain
diary
during
the
last
4
wk
of
treatment
and
during
the
4-wk
follow-up
period
Clinically
important
improvement
was
observed
in
both
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
in
all
three
study
groups
over
time
The
reduction
in
headache
index
scores
during
treatment
compared
with
baseline
was
49%
for
amitriptyline
40%
for
spinal
manipulation
and
41%
for
the
combined
group
p
=
66
During
the
posttreatment
follow-up
period
the
reduction
from
baseline
was
24%
for
amitriptyline
42%
for
spinal
manipulation
and
25%
for
the
combined
group
p
=
05
There
was
no
advantage
to
combining
amitriptyline
and
spinal
manipulation
for
the
treatment
of
migraine
headache
Spinal
manipulation
seemed
to
be
as
effective
as
a
well-established
and
efficacious
treatment
(amitriptyline)
and
on
the
basis
of
a
benign
side
effects
profile
it
should
be
considered
a
treatment
option
for
patients
with
frequent
migraine
headaches
