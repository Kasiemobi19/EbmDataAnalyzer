Risk
of
perinatal
death
associated
with
labor
after
previous
cesarean
delivery
in
uncomplicated
term
pregnancies
Abstract
Text
Trial
of
labor
after
previous
cesarean
delivery
is
associated
with
increased
risk
of
uterine
rupture
However
no
reliable
data
exist
on
the
effect
of
a
trial
of
labor
on
the
risk
of
perinatal
death
in
otherwise
uncomplicated
term
pregnancies
To
determine
the
risk
of
intrapartum
stillbirth
or
neonatal
death
not
related
to
congenital
abnormality
among
women
with
uncomplicated
term
pregnancies
who
had
a
trial
of
labor
after
previous
cesarean
delivery
compared
with
women
having
a
planned
repeat
cesarean
delivery
and
multiparous
and
nulliparous
women
at
term
not
delivered
by
planned
cesarean
method
Population-based
retrospective
cohort
study
of
data
from
the
linked
Scottish
Morbidity
Record
and
Stillbirth
and
Neonatal
Death
Enquiry
encompassing
births
in
Scotland
between
January
1
1992
and
December
31
1997
A
total
of
313
238
singleton
births
between
37
and
43
weeks'
gestational
age
in
which
the
fetus
was
in
a
cephalic
presentation
Delivery-related
perinatal
death
defined
as
intrapartum
stillbirth
or
neonatal
death
unrelated
to
congenital
anomaly
compared
among
the
4
groups
Among
women
who
had
a
trial
of
labor
following
previous
cesarean
delivery
(n
=
15
515)
the
overall
rate
of
delivery-related
perinatal
death
was
129
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
79-199)
per
10
000
women
This
was
approximately
11
times
greater
(odds
ratio
[OR]
116
95%
CI
16-867)
than
the
risk
associated
with
planned
repeat
cesarean
delivery
(n
=
9014)
more
than
twice
(OR
22
95%
CI
13-35)
the
risk
associated
with
other
multiparous
women
in
labor
(n
=
151
549)
and
similar
to
the
risk
among
nulliparous
women
in
labor
(n
=
137
160
OR
13
95%
CI
08-21)
The
associations
were
not
explained
by
differences
in
maternal
height
smoking
status
socioeconomic
status
age
fetal
growth
or
week
of
gestation
at
delivery
Among
women
having
a
trial
of
labor
the
rate
of
death
due
to
mechanical
causes
including
uterine
rupture
was
45
(95%
CI
18-93)
per
10
000
women
This
was
more
than
8
times
greater
than
other
multiparous
women
(OR
85
95%
CI
32-223)
and
nulliparous
women
(OR
88
95%
CI
32-242)
The
absolute
risk
of
perinatal
death
associated
with
trial
of
labor
following
previous
cesarean
delivery
is
low
However
in
our
study
the
risk
was
significantly
higher
than
that
associated
with
planned
repeat
cesarean
delivery
and
there
was
a
marked
excess
of
deaths
due
to
uterine
rupture
compared
with
other
women
in
labor
