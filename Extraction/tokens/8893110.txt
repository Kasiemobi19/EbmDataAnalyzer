Cetirizine
versus
hydroxyzine
and
placebo
in
chronic
idiopathic
urticaria
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
cetirizine
with
that
of
hydroxyzine
and
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
idiopathic
urticaria
A
4-week
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
double-dummy
placebo-controlled
safety
and
efficacy
study
Patients
were
treated
in
a
variety
of
allergy
practice
settings
The
study
population
consisted
of
188
patients
who
were
at
least
12
years
of
age
with
symptomatic
chronic
idiopathic
urticaria
that
had
occurred
episodically
for
at
least
6
weeks
Patients
were
given
either
cetirizine
10
mg
once
daily
hydroxyzine
25
mg
tid
or
placebo
for
4
weeks
Patients
and
investigators
used
a
4-point
scale
to
evaluate
symptoms
of
urticaria
and
adverse
effects
of
treatment
Ratings
were
compared
among
those
taking
cetirizine
hydroxyzine
or
placebo
After
1
day
of
treatment
patients
randomized
to
receive
cetirizine
10
mg/d
exhibited
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
episodes
of
urticaria
(and
a
reduction
in
pruritus)
compared
with
patients
who
received
hydroxyzine
25
mg
tid
and
patients
who
received
placebo
(p
=
0002)
The
number
of
urticarial
episodes
in
patients
treated
with
hydroxyzine
did
not
reach
significance
until
day
2
(p
=
0001)
Compared
with
patients
who
received
placebo
patients
who
received
cetirizine
and
those
who
received
hydroxyzine
showed
reductions
during
weeks
1
2
and
3
and
at
end-point
analysis
in
the
number
and
size
of
lesions
and
in
the
severity
of
pruritus
(p
<
004)
Patient
and
physician
evaluations
at
the
end
of
week
4
revealed
an
improvement
in
urticarial
symptoms
for
the
hydroxyzine
and
cetirizine
groups
compared
with
the
placebo
group
(p
<
0001)
Four
patients
in
the
hydroxyzine
group
1
patient
in
the
cetirizine
group
and
1
patient
in
the
placebo
group
discontinued
the
study
because
of
sedation
No
patient
withdrew
because
of
lack
of
efficacy
Cetirizine
10
mg
once
daily
was
equivalent
to
hydroxyzine
25
mg
tid
in
controlling
the
symptoms
of
patients
with
chronic
urticaria
as
assessed
by
patient
and
investigator
evaluations
