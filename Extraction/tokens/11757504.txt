Simvastatin
and
niacin
antioxidant
vitamins
or
the
combination
for
the
prevention
of
coronary
disease
Abstract
Text
Both
lipid-modifying
therapy
and
antioxidant
vitamins
are
thought
to
have
benefit
in
patients
with
coronary
disease
We
studied
simvastatin-niacin
and
antioxidant-vitamin
therapy
alone
and
together
for
cardiovascular
protection
in
patients
with
coronary
disease
and
low
plasma
levels
of
HDL
In
a
three-year
double-blind
trial
160
patients
with
coronary
disease
low
HDL
cholesterol
levels
and
normal
LDL
cholesterol
levels
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
one
of
four
regimens
simvastatin
plus
niacin
vitamins
simvastatin-niacin
plus
antioxidants
or
placebos
The
end
points
were
arteriographic
evidence
of
a
change
in
coronary
stenosis
and
the
occurrence
of
a
first
cardiovascular
event
(death
myocardial
infarction
stroke
or
revascularization)
The
mean
levels
of
LDL
and
HDL
cholesterol
were
unaltered
in
the
antioxidant
group
and
the
placebo
group
these
levels
changed
substantially
(by
-42
percent
and
+26
percent
respectively)
in
the
simvastatin-niacin
group
The
protective
increase
in
HDL2
with
simvastatin
plus
niacin
was
attenuated
by
concurrent
therapy
with
antioxidants
The
average
stenosis
progressed
by
39
percent
with
placebos
18
percent
with
antioxidants
(P=016
for
the
comparison
with
the
placebo
group)
and
07
percent
with
simvastatin-niacin
plus
antioxidants
(P=0004)
and
regressed
by
04
percent
with
simvastatin-niacin
alone
(P<0001)
The
frequency
of
the
clinical
end
point
was
24
percent
with
placebos
3
percent
with
simvastatin-niacin
alone
21
percent
in
the
antioxidant-therapy
group
and
14
percent
in
the
simvastatin-niacin-plus-antioxidants
group
Simvastatin
plus
niacin
provides
marked
clinical
and
angiographically
measurable
benefits
in
patients
with
coronary
disease
and
low
HDL
levels
The
use
of
antioxidant
vitamins
in
this
setting
must
be
questioned
