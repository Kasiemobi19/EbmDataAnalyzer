A
meta-analysis
of
short
versus
long
therapy
with
a
proton
pump
inhibitor
clarithromycin
and
either
metronidazole
or
amoxycillin
for
treating
Helicobacter
pylori
infection
Abstract
Text
Although
triple
therapies
with
a
proton
pump
inhibitor
clarithromycin
and
either
amoxycillin
or
metronidazole
are
the
most
widely
accepted
treatment
for
Helicobacter
pylori
infection
there
is
no
consensus
on
how
long
treatment
should
be
maintained
for
To
evaluate
whether
increasing
the
length
of
triple
therapies
beyond
7
days
improves
treatment
efficacy
An
extensive
search
of
the
literature
was
performed
Reports
of
randomized
trials
comparing
different
lengths
of
therapy
were
selected
Short
(7-day)
vs
long
(10/14-day)
therapies
were
compared
and
three-way
comparison
of
7-day
vs
10-day
10-day
vs
14-day
and
7-day
vs
14-day
therapies
was
performed
Meta-analysis
was
conducted
using
conventional
shareware
(Review

The
Peto
Odds
Ratio
using
a
fixed
model
analysis
was
calculated
for
each
comparison
Thirteen
studies
were
identified
Pooled
10-
to
14-day
therapies
achieved
better
results
than
7-day
schedules
In
head-to-head
comparisons
only
14-day
therapies
were
significantly
better
than
7-day
treatments
Improvement
in
cure
rates
ranged
from
7
to
9%
Comparisons
of
7-day
vs
10-day
and
10-day
vs
14-day
also
showed
a
non-significant
trend
towards
better
cure
rates
with
longer
therapies
Fourteen-day
proton
pump
inhibitor-based
triple
therapy
achieves
better
results
than
7-day
schedules
Additional
data
are
necessary
to
evaluate
10-day
therapies
