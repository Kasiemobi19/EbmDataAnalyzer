high-risk

angiotensin-converting

Abstract
Text
Antihypertensive
therapy
is
well
established
to
reduce
hypertension-related
morbidity
and
mortality
but
the
optimal
first-step
therapy
is
unknown
To
determine
whether
treatment
with
a
calcium
channel
blocker
or
an
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
lowers
the
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
or
other
cardiovascular
disease
(CVD)
events
vs
treatment
with
a
diuretic
The
Antihypertensive
and
Lipid-Lowering
Treatment
to
Prevent
Heart
Attack
Trial
(ALLHAT)
a
randomized
double-blind
active-controlled
clinical
trial
conducted
from
February
1994
through
March
2002
A
total
of
33
357
participants
aged
55
years
or
older
with
hypertension
and
at
least
1
other
CHD
risk
factor
from
623
North
American
centers
Participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
chlorthalidone
125
to
25
mg/d
(n
=
15
255)
amlodipine
25
to
10
mg/d
(n
=
9048)
or
lisinopril
10
to
40
mg/d
(n
=
9054)
for
planned
follow-up
of
approximately
4
to
8
years
The
primary
outcome
was
combined
fatal
CHD
or
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
analyzed
by
intent-to-treat
Secondary
outcomes
were
all-cause
mortality
stroke
combined
CHD
(primary
outcome
coronary
revascularization
or
angina
with
hospitalization)
and
combined
CVD
(combined
CHD
stroke
treated
angina
without
hospitalization
heart
failure
[HF]
and
peripheral
arterial
disease)
Mean
follow-up
was
49
years
The
primary
outcome
occurred
in
2956
participants
with
no
difference
between
treatments
Compared
with
chlorthalidone
(6-year
rate
115%)
the
relative
risks
(RRs)
were
098
(95%
CI
090-107)
for
amlodipine
(6-year
rate
113%)
and
099
(95%
CI
091-108)
for
lisinopril
(6-year
rate
114%)
Likewise
all-cause
mortality
did
not
differ
between
groups
Five-year
systolic
blood
pressures
were
significantly
higher
in
the
amlodipine
(08
mm
Hg
P
=03)
and
lisinopril
(2
mm
Hg
P<001)
groups
compared
with
chlorthalidone
and
5-year
diastolic
blood
pressure
was
significantly
lower
with
amlodipine
(08
mm
Hg
P<001)
For
amlodipine
vs
chlorthalidone
secondary
outcomes
were
similar
except
for
a
higher
6-year
rate
of
HF
with
amlodipine
(102%
vs
77%
RR
138
95%
CI
125-152)
For
lisinopril
vs
chlorthalidone
lisinopril
had
higher
6-year
rates
of
combined
CVD
(333%
vs
309%
RR
110
95%
CI
105-116)
stroke
(63%
vs
56%
RR
115
95%
CI
102-130)
and
HF
(87%
vs
77%
RR
119
95%
CI
107-131)
Thiazide-type
diuretics
are
superior
in
preventing
1
or
more
major
forms
of
CVD
and
are
less
expensive
They
should
be
preferred
for
first-step
antihypertensive
therapy
