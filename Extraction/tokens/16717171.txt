A
brief
measure
for
assessing
generalized
anxiety
disorder
the
GAD-7
Abstract
Text
Generalized
anxiety
disorder
(GAD)
is
one
of
the
most
common
mental
disorders
however
there
is
no
brief
clinical
measure
for
assessing
GAD
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
develop
a
brief
self-report
scale
to
identify
probable
cases
of
GAD
and
evaluate
its
reliability
and
validity
A
criterion-standard
study
was
performed
in
15
primary
care
clinics
in
the
United
States
from
November
2004
through
June
2005
Of
a
total
of
2740
adult
patients
completing
a
study
questionnaire
965
patients
had
a
telephone
interview
with
a
mental
health
professional
within
1
week
For
criterion
and
construct
validity
GAD
self-report
scale
diagnoses
were
compared
with
independent
diagnoses
made
by
mental
health
professionals
functional
status
measures
disability
days
and
health
care
use
A
7-item
anxiety
scale
(GAD-7)
had
good
reliability
as
well
as
criterion
construct
factorial
and
procedural
validity
A
cut
point
was
identified
that
optimized
sensitivity
(89%)
and
specificity
(82%)
Increasing
scores
on
the
scale
were
strongly
associated
with
multiple
domains
of
functional
impairment
(all

scales
and

days)
Although
GAD
and
depression
symptoms
frequently
co-occurred
factor
analysis
confirmed
them
as
distinct
dimensions
Moreover
GAD
and
depression
symptoms
had
differing
but
independent
effects
on
functional
impairment
and
disability
There
was
good
agreement
between
self-report
and
interviewer-administered
versions
of
the
scale
The
GAD-7
is
a
valid
and
efficient
tool
for
screening
for
GAD
and
assessing
its
severity
in
clinical
practice
and
research
