Cholesterol
and
all-cause
mortality
in
elderly
people
from
the
Honolulu
Heart
Program
a
cohort
study
Abstract
Text
A
generally
held
belief
is
that
cholesterol
concentrations
should
be
kept
low
to
lessen
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
However
studies
of
the
relation
between
serum
cholesterol
and
all-cause
mortality
in
elderly
people
have
shown
contrasting
results
To
investigate
these
discrepancies
we
did
a
longitudinal
assessment
of
changes
in
both
lipid
and
serum
cholesterol
concentrations
over
20
years
and
compared
them
with
mortality
Lipid
and
serum
cholesterol
concentrations
were
measured
in
3572
Japanese/American
men
(aged
71-93
years)
as
part
of
the
Honolulu
Heart
Program
We
compared
changes
in
these
concentrations
over
20
years
with
all-cause
mortality
using
three
different
Cox
proportional
hazards
models
Mean
cholesterol
fell
significantly
with
increasing
age
Age-adjusted
mortality
rates
were
683
489
411
and
433
for
the
first
to
fourth
quartiles
of
cholesterol
concentrations
respectively
Relative
risks
for
mortality
were
072
(95%
CI
060-087)
060
(049-074)
and
065
(053-080)
in
the
second
third
and
fourth
quartiles
respectively
with
quartile
1
as
reference
A
Cox
proportional
hazard
model
assessed
changes
in
cholesterol
concentrations
between
examinations
three
and
four
Only
the
group
with
low
cholesterol
concentration
at
both
examinations
had
a
significant
association
with
mortality
(risk
ratio
164
95%
CI
113-236)
We
have
been
unable
to
explain
our
results
These
data
cast
doubt
on
the
scientific
justification
for
lowering
cholesterol
to
very
low
concentrations
(<465
mmol/L)
in
elderly
people
