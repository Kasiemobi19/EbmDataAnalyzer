Splinting
vs
surgery
in
the
treatment
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Carpal
tunnel
syndrome
(CTS)
can
be
treated
with
nonsurgical
or
surgical
options
However
there
is
no
consensus
on
the
most
effective
method
of
treatment
To
compare
the
short-term
and
long-term
efficacy
of
splinting
and
surgery
for
relieving
the
symptoms
of
CTS
A
randomized
controlled
trial
conducted
from
October
1998
to
April
2000
at
13
neurological
outpatient
clinics
in
the
Netherlands
A
total
of
176
patients
with
clinically
and
electrophysiologically
confirmed
idiopathic
CTS
were
assigned
to
wrist
splinting
during
the
night
for
at
least
6
weeks
(89
patients)
or
open
carpal
tunnel
release
(87
patients)
147
patients
(84%)
completed
the
final
follow-up
assessment
18
months
after
randomization
General
improvement
number
of
nights
waking
up
due
to
symptoms
and
severity
of
symptoms
In
the
intention-to-treat
analyses
surgery
was
more
effective
than
splinting
on
all
outcome
measures
The
success
rates
(based
on
general
improvement)
after
3
months
were
80%
for
the
surgery
group
(62/78
patients)
vs
54%
for
the
splinting
group
(46/86
patients)
which
is
a
difference
of
26%
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
12%-40%
P<001)
After
18
months
the
success
rates
increased
to
90%
for
the
surgery
group
(61/68
patients)
vs
75%
for
the
splinting
group
(59/79
patients)
which
is
a
difference
of
15%
(95%
CI
3%-27%
P
=02)
However
by
that
time
41%
of
patients
(32/79)
in
the
splint
group
had
also
received
the
surgery
treatment
Treatment
with
open
carpal
tunnel
release
surgery
resulted
in
better
outcomes
than
treatment
with
wrist
splinting
for
patients
with
CTS
