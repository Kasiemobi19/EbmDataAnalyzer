Probiotics
in

Abstract
Text
This
review
was
designed
to
assess
the
evidence
from
randomized
controlled
trials
on
effects
of
probiotics
in
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
acute
infectious
diarrhea
in
infants
and
children
A
systematic
review
of
published
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trials
on
probiotics
in
the
treatment
or
prevention
of
acute
diarrhea
defined
as
>3
loose
or
watery
stools
per
24
hours
in
infants
and
children
The
use
of
probiotics
as
compared
with
placebo
was
associated
with
a
significantly
reduced
risk
of
diarrhea
lasting
>3
days
The
pooled
estimate
risk
was
043
(95%
CI
034-053)
with
a
fixed-effect
model
and
remained
significant
in
a
random-effect
model
(040
95%
CI
028-057)
Only
Lactobacillus
GG
showed
a
consistent
effect
Probiotics
significantly
reduced
the
duration
of
diarrhea
when
compared
with
placebo
particularly
in
rotaviral
gastroenteritis-the
pooled
weighted
mean
difference
(WMD)
assuming
the
random-effect
model
was
-201
hours
(95%
CI
-261
to
-142)
and
-248
(95%
CI
-318
to
-179)
respectively
A
meta-analysis
of
the
prevention
studies
was
not
feasible
because
of
significant
clinical
and
statistical
heterogeneity
There
is
evidence
of
a
clinically
significant
benefit
of
probiotics
in
the
treatment
of
acute
infectious
diarrhea
in
infants
and
children
particularly
in
rotaviral
gastroenteritis
Lactobacillus
GG
showed
the
most
consistent
effect
although
other
probiotic
strains
may
also
be
effective
Further
research
is
needed
Clinical
and
statistical
heterogeneity
of
the
prophylactic
interventions
preclude
drawing
firm
conclusions
about
the
efficacy
of
probiotics
in
preventing
acute
gastroenteritis
