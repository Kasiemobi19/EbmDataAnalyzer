Two-week
oral
treatment
of
tinea
pedis
comparing
terbinafine
(250
mg/day)
with
itraconazole
(100
mg/day)
a
double-blind
multicentre
study
Abstract
Text
In
this
randomized
double-blind
trial
two
new
antifungal
compounds
were
compared
in
patients
with
interdigital
or
more
extensive
forms
of
tinea
pedis
Two
weeks
of
oral
treatment
with
either
terbinafine
an
allylamine
and
new
chemical
entity
250
mg
daily
or
itraconazole
100
mg
daily
was
given
to
366
patients
(184
terbinafine
182
itraconazole)
Of
13
patients
who
did
not
return
after
the
first
visit
11
were
lost
to
follow-up
(five
on
terbinafine
six
on
itraconazole)
and
two
reported
adverse
events
Another
nine
patients
(three
on
terbinafine
and
six
on
itraconazole)
were
excluded
because
it
was
uncertain
to
which
group
they
were
randomized
A
central
laboratory
performed
both
the
mycology
and
safety
tests
In
355
patients
who
received
the
study
medications
and
were
available
for
analysis
of
side-effects
18
out
of
179
(100%)
in
the
terbinafine
group
and
10
out
of
176
(57%)
in
the
itraconazole
group
reported
adverse
events
No
new
clinically
significant
laboratory
abnormalities
were
seen
after
treatment
At
week
8
the
efficacy
analysis
in
117
patients
with
mycologically
confirmed
dermatophyte
infections
(51
on
terbinafine
66
on
itraconazole)
showed
that
clinical
symptoms
were
absent
or
minimal
in
941%
of
the
terbinafine
and
727%
of
the
itraconazole
group
(P
=
00095)
mycology
was
negative
in
863%
of
the
terbinafine
and
545%
of
the

group
(P

in
the

the

was
