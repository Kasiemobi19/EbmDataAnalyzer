Enlarged
lymph
nodes
of
the
neck
evaluation
with
parallel
extended

sonographic
sequences
Abstract
Text
A
standardized
extended
field-of-view
sonographic
examination
technique
of
the
neck
is
evaluated
In
a
prospective
study
we
screened
50
patients
suspected
of
having
carcinoma
or
lymphoma
for
enlarged
cervical
lymph
nodes
After
conventional
CT
of
the
neck
extended
field-of-view
sonography
was
performed
using
defined
axial
parallel
scanning
sequences
The
results
were
interpreted
separately
by
two
radiologists
Of
245
lymph
nodes
(diameter
1
cm
or
greater)
diagnosed
with
conventional
CT
218
were
correctly
identified
by
extended
field-of-view
ultrasonography
With
respect
to
the
entire
neck
the
sensitivity
of
extended
field-of-view
sonography
was
92%
and
the
correlation
coefficient
between
the
methods
was
r
=
098
(P
<
0001)
Fifteen
of
17
false-negative
lymph
nodes
were
located
in
the
mandibular
angle
region
False-positive
results
(N
=
10)
were
caused
by
misinterpretation
of
primary
tumors
blood
vessels
lobulated
salivary
glands
and
double
imaged
lymph
nodes
Our
results
indicate
that
extended
field-of-view
sonography
in
parallel
scanning
sequences
represents
a
reliable
method
for
the
detection
of
cervical
lymphadenopathy
