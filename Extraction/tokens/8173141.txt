Abstract
Text
To
survey
the
causes
of
clinical
hypomagnesemia
and
Mg
deficiency
The
relationship
of
hypomagnesemia
to
digitalis
toxicity
congestive
heart
failure
arrhythmias
and
acute
myocardial
infarction
is
discussed
as
is
the
clinical
interrelationship
of
Mg
and
K
concentrations
the
principal
intracellular
cations
A
MEDLINE
search
and
retrieval
was
used
to
identify
relevant
references
Clinical
reports
as
well
as
studies
were
selected
for
this
review
There
were
very
few
placebo-controlled
clinical
studies
Clinical
observations
were
related
primarily
to
compilation
of
series
in
which
Mg
was
administered
and
clinical
results
reported
In
addition
conclusions
derived
from
review
articles
on
the
subject
of
clinical
Mg
depletion
were
used
Clinical
diagnosis
of
Mg
deficiency
is
ascertained
most
expeditiously
by
estimating
serum
Mg
concentrations
Although
available
on
order
by
physicians
the
lack
of
routine
serum
Mg
analysis
as
part
of
the
"electrolyte
panel"
impedes
the
diagnosis
of
clinical
Mg
deficiency
Renal
loss
of
Mg
resulting
from
the
widespread
use
of
loop
diuretics
is
responsible
for
significant
numbers
of
patients
with
Mg
deficiency
and
hypomagnesemia
Life-threatening
cardiac
arrhythmias
and
seizures
represent
the
most
serious
manifestations
of
clinical
hypomagnesemia
and
Mg
depletion
In
the
most
critically
ill
patients
treatment
with
intravenous
Mg
is
recommended
Oral
repletion
of
Mg
is
reserved
for
the
less
critically
ill
hospitalized
patients
and
ambulatory
patients
Close
attention
must
be
paid
to
optimizing
K
replenishment
in
hypokalemic
patients
by
concurrent
treatment
of
any
accompanying
hypomagnesemia
to
avoid
the
problem
of
refractory
K
repletion
Hypomagnesemia
is
one
of
the
most
frequent
serum
electrolyte
abnormalities
in
current
clinical
practice
Routine
inclusion
of
serum
Mg
analysis
in
the
electrolyte
panel
will
enhance
the
clinical
recognition
and
treatment
of
hypomagnesemic
Mg-depleted
patients
Failure
to
respond
to
treatment
of
recurrent
ventricular
tachycardia/fibrillation
to
usual
antiarrhythmic
therapy
in
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
idiopathic
dilated
cardiomyopathy
and
congestive
heart
failure
should
alert
the
clinician
to
consider
administering
intravenous
Mg
Repair
of
coexisting
hypomagnesemia
in
hypokalemic
patients
is
essential
to
avoid
the
problem
of
refractory
K
repletion
caused
by
coexisting
Mg
depletion
More
controlled
clinical
studies
of
Mg
deficiency
are
necessary
to
ascertain
the
cost-effectiveness
of
Mg
replacement
therapy
