Title
Breast-feeding
and
childhood
obesity--a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
relationship
between
breast-feeding
and
obesity
in
childhood
Systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
of
published
epidemiological
studies
(cohort
case-control
or
cross-sectional
studies)
comparing
early
feeding-mode
and
adjusting
for
potential
confounding
factors
Electronic
databases
were
searched
and
reference
lists
of
relevant
articles
were
checked
Calculations
of
pooled
estimates
were
conducted
in
fixed-
and
random-effects
models
Heterogeneity
was
tested
by
Q-test
Publication
bias
was
assessed
from
funnel
plots
and
by
a
linear
regression
method
Odds
ratio
(OR)
for
obesity
in
childhood
defined
as
body
mass
index
(BMI)
percentiles
Nine
studies
with
more
than
69000
participants
met
the
inclusion
criteria
The
meta-analysis
showed
that
breast-feeding
reduced
the
risk
of
obesity
in
childhood
significantly
The
adjusted
odds
ratio
was
078
95%
CI
(071
085)
in
the
fixed
model
The
assumption
of
homogeneity
of
results
of
the
included
studies
could
not
be
refuted
(Q-test
for
heterogeneity
P>03)
stratified
analyses
showed
no
differences
regarding
different
study
types
age
groups
definition
of
breast-feeding
or
obesity
and
number
of
confounding
factors
adjusted
for
A
dose-dependent
effect
of
breast-feeding
duration
on
the
prevalence
of
obesity
was
reported
in
four
studies
Funnel
plot
regression
gave
no
indication
of
publication
bias
Breast-feeding
seems
to
have
a
small
but
consistent
protective
effect
against
obesity
in
children
