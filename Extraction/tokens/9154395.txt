Abstract
Text
We
undertook
a
prospective
multicentre
double-blind
placebo
controlled
randomised
parallel-group
study
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
the
topical
1%
emulsion
gel
formulation
of
Lamisil
in
the
treatment
of
tinea
corporis/cruris
Eighty-three
patients
with
clinically
and
mycologically
confirmed
tinea
corporis/cruris
were
enrolled
from
6
dermatology
practices
Of
the
62
patients
in
the
intent-to-treat
population
29
were
randomised
to
1%
Lamisil
emulsion
gel
(23
male
6
female
mean
age
42
years
range
19-79
years)
and
33
to
placebo
(25
male
8
female
mean
age
36
years
range
16-73
years)
The
gels
were
applied
once
daily
for
1
week
Mycological
cure
(negative
microscopy
and
culture
results)
and
effectiveness
of
treatment
(mycological
cure
plus
no
or
minimal
signs
and
symptoms)
were
measured
on
day
7
weeks
2
4
and
8
and
at
the
end
of
the
study
At
the
study
end
rates
mycological
cure
were
83%
for
Lamisil
1%
emulsion
gel
and
27%
for
placebo
gel
(p
<
0001)
with
respective
rates
for
effective
treatment
of
83
and
21%
(p
<
0001)
Complete
cure
was
recorded
for
59%
of
patients
receiving
Lamisil
1%
emulsion
gel
and
13%
of
patient
receiving
placebo
gel
(p
<
0001)
We
conclude
that
a
1-week
course
of
Lamisil
1%
emulsion
gel
is
significantly
more
effective
in
the
treatment
of
tinea
corporis/cruris
than
placebo
gel
in
respect
of
complete
cure
mycological
cure
and
effective
treatment
