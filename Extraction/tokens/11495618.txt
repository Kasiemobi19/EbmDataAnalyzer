Risk
factors
for
meningococcal
disease
in
college
students
Abstract
Text
Elevated
rates
of
meningococcal
disease
were
noted
among
18-
to
22-year-olds
in
the
mid-1990s
However
national
data
on
rates
of
meningococcal
disease
in
US
college
students
were
not
collected
until
1998
To
determine
rates
of
meningococcal
disease
in
US
college
students
and
to
identify
risk
factors
for
meningococcal
disease
in
this
population
Prospective
surveillance
study
with
nested
case-control
study
of
US
college
students
with
meningococcal
infection
from
September
1
1998
to
August
31
1999
Fifty
state
health
departments
and
231
college
health
centers
participated
Incidence
of
and
risk
factors
for
meningococcal
disease
in
US
college
students
Ninety-six
cases
of
meningococcal
disease
were
identified
The
incidence
rate
for
undergraduates
was
07
per
100
000
persons
vs
14
per
100
000
for
the
general
population
of
18-
to
23-year-old
nonstudents
(P<001)
Freshmen
living
in
dormitories
had
the
highest
incidence
rate
at
51
per
100
000
Of
the
79
case-patients
for
whom
information
was
available
54
(68%)
had
illness
due
to
vaccine-preventable
meningococcal
serogroups
On
multivariable
analysis
of
case-control
study
data
freshmen
who
lived
in
dormitories
had
an
elevated
risk
of
meningococcal
disease
(matched
odds
ratio
36
95%
confidence
interval
16-85
P
=003)
compared
with
other
college
students
Freshmen
who
live
in
dormitories
have
an
independent
elevated
risk
of
meningococcal
disease
compared
with
other
college
students
Use
of
the
currently
available
quadrivalent
polysaccharide
vaccine
among
college
students
could
substantially
decrease
their
risk
of
meningococcal
disease
