Pharmacologic
stress
testing
for
coronary
disease
diagnosis
A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Although
noninvasive
pharmacologic
stress
tests
are
widely
used
their
relative
performance
is
not
clear
We
compared
the
performance
of
pharmacologic
stress
tests
combined
with
echocardiography
or
nuclear
imaging
for
the
diagnosis
of
coronary
disease
We
performed
a
regression
meta-analysis
of
published
data
We
included
studies
published
between
January
1975
and
June
1999
in
which
subjects
underwent
echocardiographic
or
single-photon
emission
computed
tomography
(SPECT)
stress
testing
with
adenosine
dipyridamole
or
dobutamine
for
diagnosis
of
coronary
artery
disease
All
subjects
also
underwent
coronary
angiography
Two
independent
reviewers
abstracted
population
characteristics
technical
factors
methodologic
factors
and
results
and
calculated
test
sensitivity
and
specificity
Eighty-two
studies
met
the
inclusion
criteria
The
sensitivity
of
dipyridamole
SPECT
imaging
89%
(95%
CI
84%-93%)
was
higher
than
that
of
dipyridamole
echocardiography
but
the
specificity
of
dipyridamole
SPECT
imaging
65%
(95%
CI
54%-74%)
was
lower
than
that
of
dipyridamole
echocardiography
Dipyridamole
and
adenosine
tests
had
similar
sensitivities
and
specificities
The
sensitivity
of
dobutamine
echocardiography
80%
(95%
CI
77%-83%)
was
similar
to
that
of
dobutamine
SPECT
imaging
but
dobutamine
echocardiography
had
a
higher
specificity
84%
(95%
CI
80%-86%)
than
dobutamine
SPECT
imaging
did
The
findings
of
our
study
can
be
used
to
guide
the
selection
of
the
optimal
pharmacologic
stress
test
for
each
patient
Maximum
sensitivity
can
be
attained
by
use
of
a
vasodilator
combined
with
SPECT
imaging
Maximum
specificity
can
be
attained
by
use
of
a
vasodilator
with
echocardiography
The
highest
combination
of
sensitivity
and
specificity
can
be
attained
with
dobutamine
echocardiography
