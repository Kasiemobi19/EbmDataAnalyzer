Male
hypogonadism

an
update
on
diagnosis
and
treatment
Abstract
Text
Male
hypogonadism
is
one
of
the
most
common
endocrinologic
syndromes
The
diagnosis
is
based
on
clinical
signs
and
symptoms
plus
laboratory
confirmation
via
the
measurement
of
low
morning
testosterone
levels
on
two
different
occasions
Serum
luteinizing
hormone
and
follicle-stimulating
hormone
levels
distinguish
between
primary
(hypergonadotropic)
and
secondary
(hypogonadotropic)
hypogonadism
Hypogonadism
associated
with
aging
(andropause)
may
present
a
mixed
picture
with
low
testosterone
levels
and
low
to
low-normal
gonadotropin
levels
Androgen
replacement
therapy
in
hypogonadal
men
has
many
potential
benefits
improved
sexual
function
an
enhanced
sense
of
well-being
increased
lean
body
mass
decreased
body
fat
and
increased
bone
density
However
it
also
carries
potential
risks
including
the
possibility
of
stimulating
the
growth
of
an
occult
prostate
cancer
The
benefits
of
androgen
therapy
outweigh
the
risks
in
men
with
classic
hypogonadism
However
for
men
with
mild
hypogonadism
or
andropause
the
balance
between
benefits
and
risks
is
not
always
clear
Unfortunately
studies
to
date
have
included
too
small
a
number
of
patients
and
have
been
too
short
in
duration
to
provide
meaningful
data
on
the
long-term
risks
versus
the
benefits
of
androgen
replacement
therapy
in
these
populations
Several
products
are
currently
marketed
for
the
treatment
of
male
hypogonadism
Weekly-to-biweekly
injections
of
testosterone
cypionate
(cipionate)
or
testosterone
enanthate
(enantate)
are
widely
used
as
they
are
economical
and
generally
well
tolerated
However
once-daily
transdermal
therapies
have
become
increasingly
popular
and
now
include
both
patch
and
gel
systems
Intramuscular
injection
of
testosterone
undecanoate
is
an
attractive
new
therapy
that
can
be
administered
quarterly
To
confirm
an
adequate
replacement
dosage
assessment
of
clinical
responses
and
measurement
of
serum
testosterone
levels
generally
suffice
For
selected
men
serial
measurement
of
bone
mineral
density
during
androgen
therapy
might
be
helpful
to
confirm
end-organ
effects
For
men
aged
>50
years
we
advocate
measurement
of
hematocrit
for
detection
of
polycythemia
and
a
digital
rectal
examination
with
a
serum
prostate-specific
antigen
level
measurement
for
prostate
cancer
screening
during
the
first
few
months
of
androgen
therapy
Subsequently
a
hematocrit
should
be
obtained
yearly
or
after
changes
in
therapy
and
annual
prostate
cancer
screening
can
be
offered
to
the
patient
after
a
discussion
of
its
risks
and
benefits
