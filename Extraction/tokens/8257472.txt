Effect
of
early
amniotomy
on
the
risk
of
dystocia
in
nulliparous
women
The
Canadian
Early
Amniotomy
Study
Group
Abstract
Text
Early
amniotomy
has
been
advocated
as
a
means
of
preventing
dystocia
but
its
efficacy
has
not
been
studied
prospectively
The
purpose
of
this
multicenter
study
was
to
determine
whether
routine
early
amniotomy
reduces
the
risk
of
dystocia
for
nulliparous
women
in
spontaneous
labor
We
studied
925
nulliparous
women
in
labor
who
were
stratified
according
to
the
degree
of
cervical
dilatation
(<
3
cm
vs
>
or
=
3
cm)
and
randomly
assigned
to
either
early
rupture
of
the
membranes
(amniotomy
group)
or
conservative
management
of
labor
(conservative-management
group)
Dystocia
was
defined
as
a
period
of
at
least
four
hours
after
dilatation
of
the
cervix
to
3
cm
had
been
reached
during
which
the
mean
rate
of
cervical
dilatation
was
less
than
05
cm
per
hour
Dystocia
was
significantly
less
frequent
in
the
amniotomy
group
than
in
the
conservative-management
group
(34
percent
vs
45
percent
relative
risk
08
95
percent
confidence
interval
06
to
09)
The
median
length
of
time
from
randomization
to
full
dilatation
was
136
minutes
shorter
in
the
amniotomy
group
and
there
was
a
trend
toward
less
frequent
use
of
oxytocin
among
the
women
assigned
to
amniotomy
(36
percent
vs
41
percent
relative
risk
09
95
percent
confidence
interval
08
to
10)
In
a
stratified
analysis
the
frequency
of
dystocia
associated
with
amniotomy
was
reduced
only
among
women
with
>
or
=
3
cm
initial
dilatation
The
cesarean-section
rate
was
similar
in
the
two
groups
(amniotomy
12
percent
conservative
management
11
percent)
There
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
in
outcome
between
the
infants
delivered
by
the
women
in
the
two
groups
the
measures
of
an
adverse
outcome
included
admission
to
a
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
five-minute
Apgar
score
below
7
and
arterial
cord-blood
pH
below
72
Early
amniotomy
is
an
effective
method
of
shortening
the
duration
of
labor
and
reducing
the
frequency
of
dystocia
among
nulliparous
women
in
labor
but
it
does
not
lower
the
rate
of
cesarean
section
