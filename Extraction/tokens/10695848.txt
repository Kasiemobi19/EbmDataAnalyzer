The
efficacy
of
magnetic

imaging
in
acute
knee
injuries
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
clinical
efficacy
of
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI)
of
the
knee
in
acute
injuries
with
indeterminate
clinical
findings
using
arthroscopy
as
a
gold
standard
A
prospective
double-blind
study
was
performed
All
patients
underwent
MRI
on
a
15
T
magnet
using
dual
spin
echo
pulse
sequences
This
was
followed
by
arthroscopy
Tertiary
care
referral
center
Twenty-three
patients
with
an
average
age
of
26
years
satisfied
the
study
criteria
Patients
had
to
have
been
seen
by
one
of
two
orthopaedic
surgeons
within
6
weeks
of
sudden
trauma
to
the
knee
complicated
by
a
hemarthrosis
clinical
assessment
of
which
was
equivocal
The
respective
sensitivity
and
specificity
for
MRI
of
the
knee
were
90%
(18/20)
and
67%
(2/3)
for
detecting
any
anterior
cruciate
ligament
injury
50%
(1/2)
and
86%
(18/21)
for
detecting
medial
meniscal
tears
and
88%
(7/8)
and
73%
(11/15)
for
detecting
lateral
meniscal
tears
MRI
also
identified
injuries
that
could
not
be
assessed
on
arthroscopy
including
14
bone
bruises
five
posterior
cruciate
ligament
tears
nine
medial
collateral
ligament
tears
and
one
lateral
collateral
ligament
tear
The
detection
of
composite
injury
requiring
surgical
intervention
yielded
a
sensitivity
of
100%
(16/16)
and
a
specificity
of
71%
(5/7)
Prospective
use
of
MRI
evaluation
of
the
knee
could
have
prevented
22%
(5/23)
of
diagnostic
arthroscopic
procedures
Equivocal
clinical
findings
in
patients
with
acute
knee
injury
should
lead
to
use
of
MRI
in
an
appropriate
clinical
setting
To
our
knowledge
a
prospective
study
of
the
efficacy
of
MRI
of
the
knee
in
this
patient
population
has
not
been
reported
In
the
presence
of
such
inclusion
criteria
the
results
of
our
study
support
the
use
of
early
MRI
to
guide
further
surgical
management
