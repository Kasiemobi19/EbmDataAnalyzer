Title
Perimenopausal
bleeding
patterns
and
pathologic
findings
Abstract
Text
The
charts
of
500
sequential
perimenopausal
patients
were
reviewed
and
their
alterations
in
menstrual
flow
were
characterized
as
fitting
one
of
three
patterns
Sixty-two
patients
(12%)
had
sudden
amenorrhea
347
(70%)
had
oligomenorrhea
and/or
hypomenorrhea
and
91
(18%)
had
menorrhagia
metrorrhagia
and/or
hypermenorrhea
All
of
the
patients
in
the
menorrhagia/metrorrhagia
and/or
hypermenorrhea
group
had
histologic
evaluations
to
rule
out
the
presence
of
premalignant
or
malignant
disease
17
women
(19%)
in
this
group
had
premalignant
or
malignant
findings
In
addition
4
of
the
5
women
with
malignancies
had
intermenstrual
bleeding
Of
the
9
women
in
the
study
with
intermenstrual
bleeding
4
had
invasive
cancer
and
2
had
endometrial
hyperplasia
This
study
documents
and
highlights
the
high
incidence
of
premalignant
and
malignant
findings
in
perimenopausal
patients
with
bleeding
patterns
other
than
amenorrhea
or
oligomenorrhea/hypomenorrhea
and
underscores
the
need
for
perimenopausal
women
with
menorrhagia
metrorrhagia
and/or
hypermenorrhea
to
undergo
thorough
evaluation
