The
evolving
role
of
itraconazole
fluconazole
and
terbinafine
in
the
treatment
of
tinea
capitis
Abstract
Text
Tinea
capitis
has
become
an
increasing
public
health
concern
in
the
last
decade
The
increased
incidence
of
the
disease
its
sometimes
subtle
nonspecific
clinical
presentation
and
the
development
of
tolerance
to
griseofulvin
therapy
have
led
to
the
need
for
alternative
safe
efficacious
inexpensive
therapies
that
work
rapidly
Itraconazole
fluconazole
and
terbinafine
all
possess
pharmacologic
and
pharmacokinetic
characteristics
that
theoretically
would
make
them
ideal
therapies
for
tinea
capitis
However
few
randomized
double
blind
controlled
studies
using
these
agents
have
been
published
Thus
far
none
have
been
conducted
in
the
United
States
The
best
available
data
support
the
utility
and
safety
of
the
new
antifungals
in
the
treatment
of
tinea
capitis
However
one
must
keep
in
mind
that
they
are
not
yet
approved
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
for
this
indication
Safety
and
cost
considerations
favor
terbinafine
for
the
treatment
of
T
tonsurans
infections
M
canis
infections
may
respond
better
to
itraconazole
but
good
controlled
studies
to
confirm
this
speculation
have
not
been
conducted
Short
course
and
pulse
dosing
are
particularly
exciting
options
that
may
decrease
cost
and
lower
the
risk
of
adverse
side
effects
Further
useful
information
will
hopefully
come
from
future
randomized
double
blind
studies
that
will
include
patients
from
the
United
States
Studies
using
standardized
definitions
of
disease
cure
and
appropriate
follow-up
evaluation
of
clinical
and
mycologic
cure
will
best
identify
the
optimal
therapy
for
pediatric
tinea
capitis
infections
The
new
systemic
antifungals
may
provide
more
therapeutic
options
for
fungal
infections
of
the
scalp
Note
added
in
proof
A
recent
trial
comparing
short
course
terbinafine
and
intraconazole
therapy
demonstrated
that
2-week
therapy
with
either
drug
provided
good
results
and
high
cure
rates
