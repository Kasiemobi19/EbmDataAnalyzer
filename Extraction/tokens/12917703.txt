Abstract
Text
To
conduct
a
descriptive
systematic
review
into
the
nature
and
effectiveness
of
family
involvement
in
weight
control
weight
maintenance
and
weight-loss
interventions
We
searched
Medline
and
Psyclit
for
English
language
papers
describing
randomised
trials
with
at
least
1-y
follow-up
that
evaluated
interventions
incorporating
a
family-based
component
Studies
involving
people
with
eating
disorders
learning
disabilities
and
undernutrition
or
malnutrition
were
excluded
Data
were
extracted
on
characteristics
of
the
participants
study
design
target
behaviours
nature
of
the
intervention
and
study
outcomes
A
taxonomy
was
developed
and
used
to
classify
family
involvement
in
behaviour
change
interventions
Interventions
were
also
classified
according
to
an
existing
taxonomy
that
characterised
the
behaviour
change
techniques
employed
A
total
of
21
papers
describing
16
intervention
studies
were
identified
Studies
were
small
(mean
sample
size
52)
heterogeneous
poorly
described
but
with
few
losses
to
follow-up
(median
15%)
The
majority
were
North
American
and
aimed
at
weight
loss
Few
studies
described
a
theoretical
underpinning
to
the
behaviour
change
techniques
employed
There
was
a
suggestion
that
spouse
involvement
increased
effectiveness
but
that
adolescents
achieved
greater
weight
loss
when
treated
alone
In
studies
including
children
beneficial
effects
were
seen
when
greater
numbers
of
behaviour
change
techniques
were
taught
to
both
parents
and
children
Relatively
few
intervention
studies
exist
in
this
important
area
particularly
studies
targeting
adolescents
and
they
highlight
continued
uncertainty
about
how
best
to
involve
family
members
The
studies
provide
limited
support
for
the
involvement
of
spouses
They
suggest
that
parental
involvement
is
associated
with
weight
loss
in
children
and
that
use
of
a
greater
range
of
behaviour
change
techniques
improves
weight
outcomes
for
both
parents
and
children
The
development
of
future
interventions
and
assessment
of
factors
influencing
effectiveness
may
be
improved
by
paying
careful
attention
to
which
family
members
are
targeted
and
how
they
are
involved
in
the
intervention
in
terms
of
setting
goals
for
behaviour
change
providing
support
and
training
in
behaviour
change
techniques
