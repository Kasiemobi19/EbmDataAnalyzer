Comparison
of
ultrasound
radiography
and
clinical
examination
in
the
diagnosis
of
acute
maxillary
sinusitis
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
discriminative
properties
of
the
methods
for
diagnosing
acute
maxillary
sinusitis
(AMS)
in
unselected
patients
The
study
design
was
a
systematic
review
of
evaluation
studies
identified
by
using
Medline
by
searching
reference
lists
by
hand
searches
and
by
contacting
investigators
Evaluation
studies
were
conducted
anywhere
in
the
world
Subjects
were
adults
with
suspected
AMS
Main
outcome
measures
were
sensitivity
specificity
positive
and
negative
likelihood
ratios
of
the
primary
studies
weighted
means
of
these
parameters
in
each
comparison
(clinical
examination
radiography
and
ultrasound
compared
to
a
reference
standard
in
diagnosing
AMS)
and
summary
ROC
curves
and
their
Q*
points
where
sensitivity
equals
specificity
For
the
years
from
1962
to
present
49
study
reports
were
found
11
articles
on
studies
that
included
a
total
of
1144
patients
were
eligible
Compared
to
sinus
puncture
radiography
was
the
most
accurate
method
for
diagnosing
AMS
the
Q*
point
on
the
summary
ROC
curve
was
082
(95%
confidence
interval
CI
078-085)
Ultrasound
was
slightly
less
accurate
than
radiography
compared
to
sinus
puncture
(Q*
080
95%
CI
076-083)
Only
two
articles
reported
clinical
examination
compared
to
sinus
puncture
and
the
Q*
for
them
was
075
(95%
058-086)
Clinical
examination
is
a
rather
unreliable
method
for
diagnosing
AMS
even
in
the
hands
of
experienced
specialists
Using
radiography
or
ultrasound
improves
the
accuracy
of
diagnosis
The
diagnosis
of
AMS
is
rarely
studied
in
primary
care
settings
Future
comparative
trials
should
preferably
combine
diagnosis
and
treatment
evaluating
the
two
aspects
of
clinical
management
as
unit
