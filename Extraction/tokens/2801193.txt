Title
Macrocytosis
as
an
indicator
of
human
disease
Abstract
Text
Adult
patients
with
macrocytosis
defined
as
a
mean
corpuscular
volume
(MCV)
greater
than
100
femtoliters
were
studied
to
assess
the
importance
of
an
elevated
MCV
After
eliminating
pregnant
and
postpartum
patients
and
patients
receiving
medications
known
to
cause
macrocytosis
(eg
phenytoin
zidovudine
and
chemotherapeutic
agents)
80
patients
were
identified
and
studied
Sixty-seven
diagnoses
were
made
in
56
patients
These
diagnoses
were
in
descending
order
alcoholism
hematological
disorders
habitual
drinking
B12
deficiency
chronic
liver
disease
folic
acid
deficiency
hypothyroidism
anorexia
nervosa
and
reticulocytosis
While
an
elevated
MCV
is
neither
sensitive
nor
specific
for
any
one
disease
state
an
elevated
MCV
should
raise
suspicions
of
underlying
pathology
