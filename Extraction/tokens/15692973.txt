Abstract
Text
The
signs
and
symptoms
of
ankylosing
spondylitis
(AS)
respond
inadequately
to
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
corticosteroids
and
disease-modifying
antirheumatic
drugs
in
quite
a
number
of
patients
Tumor
necrosis
factor
inhibitors
have
demonstrated
success
in
reducing
AS
disease
activity
in
a
limited
number
of
clinical
trials
The
objective
of
this
multicenter
randomized
placebo-controlled
study
was
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
infliximab
in
patients
with
AS
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
infusions
of
placebo
or
5
mg/kg
infliximab

The
primary
end
point
in
this
study
was
the
proportion
of
patients
with
a
20%
improvement
response
according
to
the
ASAS
International
Working
Group
criteria
(ASAS20
responders)
at
week
24
Of
the
357
patients
screened
201
were
assigned
to
receive
5
mg/kg
infliximab
and
78
were
assigned
to
receive
placebo
After
24
weeks
612%
of
patients
in
the
infliximab
group
were
ASAS20
responders
compared
with
192%
of
patients
in
the
placebo
group
(P
<
0001)
Clinical
benefit
was
observed
in
patients
receiving
infliximab
as
early
as
week
2
and
was
maintained
over
the
24-week
study
period
Patients
receiving
infliximab
also
showed
significant
improvements
in
the
BASDAI

score
of
the

Adverse
events
were
reported
by
822%
of
patients
receiving
infliximab
and
by
720%
of
patients
receiving
placebo
however
most
adverse
events
in
both
treatment
groups
were
mild
or
moderate
in
severity
Infliximab
was
well
tolerated
and
effective
in
a
large
cohort
of
patients
with
AS
during
a
24-week
study
period
