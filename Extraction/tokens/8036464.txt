Abstract
Text
All
68308
inhabitants
of
GÃ¶teborg
born
between
1918
and
1931
were
randomly
divided
into
a
test
and
a
control
group
The
subjects
in
the
test
group
were
invited
to
perform
Hemoccult
II
fecal
occult
blood
testing
on
3
days
and
to
repeat
the
test
after
16
to
24
months
In
the
prevalence
screening
21347
(63%)
performed
the
test
and
in
the
rescreening
19991
(60%)
Investigation
of
the
942
(44%)
with
positive
tests
in
the
prevalence
screening
showed
47
cancers
and
129
subjects
with
adenomas
>
or
=
10
cm
In
the
rescreening
51%
had
a
positive
test
and
34
cancers
and
122
subjects
with
adenomas
(>
or
=
10
cm)
were
found
among
those
Cancer
had
also
been
diagnosed
in
19
subjects
in
the
interval
between
the
two
screening
occasions
and
in
15
subjects
among
the
non-responders
Forty-four
cancers
had
been
diagnosed
in
the
control
group
during
the
same
period
Cancers
detected
by
screening
were
at
a
less
advanced
stage
than
in
the
control
group
It
is
too
early
to
show
any
effect
of
screening
on
mortality
from
colorectal
cancer
