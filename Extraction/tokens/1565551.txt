Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
efficacy
of
amoxicillin
prophylaxis
and
of
tympanostomy
tube
insertion
in
preventing
recurrences
of
acute
otitis
media
we
randomized
264
children
7
to
35
months
of
age
who
had
a
history
of
recurrent
otitis
media
but
were
free
of
middle
ear
effusion
to
receive
either
amoxicillin
prophylaxis
bilateral
tympanostomy
tube
insertion
or
placebo
The
average
rate
of
new
episodes
per
child
year
of
either
acute
otitis
media
or
otorrhea
was
060
in
the
amoxicillin
group
108
in
the
placebo
group
and
102
in
the
tympanostomy
tube
group
(amoxicillin
vs
placebo
P
less
than
0001
tubes
vs
placebo
P
=
025)
The
average
proportion
of
time
with
otitis
media
of
any
type
was
100%
in
the
amoxicillin
group
150%
in
the
placebo
group
and
66%
in
the
tympanostomy
tube
group
(amoxicillin
vs
placebo
P
=
003
tubes
vs
placebo
P
less
than
0001)
At
the
2-year
end
point
the
rate
of
attrition
was
422%
in
the
amoxicillin
group
455%
in
the
placebo
group
and
267%
in
the
tympanostomy
tube
group
Adverse
drug
reactions
occurred
in
70%
of
the
amoxicillin
group
and
persistent
tympanic
membrane
perforations
developed
in
39%
of
the
tympanostomy
tube
group
The
observed
degree
of
efficacy
of
amoxicillin
prophylaxis
and
of
tympanostomy
tube
insertion
must
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
fact
that
study
subjects
proved
not
to
have
been
at
as
high
risk
for
acute
otitis
media
as
had
been
anticipated
and
in
view
of
the
differential
attrition
rates(ABSTRACT
