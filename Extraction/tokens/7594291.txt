Steroid
versus
placebo
injection
for
trigger
finger
Abstract
Text
The
ability
of
a
single
injection
of
steroid
and
lidocaine
to
bring
about
cure
of
primary
trigger
finger
was
determined
and
compared
with
a
control
placebo
injection
of
only
lidocaine
Twenty-four
patients
were
randomized
to
the
therapeutic
or
control
group
and
were
followed
prospectively
One
physician
administered
the
injection
another
the
clinical
examination
after
injection
and
a
third
evaluated
the
results
blindly
Patients
were
not
told
to
which
group
they
were
assigned
Nine
of
the
14
patients
in
the
steroid
group
versus
two
of
the
ten
patients
in
the
placebo
group
were
cured
of
trigger
finger
at
final
follow-up
examination
After
injection
seven
patients
had
immediate
but
temporary
relief
of
triggering
because
of
flexor
sheath
distention
One
injection
cured
64%
[corrected]
of
patients
with
primary
trigger
finger
with
no
side
effect
and
is
the
recommended
nonsurgical
treatment
