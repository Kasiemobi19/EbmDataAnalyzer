Prophylactic
antithrombotic
therapy
for
patients
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
with
or
without
antiphospholipid
antibodies
do
the
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
A
decision
analysis
Abstract
Text
A
high
incidence
of
both
arterial
and
venous
thromboembolic
events
has
been
reported
in
patients
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(SLE)
but
the
risks
and
benefits
of
primary
prophylactic
antithrombotic
therapy
have
not
been
assessed
We
measured
the
clinical
benefit
of
3
antithrombotic
regimens
in
patients
with
SLE
without
antiphospholipid
antibodies
with
anticardiolipin
antibodies
or
with
lupus
anticoagulant
A
Markov
decision
analysis
was
used
to
evaluate
prophylactic
aspirin
therapy
prophylactic
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
and
observation
Input
data
were
obtained
by
literature
review
Clinical
practice
was
simulated
in
a
hypothetical
cohort
of
patients
with
SLE
who
had
not
experienced
any
previous
episode
of
arterial
or
venous
thromboembolic
events
For
each
strategy
we
measured
numbers
of
thromboembolic
events
prevented
and
major
bleeding
episodes
induced
and
quality-adjusted
survival
years
Prophylactic
aspirin
therapy
was
the
preferred
strategy
in
all
settings
the
number
of
prevented
thrombotic
events
exceeding
that
of
induced
bleeding
episodes
In
the
baseline
analysis
(40-year-old
patients
with
SLE)
the
gain
in
quality-adjusted
survival
years
achieved
by
prophylactic
aspirin
compared
with
observation
ranged
from
3
months
in
patients
without
antiphospholipid
antibodies
to
11
months
in
patients
with
anticardiolipin
antibodies
or
lupus
anticoagulant
Prophylactic
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
provided
better
results
than
prophylactic
aspirin
only
in
patients
with
lupus
anticoagulant
and
an
estimated
bleeding
risk
of
1%
per
year
or
less
Prophylactic
aspirin
should
be
given
to
all
patients
with
SLE
to
prevent
both
arterial
and
venous
thrombotic
manifestations
especially
in
patients
with
antiphospholipid
antibodies
In
selected
patients
with
lupus
anticoagulant
and
a
low
bleeding
risk
prophylactic
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
may
provide
a
higher
utility
