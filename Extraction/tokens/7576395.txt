Similarities

Abstract
Text
The
rise
in
blood
pressure
(BP)
associated
with
clinical
visit
(white
coat
effect)
may
be
one
basic
mechanism
of
white
coat
hypertension
(persistently
raised
clinic
BP
together
with
a
normal
BP
outside
the
clinic)
but
the
relations
between
white
coat
hypertension
white
coat
effect
and
target
organ
damage
have
not
yet
been
assessed
on
large
populations
Thus
we
performed
24-h
noninvasive
ambulatory
BP
monitoring
and
2D-guided
M-mode
echocardiography
in
1333
untreated
subjects
with
essential
hypertension
and
178
control
normotensive
subjects
White
coat
hypertension
was
defined
by
an
average
daytime
ambulatory
BP
<
131/86
mm
Hg
in
women
and
<
136/87
mm
Hg
in
men
and
its
prevalence
was
189%
(n
=
252)
The
white
coat
effect
was
calculated
for
systolic
and
diastolic
BP
as
the
difference
between
clinic
BP
and
average
daytime
ambulatory
BP
Echocardiographic
left
ventricular
mass
was
slightly
but
not
significantly
greater
in
the
group
with
white
coat
hypertension
than
in
the
normotensive
group
(93

g/m2
P
=

and
increased
in
the
group
with
ambulatory
hypertension
(112
g/m2
P
<
01)
The
prevalence
of
white
coat
hypertension
markedly
decreased

the
