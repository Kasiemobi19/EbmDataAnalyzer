Screening
for
thyroid
disease
an
update

Abstract
Text
To
review
information
on
the
benefits
of
screening
with
a
sensitive
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
(TSH)
test
for
thyroid
dysfunction
in
asymptomatic
patients
seeking
primary
care
for
other
reasons
This
paper
focuses
on
whether
screening
should
be
aimed
at
detection
of
subclinical
thyroid
dysfunction
and
whether
persons
with
mildly
abnormal
TSH
levels
can
benefit
A
MEDLINE
search
for
studies
of
screening
for
thyroid
dysfunction
and
of
treatment
for
complications
of
subclinical
thyroid
dysfunction
Studies
of
screening
with
thyroid
function
tests
in
the
general
adult
population
or
in
patients
seen
in
the
general
office
setting
were
selected
(n=33)
All
controlled
studies
of
treatment
in
patients
with
subclinical
hypothyroidism
or
subclinical
hyperthyroidism
were
also
included
(n=23)
The
prevalence
of
overt
and
subclinical
thyroid
dysfunction
the
evidence
for
the
efficacy
of
treatment
and
the
incidence
of
complications
in
defined
age
and
sex
groups
were
extracted
from
each
study
Screening
can
detect
symptomatic
but
unsuspected
overt
thyroid
dysfunction
The
yield
is
highest
for
women
older
than
50
years
of
age
In
this
group
1
in
71
women
screened
could
benefit
from
relief
of
symptoms
Evidence
of
the
efficacy
of
treatment
for
subclinical
thyroid
dysfunction
is
inconclusive
Even
though
treatment
for
subclinical
thyroid
dysfunction
is
controversial
office-based
screening
to
detect
overt
thyroid
dysfunction
may
be
indicated
in
women
older
than
50
years
of
age
Large
randomized
trials
are
needed
to
determine
the
likelihood
that
treatment
will
improve
quality
of
life
in
otherwise
healthy
patients
who
have
mildly
elevated
TSH
levels
