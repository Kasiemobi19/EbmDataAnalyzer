Title
Efficacy
and
safety
of
butenafine
in
superficial
dermatophytoses
(tinea
pedis
tinea
cruris
tinea
corporis)
Abstract
Text
Superficial
dermatophytoses
of
skin
are
very
common
infections
seen
in
clinical
practice
Besides
topical
imidazoles
triazoles
and
allylamines
topical
butenafine
(a
benzylamine
derivative)
is
a
novel
agent
with
broad
antifungal
activity
One
hundred
and
eleven
patients
with
tinea
infections
were
enrolled
in
this
multicentric
randomised
single-blind
non-comparative
study
which
involved
application
of
butenafine
(1%)
cream
in
tinea
pedis
(4
weeks)
and
tinea
cruris
and
tinea
corporis
(2
weeks)
cases
The
results
showed
that
butenafine
causes
rapid
resolution
of
signs
and
symptoms
(erythema
itching
burning
crusting
scaling
etc)
with
good
patient
and
physician
acceptability
of
treatment
The
broader
spectrum
fungicidal
activity
and
better
drug
retention
in
superficial
skin
layers
may
be
responsible
for
this
beneficial
effect
