Abstract
Text
A
study
was
undertaken
to
record
exacerbations
and
health
resource
use
in
patients
with
COPD
during
6
months
of
treatment
with
tiotropium
salmeterol
or
matching
placebos
Patients
with
COPD
were
enrolled
in
two
6-month
randomised
placebo
controlled
double
blind
double
dummy
studies
of
tiotropium
18
micro
g
once
daily
via
HandiHaler
or
salmeterol
50
micro
g
twice
daily
via
a
metered
dose
inhaler
The
two
trials
were
combined
for
analysis
of
heath
outcomes
consisting
of
exacerbations
health
resource
use
dyspnoea
(assessed
by
the
transitional
dyspnoea
index
TDI)
health
related
quality
of
life
(assessed
by
St
George's
Respiratory
Questionnaire
SGRQ)
and
spirometry
1207
patients
participated
in
the
study
(tiotropium
402
salmeterol
405
placebo
400)
Compared
with
placebo
tiotropium
but
not
salmeterol
was
associated
with
a
significant
delay
in
the
time
to
onset
of
the
first
exacerbation
Fewer
COPD
exacerbations/patient
year
occurred
in
the
tiotropium
group
(107)
than
in
the
placebo
group
(149
p<005)
the
salmeterol
group
(123
events/year)
did
not
differ
from
placebo
The
tiotropium
group
had
010
hospital
admissions
per
patient
year
for
COPD
exacerbations
compared
with
017
for
salmeterol
and
015
for
placebo
(not
statistically
different)
For
all
causes
(respiratory
and
non-respiratory)
tiotropium
but
not
salmeterol
was
associated
with
fewer
hospital
admissions
while
both
groups
had
fewer
days
in
hospital
than
the
placebo
group
The
number
of
days
during
which
patients
were
unable
to
perform
their
usual
daily
activities
was
lowest
in
the
tiotropium
group
(tiotropium
83
(08)
salmeterol
111
(08)
placebo
109
(08)

SGRQ
total
score
improved
by
42
(07)

and
15

units
during
the
6
month
trial
for
the
tiotropium
salmeterol
and
placebo
groups
respectively
(p<001
tiotropium
v
placebo)
Compared
with
placebo
TDI
focal
score
improved
in
both
the
tiotropium
group
(11
(03)
units
p<0001)
and
the
salmeterol
group
(07
(03)
units
p<005)
Evaluation
of
morning
pre-dose
FEV(1)
peak
FEV(1)
and
mean
FEV(1)
(0-3
hours)
showed
that
tiotropium
was
superior
to
salmeterol
while
both
active
drugs
were
more
effective
than
placebo
Exacerbations
of
COPD
and
health
resource
usage
were
positively
affected
by
daily
treatment
with
tiotropium
With
the
exception
of
the
number
of
hospital
days
associated
with
all
causes
salmeterol
twice
daily
resulted
in
no
significant
changes
compared
with
placebo
Tiotropium
also
improved
health
related
quality
of
life
dyspnoea
and
lung
function
in
patients
with
COPD
