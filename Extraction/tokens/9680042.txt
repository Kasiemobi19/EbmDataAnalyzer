Follow-up
on
the
treatment
of
panic
disorder
with
or
without
agoraphobia
a
quantitative
review
Abstract
Text
We
conducted
a
meta-analysis
to
update
the
knowledge
of
long-term
efficacy
of
different
treatments
in
panic
disorder
with
or
without
agoraphobia
Included
were
68
studies
pertaining
to
106
treatment
conditions
and
1346
patients
Effect
sizes
Cohen's
d
were
calculated
within
the
treatment
conditions
at
posttest
and
at
follow-up
for
panic
and
agoraphobia
A
comparison
was
made
between
six
treatments
high-potency
benzodiazepines
antidepressants
psychological
panic
management
exposure
in
vivo
antidepressants
combined
with
exposure
and
psychological
panic
management
combined
with
exposure
in
vivo
The
mean
(+/-
SD)
duration
of
the
follow-up
period
was
62
+/-
89
weeks
In
the
majority
of
the
studies
(84%)
follow-up
had
a
naturalistic
character
The
lack
of
information
about
treatments
received
between
posttest
and
follow-up
limits
the
interpretation
of
the
results
For
all
conditions
the
treatment
gains
at
posttest
were
maintained
during
the
follow-up
period
The
mean
(+/-
SD)
d
for
panic
was
111
+/-
070
at
posttest
and
128
+/-
061
at
follow-up
for
agoraphobia
the
mean
d
at
posttest
was
136
+/-
110
and
at
follow-up
it
was
141
+/-
082
Significant
differences
were
found
in
efficacy
on
agoraphobic
measures
at
follow-up
between
the
combination
of
antidepressants
and
exposure
in
vivo
versus
psychological
panic
management
exposure
in
vivo
and
the
combination
of
psychological
panic
management
and
exposure
Overall
the
data
suggest
that
different
treatment
options
for
panic
disorder
with
or
without
agoraphobia
are
effective
at
both
posttest
and
follow-up
Research
on
long-term
treatment
discontinuation
of
therapies
and
interventions
between
posttest
and
follow-up
need
more
attention
for
pharmacotherapy
as
well
as
psychotherapy
