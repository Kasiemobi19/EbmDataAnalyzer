Title
Outcome
of
surgery
for
chronic
Achilles
tendinopathy
A
critical
review
Abstract
Text
Achilles
tendinopathy
is
often
treated
surgically
after
failure
of
nonoperative
management
but
results
are
not
uniformly
excellent
We
critically
assessed
the
methods
of
26
studies
that
reported
surgical
outcomes
of
patients
with
this
condition
Using
10
previously
published
criteria
and
blinded
to
study
outcomes
we
derived
a
"methodology
score"
(0
to
100)
for
each
study
This
score
was
highly
reproducible
(r
=
099
P
<
001)
Scores
were
generally
low
concerning
the
type
of
study
subject
selection
process
and
outcome
measures
which
indicates
methods
deficiency
in
the
way
the
study
was
designed
performed
and
analyzed
We
found
a
negative
correlation
between
reported
success
rate
and
overall
methods
scores
(r
=
-053
P
<
001)
and
a
positive
correlation
between
year
of
publication
and
overall
methods
score
(r
=
070
P
<
001)
Study
methods
may
influence
reported
surgical
outcome
and
we
suggest
guidelines
for
improving
study
design
in
this
area
of
clinical
research
We
acknowledge
that
study
methods
have
improved
over
the
course
of
the
past
20
years
