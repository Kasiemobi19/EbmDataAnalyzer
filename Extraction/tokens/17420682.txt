Venlafaxine
ER
for
the
treatment
of
pediatric
subjects
with
depression
results
of
two
placebo-controlled
trials
Abstract
Text
The
safety
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
venlafaxine
extended
release
(ER)
in
subjects
ages
7
to
17
years
with
major
depressive
disorder
were
evaluated
in
two
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trials
conducted
between
October
1997
and
August
2001
Participants
received
venlafaxine
ER
(flexible
dose
based
on
body
weight
intent
to
treat
n
=
169)
or
placebo
(intent
to
treat
n
=
165)
for
up
to
8
weeks
The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
the
change
from
baseline
in
the
Children's
Depression
Rating
Scale-Revised
score
at
week
8
There
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
between
venlafaxine
ER
and
placebo
on
the
Children's
Depression
Rating
Scale-Revised
in
either
study
A
post
hoc
age
subgroup
analysis
of
the
pooled
data
showed
greater
improvement
on
the
Children's
Depression
Rating
Scale-Revised
with
venlafaxine
ER
than
with
placebo
(-244
versus
-199
p
=
022)
among
adolescents
(ages
12-17)
but
not
among
children
(ages
7-11)
The
most
common
adverse
events
were
anorexia
and
abdominal
pain
Hostility
and
suicide-related
events
were
more
common
in
venlafaxine
ER-treated
participants
than
in
placebo-treated
participants
There
were
no
completed
suicides
Venlafaxine
ER
may
be
effective
in
depressed
adolescents
However
its
safety
and
efficacy
in
pediatric
patients
has
not
been
established
Prescribers
should
monitor
for
signs
of
suicidal
ideation
and
hostility
in
pediatric
patients
taking
venlafaxine
ER
