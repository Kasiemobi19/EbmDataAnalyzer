Title
Effect
of
blood
pressure
lowering
and
antihypertensive
drug
class
on
progression
of
hypertensive
kidney
disease
results
from
the
AASK
trial
Abstract
Text
Hypertension
is
a
leading
cause
of
end-stage
renal
disease
(ESRD)
in
the
United
States
with
no
known
treatment
to
prevent
progressive
declines
leading
to
ESRD
To
compare
the
effects
of
2
levels
of
blood
pressure
(BP)
control
and
3
antihypertensive
drug
classes
on
glomerular
filtration
rate
(GFR)
decline
in
hypertension
Randomized
3
x
2
factorial
trial
with
enrollment
from
February
1995
to
September
1998
A
total
of
1094
African
Americans
aged
18
to
70
years
with
hypertensive
renal
disease
(GFR
20-65
mL/min
per
173
m(2))
were
recruited
from
21
clinical
centers
throughout
the
United
States
and
followed
up
for
3
to
64
years
Participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
1
of
2
mean
arterial
pressure
goals
102
to
107
mm
Hg
(usual
n
=
554)
or
92
mm
Hg
or
less
(lower
n
=
540)
and
to
initial
treatment
with
either
a
beta-blocker
(metoprolol
50-200
mg/d
n
=
441)
an
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
(ramipril
25-10
mg/d
n
=
436)
or
a
dihydropyridine
calcium
channel
blocker
(amlodipine
5-10
mg/d
n
=
217)
Open-label
agents
were
added
to
achieve
the
assigned
BP
goals
Rate
of
change
in
GFR
(GFR
slope)
clinical
composite
outcome
of
reduction
in
GFR
by
50%
or
more
(or
>
or
=25
mL/min
per
173
m2)
from
baseline
ESRD
or
death
Three
primary
treatment
comparisons
were
specified
lower
vs
usual
BP
goal
ramipril
vs
metoprolol
and
amlodipine
vs
metoprolol
Achieved
BP
averaged
(SD)
128/78
(12/8)
mm
Hg
in
the
lower
BP
group
and
141/85
(12/7)
mm
Hg
in
the
usual
BP
group
The
mean
(SE)
GFR
slope
from
baseline
through
4
years
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
lower
BP
group
(-221
[017]
mL/min
per
173
m2
per
year)
and
the
usual
BP
group
(-195
[017]
mL/min
per
173
m2
per
year
P
=24)
and
the
lower
BP
goal
did
not
significantly
reduce
the
rate
of
the
clinical
composite
outcome
(risk
reduction
for
lower
BP
group
=
2%
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
-22%
to
21%
P
=85)
None
of
the
drug
group
comparisons
showed
consistent
significant
differences
in
the
GFR
slope
However
compared
with
the
metoprolol
and
amlodipine
groups
the
ramipril
group
manifested
risk
reductions
in
the
clinical
composite
outcome
of
22%
(95%
CI
1%-38%
P
=04)
and
38%
(95%
CI
14%-56%
P
=004)
respectively
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
clinical
composite
outcome
between
the
amlodipine
and
metoprolol
groups
No
additional
benefit
of
slowing
progression
of
hypertensive
nephrosclerosis
was
observed
with
the
lower
BP
goal
Angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
appear
to
be
more
effective
than
beta-blockers
or
dihydropyridine
calcium
channel
blockers
in
slowing
GFR
decline
