youth
Abstract
Text
This
Task
Force
report
by
the
American
College
of
Neuropsychopharmacology
evaluates
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
(SSRIs)
antidepressants
for
depressed
youth
under
18
years
The
report
was
undertaken
after
regulatory
agencies
in
the
United
States
and
United
Kingdom
raised
concerns
in
2003
about
the
possibility
that
treatment
of
depression
in
children
and
adolescents
with
SSRIs
may
increase
the
risk
of
suicidal
thinking
or
suicide
attempts
