Title
Efficacy
of
a
mixed
amphetamine
salts
compound
in
adults
with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
Abstract
Text
We
report
on
a
controlled
trial
of
a
mixed
amphetamine
salts
compound
(Adderall
dextroamphetamine
sulfate
dextro-
levoamphetamine
sulfate
dextroamphetamine
aspartate
levoamphetamine
aspartate
and
dextroamphetamine
saccharate)
in
the
treatment
of
adult
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
This
was
a
7-week
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
crossover
study
of
Adderall
in
27
well-characterized
adults
satisfying
full
DSM-IV
criteria
for
ADHD
of
childhood
onset
and
persistent
symptoms
into
adulthood
Medication
was
titrated
up
to
30
mg
twice
a
day
Outcome
measures
included
the
ADHD
Rating
Scale
and
the
Clinical
Global
Impression
Score
Comorbid
psychiatric
disorders
were
assessed
to
test
for
potential
effects
on
treatment
outcome
Treatment
with
Adderall
at
an
average
oral
dose
of
54
mg
(administered
in
2
daily
doses)
was
effective
and
well
tolerated
Drug-specific
improvement
in
ADHD
symptoms
was
highly
significant
overall
(42%
decrease
on
the
ADHD
Rating
Scale
P<001)
and
sufficiently
robust
to
be
detectable
in
a
parallel
groups
comparison
restricted
to
the
first
3
weeks
of
the
protocol
(P<001)
The
percentage
of
subjects
who
improved
(reduction
in
the
ADHD
rating
scale
of
>
or
=30%)
was
significantly
higher
with
Adderall
treatment
than
with
a
placebo
(70%
vs
7%
P
=001)
Adderall
was
effective
and
well
tolerated
in
the
short-term
treatment
of
adults
with
ADHD
More
work
is
needed
to
evaluate
the
long-term
effects
of
Adderall
or
other
amphetamine
compounds
in
the
treatment
of
adults
with
ADHD
