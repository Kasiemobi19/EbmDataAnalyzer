Regular
sugar-sweetened
beverage
consumption
between
meals
increases
risk
of
overweight
among
preschool-aged
children
Abstract
Text
To
examine
the
relationship
between
consumption
of
sugar-sweetened
beverages
(eg
nondiet
carbonated
drinks
and
fruit
drinks)
and
the
prevalence
of
overweight
among
preschool-aged
children
living
in
Canada
Data
come
from
the
Longitudinal
Study
of
Child
Development
in
Québec
(1998-2002)
A
representative
sample
(n=2103)
of
children
born
in
1998
in
Québec
Canada
A
total
of
1944
children
(still
representative
of
the
same-age
children
in
this
population)
remaining
at
4
to
5
years
in
2002
participated
in
the
nutrition
study
Data
were
collected
via
24-hour
dietary
recall
interview
Frequency
of
sugar-sweetened
beverage
consumption
between
meals
at
age
25
35
and
45
years
was
recorded
and
children's
height
and
weight
were
measured
Multivariate
regression
analysis
was
done
with
Statistical
Analysis
System
software
Weighted
data
were
adjusted
for
within-child
variability
and
significance
level
was
set
at
5%
Overall
69%
of
children
who
were
nonconsumers
of
sugar-sweetened
beverages
between
meals
between
the
ages
of
25
to
45
years
were
overweight
at
45
years
compared
to
154%
of
regular
consumers
(four
to
six
times
or
more
per
week)
at
ages
25
years
35
years
and
45
years
According
to
multivariate
analysis
sugar-sweetened
beverage
consumption
between
meals
more
than
doubles
the
odds
of
being
overweight
when
other
important
factors
are
considered
in
multivariate
analysis
Children
from
families
with
insufficient
income
who
consume
sugar-sweetened
beverages
regularly
between
the
ages
of
25
and
45
years
are
more
than
three
times
more
likely
to
be
overweight
at
age
45
years
compared
to
nonconsuming
children
from
sufficient
income
households
Regular
sugar-sweetened
beverage
consumption
between
meals
may
put
some
young
children
at
a
greater
risk
for
overweight
Parents
should
limit
the
quantity
of
sweetened
beverages
consumed
during
preschool
years
because
it
may
increase
propensity
to
gain
weight
