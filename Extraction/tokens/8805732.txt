A
randomized

trial
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
effect
of
white
petrolatum
vs
bacitracin
ointment
on
wound
infection
incidence
allergic
contact
dermatitis
incidence
and
healing
characteristics
Randomized
double-blind
prospective
trial
comparing
white
petrolatum
with
bacitracin
ointment
in
postprocedure
wound
care
A
general
outpatient
dermatology
clinic
and
a
tertiary
referral
advanced
surgical
procedure
clinic
at
Walter
Reed
Army
Medical
Center
Washington
DC
A
total
of
922
patients
who
had
dermatologic
surgery
with
a
total
of
1249
wounds
The
incidence
of
infection
and
allergic
contact
dermatitis
during
a
follow-up
period
of
4
weeks
Healing
characteristics
were
secondary
outcomes
Of
the
922
patients
enrolled
440
in
the
white
petrolatum
group
and
444
in
the
bacitracin
group
were
evaluable
for
clinical
response
The
2
treatment
groups
had
comparable
baseline
characteristics
Thirteen
patients
developed
postprocedure
infection
(15%)
9
(20%)
in
the
white
petrolatum
group
vs
4
(09%)
in
the
bacitracin
group
(95%
confidence
interval
for
difference
-04%
to
27%
P=37)
Eight
infections
(18%)
in
the
white
petrolatum
group
were
due
to
Staphylococcus
aureus
vs
none
in
the
bacitracin
group
(P=004)
No
patient
in
the
group
using
white
petrolatum
developed
allergic
contact
dermatitis
vs
4
patients
(09%)
in
the
group
using
bacitracin
(P=12)
Additionally
there
were
no
clinically
significant
differences
in
healing
between
the
treatment
groups
on
day
1
(P=98)
day
7
(P=86)
or
day
28
(P=28)
after
the
procedure
White
petrolatum
is
a
safe
effective
wound
care
ointment
for
ambulatory
surgery
In
comparison
with
bacitracin
white
petrolatum
possesses
an
equally
low
infection
rate
and
minimal
risk
for
induction
of
allergy
