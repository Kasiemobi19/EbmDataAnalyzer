Development
of
guidelines
for
idiopathic
normal-pressure
hydrocephalus
introduction
Abstract
Text
There
are
no
currently
accepted
evidence-based
guidelines
for
the
diagnosis
and
management
of
the
normal-pressure
hydrocephalus
(NPH)
patient
As
a
result
an
independent
study
group
was
assembled
to
address
this
issue
and
determine
the
feasibility
of
developing
standardized
guidelines
which
would
be
acceptable
in
the
United
States
and
abroad
and
would
be
based
on
the
available
scientific
evidence
The
guidelines
were
to
encompass
value
of
clinical
presentation
value
of
supplementary
diagnostic
tests
surgical
management
and
outcome
assessment
Initially
a
series
of
10
questions
were
formulated
in
the
areas
of
pathophysiology
diagnosis
and
treatment
to
obtain
a
consensus
by
panels
of
experts
(see
Acknowledgments)
assembled
in
San
Antonio
TX
in
September
2000
This
workshop
provided
significant
insight
into
the
difficulties
in
developing
NPH
guidelines
and
a
consensus
was
reached
as
to
those
questions
involving
expert
opinion
Subsequently
evidentiary
tables
were
developed
on
the
basis
of
the
available
evidence
Only
those
studies
with
20
or
more
idiopathic
NPH
(INPH)
patients
were
included
Sensitivity
specificity
and
positive
and
negative
predictive
values
for
INPH
diagnostic
criteria
were
assessed
and
guidelines
were
developed
on
the
basis
of
the
available
evidence
Recommendations
for
classification
of
INPH
and
additional
studies
were
documented
The
development
of
the
guidelines
was
made
difficult
because
systematic
studies
of
INPH
and
patient
numbers
were
few
It
was
decided
to
maintain
the
classification
of
NPH
into
two
major
categories
INPH
and
those
of
known
cause
(secondary
NPH)
Many
studies
"mixed"
these
classifications
and
as
a
result
they
could
not
be
used
in
the
evidentiary
tables
Despite
these
problems
evidence-based
guidelines
were
developed
and
it
is
hoped
that
they
will
be
useful
in
guiding
clinical
management
of
the
INPH
patient
