Creatine
kinase
isoenzyme
activities
in
men
and
women
following
a
marathon
race
Abstract
Text
Serum
samples
from
14
men
and
8
women
were
obtained
pre-marathon
(48
h)
and
at
24
48
72
and
96
h
post-race
to
quantitate
total
serum
creatine
kinase
activity
(TCK)
percentage
of
creatine
kinase
MB
(CK-MB)
and
clearance
rates
(half-lives)
of
TCK
and
CK-MB
TCK
was
measured
enzymatically
and
the
CK-MB
isoenzyme
was
separated
by
agarose
electrophoresis
and
quantitated
by
densitometry
The
men's
and
women's
post-race
mean
TCK
levels
were
significantly
elevated
(P
less
than
005)
above
pre-race
values
at
24
h
(3322
U

l-1
946
U

l-1
and
48
h
(1787
U

l-1
508
U

l-1)
In
addition
CK-MB
was
significantly
elevated
both
24
h
(51%
33%)
and
48
h
(25%
18%)
post-race
(P
less
than
005)
The
men's
24-h
TCK
was
223
times
the
pre-race
value
while
the
women
had
an
86-fold
increase
in
TCK
The
mean
24-h
post-race
CK-MB
activities
were
166
U

l-1
for
the
men
and
31
U

l-1
for
the
women
The
mean
increase
in
CK-MB
activity
was
415-fold
for
the
men
and
78-fold
for
the
women
Furthermore
the
men
had
a
mean
half-life
(t1/2)
of
304
h
for
TCK
and
120
h
for
CK-MB
the
women's
t1/2's
were
294
and
168
h
respectively
At
all
time
points
the
men
evidenced
significantly
(P
less
than
005)
higher
TCK
and
CK-MB
enzyme
activities
than
did
the
women(ABSTRACT
