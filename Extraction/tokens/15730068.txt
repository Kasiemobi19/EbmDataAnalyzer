Comparison

the
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
scale
versus
the
clinician-administered
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
scale
in
domestic
violence
survivors
Abstract
Text
The
posttraumatic
diagnostic
scale
(PDS)
is
a
self-report
instrument
for
PTSD
that
is
simple
to
administer
and
has
demonstrated
good
psychometric
properties
We
compared
the
PDS
with
the
gold
standard
clinician
administered
PTSD
scale
(CAPS)
diagnostic
interview
for
PTSD
We
assessed
138
women
who
were
victims
of
domestic
violence
using
both
the
PDS
and
the
CAPS
Findings
confirmed
that
PTSD
develops
at
a
high
base
rate
in
this
sample
The
PDS
generally
performed
well
in
relation
to
the
CAPS
although
with
a
tendency
to
overdiagnose
PTSD
The
findings
lend
further
support
to
the
use
of
the
PDS
as
a
diagnostic
tool
for
PTSD
but
indicate
that
it
is
better
at
identifying
survivors
with
PTSD
than
those
without
the
disorder
