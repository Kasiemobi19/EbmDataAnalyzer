Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
short-term
impact
of
smoking
and
smoking
cessation
measured
by
self-report
and
by
serum
cotinine
on
the
risk
of
secondary
cardiovascular
disease
events
(CVD
events)
Cohort
study
among
participants
of
an
in-patient
3-week
rehabilitation
programme
following
an
acute
coronary
syndrome
or
coronary
artery
revascularization
Smoking
status
at
baseline
was
assessed
by
self-report
(beginning
of
the
rehabilitation
programme
rehab)
and
serum
cotinine
(end
of
rehab)
Active
follow-up
was
conducted
one
year
later
Subsequent
CVD
events
were
observed
in
139
of
the
967
patients
Both
self-reported
smoking
status
(odds
ratio
(OR)
compared
to
continued
smokers
recent
quitters

and
serum
cotinine
(OR
059
(95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
036-097)
for
cotinine-negative
compared
to
cotinine-positive
subjects)
were
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
a
secondary
CVD
event
After
reclassification
of
all
cotinine-positive
subjects
to
continued
smokers
and
cotinine-negative
self-reported
smokers
to
recent
quitters
this
association
became
even
stronger
The
OR
now
reached
071
(95%
CI
interval
038-133)
for
recent
quitters
064
(036-111)
for
former
smokers
and
044
(024-081)
for
never
smokers
(p-value
for
trend=0009)
The
benefits
of
non-smoking
and
smoking
cessation
in
cardiac
patients
are
beyond
controversy
and
might
even
be
larger
than
suggested
by
previous
studies
which
exclusively
relied
on
self-reported
smoking
status
