changes
after
loss
of
massive
excess
weight
following
bariatric
surgery
Abstract
Text
A
clinical
study
was
undertaken
to
assess
gynecologic-obstetric
changes
in
morbidly
obese
women
who
lost
greater
than
or
equal
to
50%
of
their
excess
weight
with
bariatric
surgery
The
138
females
(109
of
reproductive
age)
age
35
+/-
9
SD
yr
weighed
124
+/-
23
kg
before
surgery
and
79
+/-
13
kg
after
weight
loss
had
stabilized
Menstrual
irregularities
were
present
in
404%
of
premenopausal
patients
preoperatively
after
massive
weight
loss
cycles
were
abnormal
in
46%
(p
less
than
0001)
Infertility
problems
were
present
preoperatively
in
293%
Of
these
nine
tried
to
conceive
after
weight
loss
and
were
successful
During
past
pregnancies
medical
complications
were
frequent
(hypertension
267%
pre-eclampsia
128%
diabetes
70%
and
deep
vein
thrombosis
70%)
After
weight-loss
stabilization
these
obstetric
complications
did
not
occur
Incidence
of
urinary
stress
incontinence
decreased
from
612%
to
116%
(p
less
than
0001)
Gynecologic-obstetric
changes
tended
to
normalize
after
loss
of
massive
body
weight
