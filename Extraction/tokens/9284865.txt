Abstract
Text
To
compare
short-term
efficacy
of
benzodiazepines
antidepressants
psychological
panic
management
exposure
in
vivo
and
combination
treatments
in
panic
disorder
with
or
without
agoraphobia
(PA)
a
meta-analysis
was
conducted
Included
were
106
studies
pertaining
to
222
treatment
conditions
5011
patients
at
pretest
and
4016
at
posttest
Pre/post
effect
sizes
Cohen's
d
were
calculated
within
the
treatment
conditions
for
four
clinical
variables
panic
agoraphobia
depression
and
general
anxiety
Seven
large
treatment
conditions
were
used
in
the
main
analyses
high-potency
benzodiazepines
antidepressants
psychological
panic
management
exposure
in
vivo
pill-placebo
combined
with
exposure
antidepressants
combined
with
exposure
and
psychological
panic
management
combined
with
exposure
in
vivo
First
these
treatments
were
compared
with
a
control
condition
consisting
of
pill-placebo
attention
placebo
and
waiting
list
Next
a
comparison
was
made
between
the
treatments
Antidepressants
psychological
panic
management
high-potency
benzodiazepines
and
antidepressants
combined
with
exposure
in
vivo
were
superior
to
the
control
condition
for
panic
attacks
Exposure
in
vivo
alone
was
not
effective
for
panic
attacks
With
regard
to
agoraphobic
avoidance
all
seven
treatments
were
superior
to
the
control
condition
When
comparing
the
various
treatment
conditions
no
differences
concerning
panic
attacks
were
found
For
agoraphobic
avoidance
the
combination
of
antidepressants
with
exposure
in
vivo
was
superior
to
the
other
conditions
The
combination
of
antidepressants
with
exposure
in
vivo
is
the
most
potent
short-term
treatment
of
PA
