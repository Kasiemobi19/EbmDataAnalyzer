Is
sugar-sweetened
beverage
consumption
associated
with
increased
fatness
in
children
Abstract
Text
We
assessed
whether
sugar-sweetened
beverage
(SSB)
consumption
increases
fatness
in
British
children
Data
from
a
subsample
of
the
Avon
Longitudinal
Study
of
Parents
and
Children
were
analyzed
Diet
was
assessed
at
ages
5
y
(n
=
521)
and
7
y
(n
=
682)
using
3-d
diet
diaries
Beverages
were
categorized
into
SSB
low
energy
fruit
juice
milk
and
water
Fat
mass
was
measured
at
age
9
y
using
dual-energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
The
association
between
consumption
of
SSB
at
each
age
and
fatness
was
examined
using
linear
regression
adjusted
for
potentially
confounding
variables
SSB
accounted
for
15%
of
all
drinks
consumed
and
3%
of
total
energy
intake
at
both
ages
There
was
no
evidence
of
an
association
between
SSB
consumption
at
5
or
7
y
of
age
and
fatness
at
age
9
y
There
was
a
small
positive
correlation
between
low-energy
drinks
at
age
5
and
7
y
and
fatness
at
9
y
(age
5
y
rho
=
021
P
<
0001
age
7
y
rho
=
016
P
<
0001)
which
was
explained
by
existing
overweight
status
at
ages
5
and
7
y
In
this
cohort
of
British
children
there
was
no
evidence
of
an
association
between
SSB
consumption
at
age
5
or
7
y
and
fatness
at
age
9
y
The
positive
relation
between
consumption
of
low-energy
beverages
and
fatness
at
9
y
which
was
explained
by
overweight
status
at
5
and
7
y
suggests
that
heavier
children
may
consume
low-energy
beverages
as
part
of
an
ineffective
weight-control
program
