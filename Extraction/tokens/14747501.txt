Effect
of
breast
augmentation
on
the
accuracy
of
mammography
and
cancer
characteristics
Abstract
Text
Breast
augmentation
is
not
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
breast
cancer
however
implants
may
interfere
with
the
detection
of
breast
cancer
thereby
delaying
cancer
diagnosis
in
women
with
augmentation
To
determine
whether
mammography
accuracy
and
tumor
characteristics
are
different
for
women
with
and
without
augmentation
A
prospective
cohort
of
137
women
with
augmentation
and
685
women
without
augmentation
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
between
January
1
1995
and
October
15
2002
matched
(15)
by
age
race/ethnicity
previous
mammography
screening
and
mammography
registry
and
10
533
women
with
augmentation
and
974
915
women
without
augmentation
and
without
breast
cancer
among
7
mammography
registries
in
Denver
Colo
Lebanon
NH
Albuquerque
NM
Chapel
Hill
NC
San
Francisco
Calif
Seattle
Wash
and
Burlington
Vt
Comparison
between
women
with
and
without
augmentation
of
mammography
performance
measures
and
cancer
characteristics
including
invasive
carcinoma
or
ductal
carcinoma
in
situ
tumor
stage
nodal
status
size
grade
and
estrogen-receptor
status
Among
asymptomatic
women
the
sensitivity
of
screening
mammography
based
on
the
final
assessment
was
lower
in
women
with
breast
augmentation
vs
women
without
(450%
[95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
293%-615%]
vs
668%
[95%
CI
604%-728%]
P
=008)
and
specificity
was
slightly
higher
in
women
with
augmentation
(977%
[95%
CI
974%-980%]
vs
967%
[95%
CI
966%-967%]
P<001)
Among
symptomatic
women
both
sensitivity
and
specificity
were
lower
for
women
with
augmentation
compared
with
women
without
but
these
differences
were
not
significant
Tumors
were
of
similar
stage
size
estrogen-receptor
status
and
nodal
status
but
tended
to
be
lower
grade
(P
=052)
for
women
with
breast
augmentation
vs
without
Breast
augmentation
decreases
the
sensitivity
of
screening
mammography
among
asymptomatic
women
but
does
not
increase
the
false-positive
rate
Despite
the
lower
accuracy
of
mammography
in
women
with
augmentation
the
prognostic
characteristics
of
tumors
are
not
influenced
by
augmentation
