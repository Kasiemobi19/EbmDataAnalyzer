The
prevalence
and
severity
of
fluorosis
and
other
developmental
defects
of
enamel
in
children
who
received
free
fluoride
toothpaste
containing
either
440

1450
ppm

Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
impact
of
a
programme
regularly
supplying
free
fluoride
toothpaste
to
children
on
the
prevalence
and
severity
of
fluorosis
and
other
developmental
defects
of
enamel
Randomised
controlled
parallel
three-group
clinical
trial
Two
groups
received
toothpaste
containing
either
440
or
1450
ppm
F
the
third
group
received
no
intervention
Children
were
supplied
with
toothpaste
and
advice
on
its
use
from
the
age
of
12
months
until
they
were
5-6
years
old
The
participants
were
a
sub
sample
of
those
involved
in
a
study
that
considered
the
caries
benefits
of
providing
free
fluoride
toothpaste
They
were
eligible
if
they
completed
the
main
study
lived
in
four
of
the
nine
districts
involved
and
attended
schools
with
6
or
more
eligible
participants
Children
from
the
north
west
of
England
consuming
drinking
water
containing
less
than
01
ppm
F
were
examined
in
primary
schools
3731
children
completed
the
main
study
Of
the
1833
children
in
the
four
selected
districts
927
were
from
schools
with
six
or
more
participants
Digital
images
encompassing
the
upper
and
lower
anterior
sextants
were
taken
of
each
child
when
they
were
8-9
years
old
Developmental
defects
of
enamel
and
dental
fluorosis
(TF
index)
were
recorded
on
upper
central
incisors
from
wet
and
dry
images
A
total
of
703
children
were
included
in
the
data
analysis
In
the
1450
ppm
F
(n=218)
440
ppm
F
(n
=
226)
and
control
(n
=
259)
groups
the
prevalence
of
dental
fluorosis
(TF
>
0)
was
17%
15%
and
12%
for
the
wet
(p
>
005)
and
26%
24%
and
25%
for
the
dry
(p
>
005)
photographs
respectively
The
prevalence
of
TF
scores
2
or
3
(highest
score)
was
5%
4%
and
2%
and
for
the
wet
(p
>
005)
and
7%
4%
and
5%
for
the
dry
(p
>
005)
photographs
respectively
All
subjects
identified
with
TF
score
3
were
found
in
the
group
using
the
1450
ppm
F
toothpaste
(3
wet
and
4
dry)
and
there
were
statistically
significant
differences
between
the
three
groups
for
both
wet
(p
=
003)
and
dry
photographs
(p
<
001)
However
the
pairwise
comparisons
between
the
groups
failed
to
attain
statistical
significance
The
highest
prevalence
and
severity
of
demarcated
opacities
was
seen
in
the
control
group
and
for
the
wet
photographs
the
difference
between
the
three
groups
attained
statistical
significance
(p
=
004)
For
both
the
wet
and
dry
photographs
the
prevalence
of
any
enamel
defects
(including
fluorosis)
and
large
demarcated
or
TF
score
3
was
similar
for
the
three
groups
(p
>
005)
Previously
it
has
been
reported
that
only
the
provision
of
1450
ppm
F
toothpaste
provides
anticaries
benefits
in
a
programme
of
this
type
This
benefit
is
accompanied
by
a
slight
increase
in
prevalence
of
TF
score
3
but
not
the
overall
prevalence
of
developmental
defects
of
enamel
Careful
targeting
and
implementation
of
a
programme
of
this
type
is
required
to
maximise
benefits
and
minimise
risks
of
fluoride
exposure
