Comparing
the
diagnostic
accuracy
of
six
potential
screening
instruments
for
bipolar
disorder
in
youths
aged
5
to
17
years
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
diagnostic
efficiency
of
six
index
tests
as
predictors
of
juvenile
bipolar
disorder
in
two
large
outpatient
samples
aged
5
to
10
and
11
to
17
years
gathered
from
1997
to
2002
DSM-IV
diagnosis
was
based
on
a
semistructured
diagnostic
interview
(Schedule
for
Affective
Disorders
and
Schizophrenia
for
School-Age
Children)
with
the
parent
and
youth
sequentially
blind
to
scores
on
the
index
tests
Participants
were
318
youths
aged
5
to
10
(50%
with
bipolar
diagnoses)
and
324
youths
aged
11
to
17
(41%
with
bipolar
diagnoses)
Areas
under
the
curve
(AUCs)
from
receiver
operating
characteristic
analyses
and
multilevel
likelihood
ratios
quantified
test
performance
Parent
report
(AUCs
from
078
to
084
in
both
age
groups)
outperformed
teacher
(AUCs
057
in
the
younger
sample
and
070
in
the
older
sample)
or
adolescent
measures
(AUCs
067
[General
Behavior
Inventory]
and
071
[Youth
Self-Report])
at
identifying
bipolar
disorders
Combining
tests
did
not
produce
clinically
meaningful
classification
improvement
Parent
report
was
more
useful
than
teacher
report
or
adolescent
self-report
on
the
index
tests
studied
Results
generally
replicated
across
both
age
groups
Parent
report
on
these
instruments
could
facilitate
differential
diagnosis
of
bipolar
disorder
in
youths
aged
5
to
17
years
especially
by
decreasing
the
rate
of
false-positive
diagnoses
