The
effectiveness
of
topically
applied
capsaicin
A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
To
undertake
a
quantitative
overview
of
trials
of
topical
capsaicin
for
the
treatment
of
diabetic
neuropathy
osteoarthritis
post-herpetic
neuralgia
and
psoriasis
A
systematic
search
of
the
literature
using
both
computerized
and
manual
methods
for
identifying
clinical
trials
of
capsaicin
The
trials
identified
were
abstracted
for
response
data
which
then
were
analysed
using
established
meta-analytic
methods
for
both
fixed
and
random
effects
modelling
The
odds
ratio
of
the
response
rate
of
subjects
receiving
topical
capsaicin
relative
to
that
of
subjects
on
placebo
was
used
as
the
main
outcome
measure
The
difference
in
the
response
rate
was
used
as
the
response
variable
under
the
random
effects
model
When
dropouts
were
mentioned
and
unambiguous
assignment
could
not
be
made
the
analysis
was
made
on
the
basis
of
intention
to
treat
Capsaicin
cream
give
more
pain
relief
to
patients
with
diabetic
neuropathy
than
placebo
did
The
odds
ratio

and

in
favour
of
capsaicin
cream
were

Using
a
random
effect
model
the
rate
difference
(RD)
in
favour
of
capsaicin
cream
was
RD

(95%
CI

Capsaicin
cream
was
also
better
than
placebo
in
providing
pain
relief
in
osteoarthritis
OR
=
436
(95%
CI
=
277
688)
and
RD
=

(95%
CI

and
in
psoriasis
OR
=
280
(95%
CI
=
169
462)
and
RD
=
035
(95%
CI
=
014
056)
There
was
however
evidence
of
heterogeneity
in
the
individual
RDs
in
psoriasis
and
complete
binding
was
difficulty
because
of
the
initial
discomfort
associated
with
topical
capsaicin(ABSTRACT
