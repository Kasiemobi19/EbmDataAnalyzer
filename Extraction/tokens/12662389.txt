Title
Co-infection
with
gonorrhoea
and
chlamydia
how
much
is
there
and
what
does
it
mean
Abstract
Text
A
cross-sectional
study
of
new
clients
with
either
gonorrhoea
or
chlamydia
attending
King's
College
Hospital
in
1998
One
thousand
two
hundred
and
thirty-nine
women
and
1141
men
had
gonorrhoea
chlamydia
or
both
Overall
242%
(124/512)
of
heterosexual
men
and
385%
(136/353)
of
women
with
gonorrhoea
also
had
chlamydia
(P<0001)
Of
heterosexual
males
188%
(124/660)
and
13%
(136/1022)
of
females
with
chlamydia
also
had
gonorrhoea
(P=0002)
Ethnicity
had
no
effect
on
the
proportion
of
co-infection
after
controlling
for
age
and
gender
Clients
with
dual
infection
were
younger
than
those
with
either
infection
alone
(P=00001)
Over
half
of
women
and
a
quarter
of
men
aged
15
to
19
years
were
dually
infected
so
testing
for
both
gonorrhoea
and
chlamydia
may
be
appropriate
in
this
age
group
in
settings
outside
genitourinary
clinics
The
high
proportion
of
cases
of
gonorrhoea
that
also
have
chlamydia
justifies
the
policy
of
epidemiological
treatment
for
chlamydia
