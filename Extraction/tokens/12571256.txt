Nephrotoxic
effects
in
high-risk
patients
undergoing
angiography
Abstract
Text
The
use
of
iodinated
contrast
medium
can
result
in
nephropathy
Whether
iso-osmolar
contrast
medium
is
less
nephrotoxic
than
low-osmolar
contrast
medium
in
high-risk
patients
is
uncertain
We
conducted
a
randomized
double-blind
prospective
multicenter
study
comparing
the
nephrotoxic
effects
of
an
iso-osmolar
dimeric
nonionic
contrast
medium
iodixanol
with
those
of
a
low-osmolar
nonionic
monomeric
contrast
medium
iohexol
The
study
involved
129
patients
with
diabetes
with
serum
creatinine
concentrations
of
15
to
35
mg
per
deciliter
who
underwent
coronary
or
aortofemoral
angiography
The
primary
end
point
was
the
peak
increase
from
base
line
in
the
creatinine
concentration
during
the
three
days
after
angiography
Other
end
points
were
an
increase
in
the
creatinine
concentration
of
05
mg
per
deciliter
or
more
an
increase
of
10
mg
per
deciliter
or
more
and
a
change
in
the
creatinine
concentration
from
day
0
to
day
7
The
creatinine
concentration
increased
significantly
less
in
patients
who
received
iodixanol
From
day
0
to
day
3
the
mean
peak
increase
in
creatinine
was
013
mg
per
deciliter
in
the
iodixanol
group
and
055
mg
per
deciliter
in
the
iohexol
group
(P=0001
the
increase
with
iodixanol
minus
the
increase
with
iohexol
-042
mg
per
deciliter
[95
percent
confidence
interval
-073
to
-022])
Two
of
the
64
patients
in
the
iodixanol
group
(3
percent)
had
an
increase
in
the
creatinine
concentration
of
05
mg
per
deciliter
or
more
as
compared
with
17
of
the
65
patients
in
the
iohexol
group
(26
percent)
(P=0002
odds
ratio
for
such
an
increase
in
the
iodixanol
group
009
[95
percent
confidence
interval
002
to
041])
No
patient
receiving
iodixanol
had
an
increase
of
10
mg
per
deciliter
or
more
but
10
patients
in
the
iohexol
group
(15
percent)
did
The
mean
change
in
the
creatinine
concentration
from
day
0
to
day
7
was
007
mg
per
deciliter
in
the
iodixanol
group
and
024
mg
per
deciliter
in
the
iohexol
group
(P=0003
value
in
the
iodixanol
group
minus
the
value
in
the
iohexol
group
-017
mg
per
deciliter
[95
percent
confidence
interval
-034
to
-007])
Nephropathy
induced
by
contrast
medium
may
be
less
likely
to
develop
in
high-risk
patients
when
iodixanol
is
used
rather
than
a
low-osmolar
nonionic
contrast
medium
