Hyperbilirubinemia
in
the
breast-fed
newborn
a
controlled
trial
of
four
interventions
Abstract
Text
A
controlled
clinical
trial
was
conducted
to
compare
the
effect
of
four
different
interventions
on
hyperbilirubinemia
in
125
full-term
breast-fed
infants
Of
1685
term
infants
who
met
the
inclusion
criteria
126
(74%)
had
a
serum
bilirubin
concentration
>
or
=
291
mumol/L
(17
mg/dL)
When
the
bilirubin
reached
this
level
babies
were
assigned
at
random
to
one
of
four
interventions
(1)
continue
breast-feeding
and
observe
(2)
discontinue
breast-feeding
substitute
formula
(3)
discontinue
breast-feeding
substitute
formula
and
administer
phototherapy
(4)
continue
breast-feeding
administer
phototherapy
The
serum
bilirubin
concentration
reached
342
mumol/L
(20
mg/dL)
in
24%
of
infants
in
group
1
19%
in
group
2
3%
in
group
3
and
14%
in
group
4
When
phototherapy
was
used
the
decline
in
serum
bilirubin
was
significantly
larger
and
more
rapid
(compared
with
no
phototherapy)
In
the
majority
of
breast-fed
infants
whose
serum
bilirubin
levels
reach
291
mumol/L
(17
mg/dL)
the
bilirubin
will
decline
spontaneously
and
will
not
reach
342
mumol/L
(20
mg/dL)
If
the
infant
is
significantly
jaundiced
and
a
decision
is
made
to
intervene
parents
can
be
given
a
number
of
options
and
can
make
an
informed
decision
regarding
which
if
any
intervention
they
prefer
