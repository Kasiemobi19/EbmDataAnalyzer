Abstract
Text
Many
expert
panels
recommend
colorectal
cancer
screening
for
average-risk
asymptomatic
individuals
older
than
50
years
of
age
Recent
studies
have
found
that
24%
to
64%
of
primary
care
providers
use
only
the
digital
fecal
occult
blood
test
(FOBT)
as
their
primary
screening
test
The
effectiveness
of
a
single
digital
FOBT
is
unknown
To
compare
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
digital
FOBT
and
the
recommended
6-sample
at-home
FOBT
for
advanced
neoplasia
in
asymptomatic
persons
Prospective
cohort
study
13
Veterans
Affairs
medical
centers
3121
asymptomatic
patients
50
to
75
years
of
age
2665
patients
had
6-sample
at-home
FOBT
and
digital
FOBT
followed
by
complete
colonoscopy
We
measured
the
sensitivity
of
digital
and
6-sample
FOBT
for
advanced
neoplasia
and
the
specificity
for
no
neoplasia
We
calculated
predictive
values
and
likelihood
ratios
for
advanced
neoplasia
defined
as
tubular
adenomas
10
mm
or
greater
adenomas
with
villous
histology
or
high-grade
dysplasia
or
invasive
cancer
Of
all
participants
968%
were
men
their
average
age
was
631
years
The
6-sample
FOBT
and
the
single
digital
FOBT
had
specificities
of
939%
and
975%
respectively
as
defined
by
studying
1656
patients
with
no
neoplasia
Sensitivities
for
detection
of
advanced
neoplasia
in
284
patients
were
239%
for
the
6-sample
FOBT
and
49%
for
the
digital
FOBT
The
likelihood
ratio
for
advanced
neoplasia
was
168
(95%
CI
096
to
294)
for
positive
results
on
digital
FOBT
and
098
(CI
095
to
101)
for
negative
results
Most
patients
were
men
Single
digital
FOBT
is
a
poor
screening
method
for
colorectal
neoplasia
and
cannot
be
recommended
as
the
only
test
When
digital
FOBT
is
performed
as
part
of
a
primary
care
physical
examination
negative
results
do
not
decrease
the
odds
of
advanced
neoplasia
Persons
with
these
results
should
be
offered
at-home
6-sample
FOBT
or
another
type
of
screening
test
