Abstract
Text
Pyogenic
granuloma
is
a
common
acquired
benign
vascular
lesion
of
skin
and
mucous
membranes
which
may
occasionally
present
intravascularly
or
subcutaneously
Pyogenic
granuloma
occur
in
all
age
groups
and
although
they
may
eventually
regress
removal
of
unsightly
bleeding
or
uncomfortably
positioned
lesions
is
usually
sought
before
this
takes
place
This
is
a
retrospective
study
of
408
cases
of
pyogenic
granuloma
that
were
analysed
by
the
Stoke
Mandeville
Histopathology
laboratory
between
1994
and
2004
This
study
was
carried
out
to
review
the
sex
age
and
anatomic
distribution
of
the
lesions
and
to
assess
the
most
successful
form
of
treatment
on
the
basis
of
recurrence
risk
and
other
measures
such
as
aesthetic
result
acceptability
and
appropriateness
of
the
procedure
with
respect
to
the
patient
There
was
a
slight
male
preponderance
especially
among
children
The
exception
to
this
was
lesions
on
mucous
membranes
which
were
more
common
in
women
Head
and
neck
was
the
most
common
anatomical
location
in
particular
the
cheek
and
intraoral
locations
Fewest
recurrences
were
noted
following
excision
and
direct
closure
although
all
techniques
investigated
showed
an
acceptably
low
recurrence
rate
Whatever
technique
is
used
it
must
yield
material
for
histopathological
analysis
to
ensure
the
exclusion
of
differential
diagnoses
