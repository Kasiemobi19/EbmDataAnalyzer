Title
Antidepressant
plus
benzodiazepine
for
major
depression
Abstract
Text
Anxiety
frequently
coexists
with
depression
Adding
benzodiazepines
to
antidepressants
is
commonly
used
to
treat
people
with
depression
although
there
has
been
no
convincing
evidence
to
show
that
such
a
combination
is
more
effective
than
antidepressants
alone
and
that
there
are
suggestions
that
benzodiazepines
may
lose
their
efficacy
with
long-term
administration
and
that
their
chronic
use
carries
risks
of
dependenceTo
determine
whether
among
adult
patients
with
major
depression
adding
benzodiazepines
to
antidepressants
brings
about
any
benefit
in
terms
of
symptomatic
recovery
or
side-effects
in
the
short
term
(less
than
8
weeks)
and
long
term
(more
than
2
months)
in
comparison
with
treatment
by
antidepressants
aloneWe

Two

examined
the
effect
of

as

the

Three
a

analyses
were
performed
with

the
patients
with

without

anxiety

with

to

nine
studies

than
the
antidepressant

group
(relative

049
to
081)
The
intention-to-treat
analysis
(with
people
dropping
out
assigned
the
least
favourable
outcome)
showed
that
the
combination
group
was
more
likely
to
show
improvement
in
their
depression
(defined
as
50%
or
greater
reduction
in
the
depression
scale
from
baseline)
(relative

to

at
one
week
and
relative
risk
138
95%
confidence
interval
115
to
166
at
four
weeks)
The
difference
was
no
longer
significant
at
six
to
eight
weeks
None
of
the
included
RCTs
lasted
longer
than
eight
weeks
The
patients
allocated
to
the
combination
therapy
were
less
likely
to
drop
out
from
the
treatment
due
to
side
effects
than
those
receiving
antidepressants
alone
(relative
risk
053
95%
confidence
interval
032
to
086)
However
these
two
groups
of
patients
were
equally
likely
to
report
at
least
one
side
effect
(relative
risk

to
107)The
potential
benefits
of
adding
a
benzodiazepine
to
an
antidepressant
must
be
balanced
judiciously
against
possible
harms
including
development
of
dependence
and
accident
proneness
on
the
one
hand
and
against
continued
suffering
following
