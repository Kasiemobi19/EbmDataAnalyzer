examination

is

Abstract
Text
This
study
revisited
the
ultrasonographic
diagnostic
criteria
of
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS)
and
studied
the
relationship
between
the
major
hormonal
and
metabolic
features
of
PCOS
and
the
follicle
number
per
ovary
(FNPO)
This
prospective
study
included
214
women
with
PCOS
compared
with
112
women
with
normal
ovaries
Main
clinical
biological
and
ultrasonographic
markers
of
PCOS
were
assessed
during
the
early
follicular
phase
The
mean
FNPO
of
follicles
2-5
mm
in
size
was
significantly
higher
in
polycystic
ovaries
than
in
controls
while
it
was
similar
within
the
6-9
mm
range
Setting
the
threshold
at
12
for
the
2-9
mm
FNPO
offered
the
best
compromise
between
specificity
(99%)
and
sensitivity
(75%)
Within
the
2-5
mm
follicular
range
we
found
significant
positive
relationships
between
the
FNPO
and
androgens
The
FNPO
within
the
6-9
mm
range
was
significantly
and
negatively
related
to
body
mass
index
and
fasting
insulin
serum
level
We
propose
to
modify
the
definition
of
polycystic
ovaries
by
adding
the
presence
of
>
or
=12
follicles
measuring
2-9
mm
in
diameter
(mean
of
both
ovaries)
Also
our
findings
strengthen
the
hypothesis
that
the
intra-ovarian
hyperandrogenism
promotes
excessive
early
follicular
growth
and
that
further
progression
cannot
proceed
normally
because
of
hyperinsulinism
and/or
other
metabolic
influence
linked
to
obesity
