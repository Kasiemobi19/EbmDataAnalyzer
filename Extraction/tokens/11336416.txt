Abstract
Text
The
frequency
of
obtaining
false-negative
Group
A
Streptococcal
(GAS)
rapid
antigen
detection
(RAD)
tests
utilizing
currently
available
kits
in
a
private
practice
setting
and
the
cost
effectiveness
of
requiring
follow-up
throat
cultures
were
studied
Laboratory
records
of
the
Elmwood
Pediatric
Group
(EPG)
Rochester
NY
were
retrospectively
reviewed
to
identify
all
patients
with
pharyngeal
RAD
tests
for
GAS
performed
from
January
1996
through
May
1999
From
January
1996
through
October
1997
(study
period
1)
EPG
physicians
used
either
a
RAD
test
or
a
throat
culture
to
identify
GAS
from
November
1997
through
May
1999
(study
period
2)
RAD
tests
were
used
as
the
primary
test
on
all
patients
Rapid
antigen
detection
test
negative
results
were
confirmed
with
culture
During
the
3-year
study
11427
RAD
tests
were
performed
8385
(734%)
were
negative
and
3042
(266%)
were
positive
In
study
period
1
3547
(732%)
were
negative
and
1299
(268%)
were
positive
in
study
period
2
4837
(735%)
were
negative
and
1743
(265%)
were
positive
Of
the
8385
negative
tests
8234
(982%)
were
followed
up
with
throat
cultures
Of
these
200
(24%)
were
identified
to
have
been
negative
RAD
tests
that
were
throat
culture
positive
(132
[38%]
of
3474
in
study
period
1
and
68
[14%]
of
4764
in
study
period
2)
A
cost
analysis
was
performed
for
study
period
2
which
showed
that
abandoning
throat
culture
confirmation
would
generate
a
cost
saving
of
$13521
per
year
to
the
practice
Throat
culture
confirmation
of
RAD
test
negative
results
in
pharyngitis
patients
may
not
be
medically
necessary
for
most
patients
with
currently
available
RAD
tests
and
is
costly
