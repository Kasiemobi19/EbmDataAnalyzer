Abstract
Text
To
delineate
more
precisely
an
operational
threshold
for
making
clinical
decisions
based
on
ambulatory
blood
pressure
(ABP)
measurement
by
studying
the
ABP
in
subjects
who
were
diagnosed
as
either
normotensive
or
hypertensive
by
conventional
blood
pressure
(CBP)
measurement
Twenty-four
research
groups
recruited
7069
subjects
Of
these
4577
were
normotensive
(CBP
<
or
=
140/90
mmHg)
719
were
borderline
hypertensive
(systolic
CBP
141-159
mmHg
or
diastolic
CBP
91-94
mmHg)
and
1773
were
definitely
hypertensive
Of
the
subjects
in
the
last
of
these
categories
1324
had
systolic
hypertension
(systolic
CBP
>
or
=
160
mmHg)
and
1310
had
diastolic
hypertension
(diastolic
CBP
>
or
=
95
mmHg)
Hypertension
had
been
diagnosed
from
the
mean
of
two
to
nine
(median
two)
CBP
measurements
obtained
at
one
to
three
(median
two)
visits
The
95th
centiles
of
the
24-h
ABP
distributions
in
the
normotensive
subjects
were
(systolic
and
diastolic
respectively)
133
and
82
mmHg
Of
the
subjects
with
systolic
hypertension
24%
had
24-h
systolic
ABP
<
133
mmHg
Similarly
30%
of
those
with
diastolic
hypertension
had
24-h
diastolic
ABP
<
82
mmHg
The
probability
that
hypertensive
subjects
had
24-h
ABP
below
these
thresholds
tended
to
increase
with
age
and
was
two-
to
fourfold
greater
if
the
CBP
of
the
subject
had
been
measured
at
only
one
visit
and
if
fewer
than
three
CBP
measurements
had
been
averaged
for
establishing
the
diagnosis
of
hypertension
By
contrast
for
each
10-mmHg
increment
in
systolic
CBP
this
probability
decreased
by
54%
for
24-h
systolic
ABP
and
by
26%
for
24-h
diastolic
ABP
and
for
each
5-mmHg
increment
in
diastolic
CBP
it
decreased
by
6
and
9%
respectively
The
ABP
distributions
of
the
normotensive
subjects
included
in
the
present
international
database
were
not
materially
different
from
those
in
previous
reports
in
the
literature
One-fifth
to
more
than
one-third
of
hypertensive
subjects
had
an
ABP
which
was
below
the
95th
centile
of
the
ABP
of
normotensive
subjects
but
this
proportion
decreased
if
the
hypertensive
subjects
had
shown
a
higher
CBP
upon
repeated
measurement
The
prognostic
implications
of
elevated
CBP
in
the
presence
of
normal
ABP
remain
to
be
determined
