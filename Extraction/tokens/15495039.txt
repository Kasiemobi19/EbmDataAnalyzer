Oral
oestrogen
and
combined
oestrogen/progestogen
therapy
versus
placebo
for
hot
flushes
Abstract
Text
Hot
flushes
and
night
sweats
are
common
symptoms
experienced
by
menopausal
women
Hormone
therapy
(HT)
containing
oestrogens
alone
or
oestrogens
together
with
progestogens
in
a
cyclic
or
continuous
regimen
is
often
recommended
for
their
alleviation
To
examine
the
effect
of
oral
HT
compared
to
placebo
on
these
vasomotor
symptoms
and
the
risk
of
early
onset
side-effects
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Menstrual
Disorders
Group
and
Subfertility
Group
trials
register
(searched
May
2002)
This
register
is
based
on
regular
searches
of
MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
PsycINFO
the
handsearching
of
20
relevant
journals
and
conference
proceedings
and
searches
of
several
key
grey
literature
sources
We
also
contacted
all
relevant
pharmaceutical
companies
The
Journal
of
the
International
Menopause
Society
and
Climacteric
Double-blind
randomised
placebo-controlled
trials
of
oral
HT
for
at
least
three
months
duration
Study
quality
and
outcome
data
were
assessed
independently
Random
effects
models
were
considered
appropriate
due
to
the
variety
of
trial
methodologies
The
meta-analyses
were
explored
for
sensitivity
to
trial
quality
and
therapy
duration
Symptom
frequency
and
severity
were
assessed
separately
together
with
withdrawals
and
side-effects
Frequency
data
were
analysed
using
the
Weighted
Mean
Difference
(WMD)
between
treatment
and
placebo
outcomes
For
severity
data
odds
ratios
were
estimated
from
the
proportional
odds
model
From
115
references
originally
identified
24
trials
meeting
the
selection
criteria
were
included
in
the
review
Study
participants
totaled
3329
Trial
duration
ranged
from
three
months
to
three
years
There
was
a
significant
reduction
in
the
weekly
hot
flush
frequency
for
HT
compared
to
placebo
(WMD
-1792
95%
CI
-2286
to
-1299)
This
was
equivalent
to
a
75%
reduction
in
frequency
(95%
CI
643
to
823)
for
HT
relative
to
placebo
Symptom
severity
was
also
significantly
reduced
compared
to
placebo
(OR
013
95%
CI
007
to
023)
Withdrawal
for
lack
of
efficacy
occurred
significantly
more
often
on
placebo
therapy
(OR
1051
95%
CI
500
to
2209)
Withdrawal
for
adverse
events
commonly
breast
tenderness
oedema
joint
pain
and
psychological
symptoms
was
not
significantly
increased
(OR
125
95%
CI
083
to
190)
although
the
occurrence
of
any
adverse
events
was
significantly
increased
for
HT
(OR
141
95%
CI
100
to
199)
In
women
who
were
randomised
to
placebo
treatment
a
577%
(95%
CI
451
to
677)
reduction
in
hot
flushes
was
observed
between
baseline
and
end
of
study
Oral
HT
is
highly
effective
in
alleviating
hot
flushes
and
night
sweats
Therapies
purported
to
reduce
such
symptoms
must
be
assessed
in
blinded
trials
against
a
placebo
or
a
validated
therapy
because
of
the
large
placebo
effect
seen
in
well
conducted
randomised
controlled
trials
and
also
because
during
menopause
symptoms
may
fluctuate
and
after
menopause
symptoms
often
decline
Withdrawals
due
to
side-effects
were
only
marginally
increased
in
the
HT
groups
despite
the
inability
to
tailor
HT
in
these
fixed
dose
trials
Comparisons
of
hormonal
doses
product
types
or
regimens
require
analysis
of
trials
with
these
specific
"within
study"
comparisons
