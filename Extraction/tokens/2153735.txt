Title
Treatment
of
recurrent
herpes
simplex
labialis
with
oral
acyclovir
Abstract
Text
In
a
double-blind
randomized
patient-initiated
clinical
trial
174
nonimmunocompromised
patients
with
a
history
of
virus-culture-confirmed
herpes
simplex
labialis
were
treated
with
acyclovir
capsules
400
mg
five
times
daily
for
5
days
or
placebo
capsules
For
97%
of
the
patients
treatment
started
within
1
h
of
the
first
sign
or
symptom
of
a
recurrence
The
frequency
of
positive
lesion
virus
cultures
was
significantly
lower
among
acyclovir-treated
subjects
(29/114
25%)
than
among
placebo-treated
subjects
(29/60
48%
P
=
004)
Drug
treatment
did
not
affect
the
development
of
lesions
measured
by
the
frequency
of
macular
and
papular
(aborted)
lesions
and
mean
maximum
lesion
size
However
acyclovir
hastened
lesion
resolution
among
the
patients
who
could
start
treatment
in
the
prodrome
or
erythema
lesion
stage
For
this
group
the
mean
duration
of
pain
was
reduced
by
36%
(P
=
02)
and
the
mean
healing
time
to
loss
of
crust
by
27%
(P
=
03)
Thus
oral
acyclovir
alleviated
some
of
the
clinical
manifestations
of
herpes
simplex
labialis
