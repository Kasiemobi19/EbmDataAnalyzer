Title
Statins
in
children
Why
and
when
Abstract
Text
There
is
now
ample
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
atherosclerosis
begins
in
childhood
and
is
significantly
accelerated
in
certain
genetic
disorders
most
notably
familial
hypercholesterolemia
(FH)
Untreated
FH
both
the
homozygous
and
heterozygous
forms
carry
a
substantial
burden
of
morbidity
and
mortality
if
left
untreated
or
inadequately
treated
Males
with
FH
are
at
earlier
and
greater
risk
than
females
and
thus
should
begin
therapy
earlier
preferably
at
about
10
While
bile
acid
sequestrants
have
long
been
considered
the
drug
of
choice
in
children
they
have
never
been
approved
for
pediatric
use
by
FDA
are
poorly
tolerated
marginally
effective
at
lowering
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
and
have
minimal
well
controlled
studies
in
children
upon
which
to
adequately
assess
safety
Over
the
last
decade
statins
have
been
studied
extensively
in
children
and
adolescents
although
many
of
these
studies
have
also
been
poorly
controlled
of
short
duration
too
small
and
lack
detailed
assessment
However
there
has
been
at
least
one
large
randomized
placebo-controlled
and
comprehensive
study
with
lovastatin
in
adolescent
males
that
indicated
efficacy
similar
to
that
anticipated
in
adults
and
no
apparent
safety
concerns
While
additional
well-controlled
studies
are
needed
especially
those
focusing
on
surrogates
of
atherosclerosis
to
determine
clinical
benefit
it
is
opportune
for
re-evaluation
of
current
treatment
guidelines
