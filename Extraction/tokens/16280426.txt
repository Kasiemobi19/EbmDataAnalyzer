study
reduction

Abstract
Text
Epidemiologic
studies
link
Mediterranean-type
diets
to
a
low
incidence
of
cardiovascular
disease
however
few
dietary
intervention
studies
have
been
undertaken
especially
in
primary
prevention
In
the
Mediterranean
Diet
Cardiovascular
Risks
and
Gene
Polymorphisms
(Medi-RIVAGE)
study
the
effects
of
a
Mediterranean-type
diet
(Med
group)
or
a
low-fat
diet
(low-fat
group)
on
risk
factors
were
evaluated
in
212
volunteers
(men
and
women)
with
moderate
risk
factors
for
cardiovascular
disease
After
the
3-mo
dietary
intervention
changes
in
many
risk
factors
were
evaluated
Dietary
questionnaires
and
plasma
nutritional
markers
were
used
to
test
compliance
Although
the
dietary
goals
were
only
partially
reached
changes
in
dietary
habits
were
observed
in
both
groups
(n
=
169)
protein
carbohydrate
and
fiber
intakes
increased
and
fat
quality
(decreased
saturated
fat
and
increased
monounsaturated
or
polyunsaturated
fat)
improved
BMI
total
and
triacylglycerol-rich
lipoprotein
(TRL)
cholesterol
triacylglycerols
TRL
triacylglycerols
apolipoproteins
A-I
and
B
insulinemia
glycemia
and
the
homeostasis
model
assessment
score
were
significantly
lower
after
3
mo
The
reductions
in
total
cholesterol
triacylglycerols
and
insulinemia
remained
significant
after
adjustment
for
BMI
There
was
a
trend
for
a
diet-by-time
interaction
for
LDL
cholesterol
(P
=
009)
Our
data
predicted
a
9%
reduction
in
cardiovascular
disease
risk
with
the
low-fat
diet
and
a
15%
reduction
with
this
particular
Mediterranean
diet
After
a
3-mo
intervention
both
diets
significantly
reduced
cardiovascular
disease
risk
factors
to
an
overall
comparable
extent
