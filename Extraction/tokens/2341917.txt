Recognition
and
evaluation
of
red
blood
cell
macrocytosis
in
the
primary
care
setting
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
primary
care
physicians'
recognition
and
evaluation
of
red
blood
cell
(RBC)
macrocytosis
in
adults
Retrospective
chart
review
Utilizing
a
computerized
laboratory
result
system
all
complete
blood
counts
(CBCs)
with
RBC
indices
performed
between
May
1986
and
May
1987
were
retrieved
Patients
having
mean
corpuscular
volumes
(MCVs)
more
than
three
standard
deviations
from
the
mean
(greater
than
985
fL)
were
selected
for
evaluation
The
primary
care
clinics
of
a
public
university
hospital
138
(37%)
of
3805
adult
outpatients
had
MCVs
greater
than
985
fL
and
of
these
128
(934%)
had
medical
charts
available
for
review
55
patients
with
elevated
MCVs
were
not
evaluated
for
this
finding
and
their
mean
MCV
(1006
fL)
was
significantly
lower
than
that
of
the
73
patients
who
were
evaluated
(1025
fL
p
=
0003)
The
investigation
of
macrocytosis
included
vitamin
B12
and
folate
levels
consistently
and
the
reticulocyte
count
and
peripheral
smear
were
examined
infrequently
Five
patients
had
vitamin
B12
deficiency
and
two
had
hypothyroidism
Macrocytosis
was
ascribed
to
alcohol
abuse
in
47
patients
six
of
whom
had
no
laboratory
evaluation
Nine
alcoholic
patients
with
macrocytosis
had
other
causes
for
this
finding
Among
the
55
patients
whose
macrocytosis
was
not
evaluated
12
were
anemic
and
one
had
a
peripheral
neuropathy
Clinically
significant
and
treatable
disease
was
often
associated
with
macrocytosis
in
our
study
Macrocytosis
was
common
and
its
recognition
and
evaluation
were
variable
in
this
primary
care
outpatient
setting
