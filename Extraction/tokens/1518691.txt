Iron
status
in
exclusively
breast-fed
infants
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
evaluate
the
iron
nutritional
status
of
infants
breast-fed
exclusively
and
for
a
prolonged
period
in
relation
to
their
growth
rate
and
dietary
changes
Forty
subjects
(25
breast-fed
15
formula-fed)
were
studied
from
0
to
9
months
of
age
Milk
(human
or
formula)
was
the
only
source
of
food
during
the
first
6
months
From
the
sixth
month
onward
mothers
were
instructed
to
use
iron-
and
ascorbic
acid-rich
foods
to
supplement
breast-feeding
At
the
ninth
month
prevalence
of
anemia
was
278%
in
the
breast-fed
group
and
71%
in
the
formula-fed
group
Storage
iron
was
absent
in
278%
of
the
breast-fed
infants
vs
none
of
the
formula-fed
infants
These
findings
reinforce
the
recommendation
that
breast-fed
infants
be
given
supplemental
iron
from
the
fourth
month
of
life
