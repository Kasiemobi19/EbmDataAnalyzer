Efficacy
and
safety
of
tacrolimus
ointment
compared
with
that
of
hydrocortisone
acetate
ointment
in
children
with
atopic
dermatitis
Abstract
Text
Vehicle-controlled
studies
have
demonstrated
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
tacrolimus
ointment
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
atopic
dermatitis
(AD)
This
study
was
undertaken
to
compare
003%
and
01%
tacrolimus
ointment
with
1%
hydrocortisone
acetate
ointment
in
children
2
to
15
years
of
age
with
moderate-to-severe
AD
Treatment
was
twice
daily
to
affected
areas
for
3
weeks
in
this
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
parallel-group
study
The
primary
endpoint
was
the
modified
eczema
area
and
severity
index
(mEASI)
mean
area
under
the
curve
(mAUC)
as
a
percentage
of
baseline
Five
hundred
sixty
patients
were
randomized
and
received
at
least
one
application
of
ointment
Discontinuations
included
21
of
189
patients
from
the
003%
tacrolimus
group
13
of
186
patients
from
the
01%
tacrolimus
group
and
20
of
185
patients
from
the
hydrocortisone
acetate
group
The
median
mEASI
mAUC
as
a
percentage
of
baseline
showed
003%
and
01%
tacrolimus
to
be
significantly
more
effective
than
1%
hydrocortisone
acetate
(P
<001)
and
01%
tacrolimus
to
be
more
effective
than
003%
tacrolimus
(P
=006)
The
mEASI
mAUC
as
a
percentage
of
baseline
was
448%
398%
and
640%
for
patients
who
received
003%
tacrolimus
01%
tacrolimus
and
1%
hydrocortisone
acetate
respectively
Transient
skin
burning
was
the
only
adverse
event
to
show
a
higher
incidence
in
the
tacrolimus
treatment
groups
than
in
the
hydrocortisone
acetate
group
(P
<05)
Laboratory
parameters
showed
no
treatment
differences
and
no
marked
changes
over
time
Tacrolimus
003%
and
01%
was
significantly
more
effective
than
1%
hydrocortisone
acetate
and
01%
tacrolimus
was
more
effective
than
003%
tacrolimus
in
the
treatment
of
moderate-to-severe
AD
in
children
No
safety
concerns
were
identified
