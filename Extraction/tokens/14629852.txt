blood

and
lipid

in
a
randomized

trial
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
effects
on
blood
pressure
lipid
profile
and
anxiety
status
on
subjects
received
a
12-week
Tai
Chi
Chuan
exercise
program
Randomized
controlled
study
of
a
Tai
Chi
Chuan
group
and
a
group
of
sedentary
life
controls
Taipei
Medical
University
Hospitals
and
University
campus
in
the
Taipei
Taiwan
area
Two
(2)
selected
groups
of
76
healthy
subjects
with
blood
pressure
at
high-normal
or
stage
I
hypertension
A
12-week
Tai
Chi
Chuan
exercise
training
program
was
practiced
regularly
with
a
frequency
of
3
times
per
week
Each
session
included
10-minute
warm-up
30-minute
Tai
Chi
exercise
10-minute
cool-down
Exercise
intensity
was
estimated
to
be
approximately
64%
of
maximal
heart
rate
Blood
pressure
lipid
profile
and
anxiety
status
(State-Trait
Anxiety
Inventory
STAI)
were
evaluated
After
12-weeks
of
Tai
Chi
training
the
treatment
group
showed
significant
decrease
in
systolic
blood
pressure
of
156
mm
Hg
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
88
mm
Hg
The
serum
total
cholesterol
level
decreased
152
mg/dL
and
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
increased
47
mg/dL
By
using
STAI
evaluation
both
trait
anxiety
and
state
anxiety
were
decreased
This
study
shows
that
under
well-designed
conditions
Tai
Chi
exercise
training
could
decrease
blood
pressure
and
results
in
favorable
lipid
profile
changes
and
improve
subjects'
anxiety
status
Therefore
Tai
Chi
could
be
used
as
an
alternative
modality
in
treating
patients
with
mild
hypertension
with
a
promising
economic
effect
