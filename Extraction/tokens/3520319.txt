Prevention

chemoprophylaxis
Abstract
Text
Most
cases
of
neonatal
group
B
streptococcal
disease
with
early
onset
have
an
intrapartum
pathogenesis
Attack
rates
are
increased
substantially
in
infants
born
to
mothers
with
prenatal
group
B
streptococcal
colonization
and
various
perinatal
risk
factors
(premature
labor
prolonged
membrane
rupture
or
intrapartum
fever)
In
a
randomized
controlled
trial
we
studied
the
effect
of
selective
intrapartum
prophylaxis
with
ampicillin
in
160
such
high-risk
women
In
infants
born
to
mothers
who
received
intravenous
ampicillin
during
labor
as
compared
with
controls
who
received
no
treatment
neonatal
colonization
with
group
B
streptococci
was
present
in
8
of
85
(9
percent)
versus
40
of
79
(51
percent
P
less
than
0001)
colonization
at
multiple
(greater
than
or
equal
to
3)
sites
was
observed
in
3
of
85
(4
percent)
versus
24
of
79
(30
percent
P
less
than
0001)
and
bacteremia
occurred
in
none
of
85
versus
5
of
79
(6
percent
P
=
0024)
The
side
effects
of
ampicillin
were
limited
to
a
single
episode
of
urticaria
in
a
mother
who
had
no
history
of
penicillin
allergy
We
conclude
that
intrapartum
ampicillin
prophylaxis
in
women
with
positive
prenatal
cultures
for
group
B
streptococci
who
have
certain
perinatal
risk
factors
can
prevent
early-onset
neonatal
group
B
streptococcal
disease
