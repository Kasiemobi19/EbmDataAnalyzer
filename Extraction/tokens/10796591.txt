Title
Short
course
antibiotics
for
acute
otitis
media
Abstract
Text
Otitis
media
is
a
common
pediatric
problem
for
which
antibiotics
are
frequently
prescribed
To
determine
the
effectiveness
of
a
short
course
of
antibiotics
(less
than
seven
days)
in
comparison
to
a
longer
course
(seven
days
or
greater)
for
the
treatment
of
acute
otitis
media
in
children
The
medical
literature
was
searched
for
randomized
controlled
studies
of
the
treatment
of
ear
infections
in
children
with
antibiotics
published
from
January
1966
to
July
1997

Studies
were
included
if
they
met
the
following
criteria
subjects
one
month
to
18
years
of
age
clinical
diagnosis
of
ear
infection
no
previous
antimicrobial
therapy
and
randomization
to
treatment
with
less
than
seven
days
versus
seven
days
or
more
of
antibiotics
Data
on
treatment
outcomes
were
extracted
from
individual
studies
and
combined
in
the
form
of
a
summary
odds
ratio
A
summary
odds
ratio
(OR)
equivalent
to
one
indicated
that
the
treatment
failure
rate
following
less
than
seven
days
of
antibiotic
treatment
was
similar
to
the
failure
rate
following
seven
days
or
more
of
antibiotic
The
summary
OR
for
treatment
outcomes
at
eight
to
19
days
in
1524
children
treated
with
short-acting
antibiotics
for
five
days
versus
eight
to
10
days
was
152
95%
CI
117-198
but
by
20
to
30
days
outcomes
between
treatment
groups
(n=2115)
were
comparable
(OR=122
95%
CI098-154)
The
absolute
difference
in
treatment
failure
(Random
effects
model
RD=29%
95%CI-03%
to
61%)
at
20
to
30
days
suggests
that
at
minimum
17
children
would
need
to
be
treated
with
the
long
course
of
short-acting
antibiotics
to
avoid
one
treatment
failure
Similarity
in
outcomes
was
observed
for
up
to
three
months
following
therapy
(OR=11695%
CI=09-15)
Comparable
outcomes
were
shown
between
treatment
with
ceftriaxone
or
azithromycin
and
more
than
seven
days
of
other
antibiotics
This
review
suggests
that
five
days
of
short-acting
antibiotic
is
effective
treatment
for
uncomplicated
ear
infections
in
children
