Title
Acute
soft
tissue
injuries--a
review
of
the
literature
Abstract
Text
The
classification
pathology
and
management
of
acute
soft
tissue
injuries
are
reviewed
Classifications
based
on
etiology
and
severity
are
outlined
The
pathological
processes
at
a
cellular
level
are
described
in
three
phases
acute
inflammatory
repair
and
remodelling
the
management
of
acute
soft
tissue
trauma
is
embodied
in
the
acronym
RICE
for
rest
ice
compression
and
elevation
during
the
first
48
to
72
h
Additional
benefit
from
anti-prostaglandin
medications
has
not
been
clearly
demonstrated
in
clinical
trials
and
if
used
these
medications
should
be
restricted
to
the
first
3
days
Cryotherapy
(crushed
ice)
for
10
to
20
min
2
to
4
times/day
for
the
first
2
to
3
days
is
helpful
in
promoting
early
return
to
full
activity
Early
mobilization
guided
by
the
pain
response
promotes
a
more
rapid
return
to
full
activity
Early
mobilization
guided
by
the
pain
response
promotes
a
more
rapid
return
to
full
functional
recovery
Progressive
resistance
exercises
(isotonic
isokinetic
and
isometric)
are
essential
to
restore
full
muscle
and
joint
function
Rehabilitation
is
complete
when
the
injured
and
adjacent
tissues
are
restored
to
full
pain-free
functional
capacity
under
competitive
conditions
in
association
with
the
necessary
level
of
cardiovascular
respiratory
fitness
