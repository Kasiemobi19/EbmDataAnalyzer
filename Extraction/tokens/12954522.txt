Abstract
Text
This
study
aimed
to
assess
the
prevalence
of
bacterial
vaginosis
(BV)
and
other
cervicovaginal
infections
as
well
as
the
incidence
of
complications
among
new
users
of
IUD
1
and
6
months
after
its
insertion
in
the
City
of
Campinas
Brazil
A
total
of
223
women
who
had
a
TCu-380A
IUD
inserted
from
May
through
November
2001
were
included
in
the
study
After
the
IUD
insertion
all
women
were
scheduled
to
two
additional
visits
after
1
month
and
after
6
months
when
they
were
interviewed
and
a
pelvic
examination
was
performed
along
with
a
collection
of
specimens
from
the
vagina
and
the
endocervix
for
laboratory
testing
The
Nugent's
criterion
was
used
for
the
BV
diagnosis
They
were
also
evaluated
with
regard
to
presence
of
complications
possibly
related
to
IUD
insertion
and
use
ie
abnormal
bleeding
dysmenorrhea
expulsion
and
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
The
prevalence
of
cervicovaginal
infections
was
291%
BV
being
the
most
frequent
(197%)
Dysmenorrhea
was
more
frequent
among
women
with
BV
than
among
women
without
BV
(p
=
003)
A
trend
of
abnormal
bleeding
being
more
frequent
among
women
with
BV
was
also
found
In
conclusion
BV
after
1
month
of
IUD
insertion
was
not
associated
with
IUD
complications
with
the
exception
of
dysmenorrhea
