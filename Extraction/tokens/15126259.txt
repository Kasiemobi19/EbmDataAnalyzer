Lung

screening

and
computed

an
update
for
the

Preventive

Task

Abstract
Text
Lung
cancer
is
the
leading
cause
of
cancer-related
death
in
the
United
States
and
worldwide
No
major
professional
organizations
including
the
US
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
(USPSTF)
currently
recommend
screening
for
lung
cancer
To
examine
the
evidence
evaluating
screening
for
lung
cancer
with
chest
radiography
sputum
cytologic
examination
and
low-dose
computed
tomography
(CT)
to
aid
the
USPSTF
in
updating
its
recommendation
on
lung
cancer
screening
MEDLINE
the
Cochrane
Library
reviews
editorials
and
experts
Studies
that
evaluated
mass
screening
programs
for
lung
cancer
involving
the
tests
of
interest
were
selected
All
studies
were
reviewed
but
only
studies
with
control
groups
were
rated
in
quality
since
these
would
most
directly
influence
the
USPSTF
screening
recommendation
Data
were
abstracted
to
data
collection
forms
Studies
were
graded
according
to
criteria
developed
by
the
USPSTF
None
of
the
6
randomized
trials
of
screening
for
lung
cancer
with
chest
radiography
alone
or
in
combination
with
sputum
cytologic
examination
showed
benefit
among
those
screened
All
studies
were
limited
because
some
level
of
screening
occurred
in
the
control
population
Five
case-control
studies
from
Japan
suggested
benefit
to
both
high-
and
low-risk
men
and
women
All
studies
were
limited
by
potential
healthy
screenee
bias
Six
cohort
studies
showed
that
when
CT
was
used
to
screen
for
lung
cancer
lung
cancer
was
diagnosed
at
an
earlier
stage
than
in
usual
clinical
care
However
these
studies
did
not
have
control
groups
making
mortality
evaluation
difficult
In
addition
the
studies
demonstrated
a
high
rate
of
false-positive
findings
Current
data
do
not
support
screening
for
lung
cancer
with
any
method
These
data
however
are
also
insufficient
to
conclude
that
screening
does
not
work
particularly
in
women
Two
randomized
trials
of
screening
with
chest
radiography
or
low-dose
CT
are
currently
under
way
and
will
better
inform
lung
cancer
screening
decisions
