Topical
treatments
for
fungal
infections
of
the
skin
and
nails
of
the
foot
Abstract
Text
The
objective
of
this
review
is
to
identify
and
evaluate
the
evidence
of
efficacy
for
topical
treatments
for
fungal
infections
of
the
skin
and
nails
of
the
human
foot
To
establish
the
effectiveness
of
topical
treatments
in
achieving
a
cured
condition
and
in
preventing
recurrence

Randomised
controlled
trials
were
identified
from
the
MEDLINE
EMBASE
and
CINHAL
databases
from
the
beginning
of
these
databases
to
December
1997
Also
we
screened
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
the
Science
Citation
Index
BIOSIS
CAB
-
Health
Healthstar
and
Economic
databases
References
and
unpublished
studies
were
searched
podiatry
journals
handsearched
and
the
pharmaceutical
industry
contacted
Only
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
using
participants
who
have
mycologically
diagnosed
fungal
infections
of
the
skin
and
nails
of
the
human
foot
are
included
in
the
analysis
Two
reviewers
independently
summarised
the
included
trials
and
appraised
their
quality
of
reporting
using
a
structured
data
extraction
tool
which
assessed
12
quality
criteria
Of
126
trials
identified
in
121
papers
72
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Placebo-controlled
trials
yielded
the
following
pooled
relative
risks
of
failure
to
cure
(RRFC)
for
skin
infections
allylamines
030
(95%
confidence
interval
023
to
037)
azoles
053
(042
to
068)
undecenoic
acid
028
(011
to
074)
tolnaftate
046
(017
to
122)
Though
meta-analysis
of
11
trials
comparing
allylamines
and
azoles
showed
an
RRFC
of
088
(078
to
099)
in
favour
of
allylamines
there
was
evidence
of
language
bias
Seven
English
language
reports
favoured
allylamines
(RRFC
=
079
068
to
093)
but
four
foreign
language
reports
showed
no
difference
between
the
two
drugs
(RRFC
=
100
090
to
112)
The
two
trials
of
nail
infections
did
not
provide
any
evidence
of
benefit
for
topical
treatments
compared
with
placebo
In
placebo-controlled
trials
allylamines
azoles
and
undecenoic
acid
were
efficacious
There
are
sufficient
comparative
trials
to
judge
relative
efficacy
only
between
allylamines
and
azoles
Allylamines
cure
slightly
more
infections
than
azoles
but
are
much
more
expensive
The
most
cost-effective
strategy
is
first
to
treat
with
azoles
or
undecenoic
acid
and
to
use
allylamines
only
if
that
fails
