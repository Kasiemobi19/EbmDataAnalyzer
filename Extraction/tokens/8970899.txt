Correcting
calcium
nutritional
deficiency
prevents
spine
fractures
in
elderly
women
Abstract
Text
We
tested
the
spine
antifracture
and
bone
sparing
efficacy
of
12
g/day
of
oral
calcium
as
carbonate
in
two
groups
of
elderly
women
one
with
prevalent
fractures
(PF
n
=
94)
on
entry
and
the
other
without
(NPF
n
=
103)
It
was
a
prospective
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
in
mostly
rural
communities
in
women
over
age
60
who
were
living
independently
and
were
consuming
<
1
g/day
of
calcium
We
obtained
annual
lateral
spine
radiographs
and
semiannual
forearm
bone
density
over
43
+/-
11
years
and
determined
vertebral
fractures
by
radiographic
morphometry
augmented
by
physician
assessment
In
the
PF
group
15
of
53
subjects
on
calcium
had
incident
fractures
compared
with
21
of
41
on
placebo
(p
=
0023
chi2)
Calcium
did
not
reduce
the
rate
of
incident
fractures
in
the
NPF
group
Those
with
a
prevalent
fracture
on
entry
and
not
treated
with
calcium
were
28
times
more
likely
to
experience
an
incident
fracture
than
all
others
Change
in
the
forearm
bone
mass
on
placebo
in
the
PF
group
was
-124
+/-
241%/year
compared
with
+031
+/-
180%/year
on
calcium
(p
<
0001)
In
the
NPF
group
the
difference
was
less
-039
+/-
208%/year
versus
000
+/-
164%/year
(p
=
02)
We
conclude
that
in
elderly
postmenopausal
women
with
spine
fractures
and
selfselected
calcium
intakes
of
<
1
g/day
a
calcium
supplement
of
12
g/day
reduces
the
incidence
of
spine
fractures
and
halts
measurable
bone
loss
