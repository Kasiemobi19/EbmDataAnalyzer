Successful
treatment
and
prophylaxis
of
scalp
seborrhoeic
dermatitis
and
dandruff
with
2%
ketoconazole
shampoo
results
of
a
multicentre
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Pityrosporum
ovale
appears
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
seborrhoeic
dermatitis
Ketoconazole
is
an
antimycotic
agent
with
a
high
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
efficacy
against
P
ovale
We
performed
a
multicentre
study
to
investigate
the
efficacy
of
ketoconazole
2%
shampoo
in
the
treatment
and
prophylaxis
of
seborrhoeic
dermatitis
and
dandruff
Five
hundred
and
seventy-five
patients
presenting
with
moderate
to
severe
seborrhoeic
dermatitis
and
dandruff
of
the
scalp
were
treated
with
2%
ketoconazole
shampoo
twice
weekly
for
2-4
weeks
producing
an
excellent
response
in
88%
Of
those
patients
who
responded
312
were
included
in
a
prophylactic
phase
lasting
6
months
These
patients
were
treated
with
the
active
preparation
(shampoo
containing
2%
ketoconazole)
once-weekly
once
every
other
week
alternating
with
placebo
(shampoo
without
ketoconazole)
or
with
placebo
only
once-weekly
Forty-eight
(47%)
patients
in
the
placebo
group
experienced
a
relapse
of
seborrhoeic
dermatitis
compared
with
23
(19%)
patients
in
the
active
treatment
group
and
31
(31%)
patients
in
the
active/placebo
group
The
medication
was
well
tolerated
in
all
three
groups
We
conclude
that
ketoconazole
2%
shampoo
is
highly
effective
not
only
in
clearing
scalp
seborrhoeic
dermatitis
and
dandruff
but
also
in
preventing
relapse
of
the
disease
when
used
prophylactically
once
weekly
