Title
Stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
in
the
postoperative
period
Abstract
Text
The
implications
of
recent
studies
for
guidelines
that
pertain
to
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
in
the
postoperative
period
are
discussed
The
therapeutic
guidelines
on
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
published
by
the
American
Society
of
Health-System
Pharmacists
(ASHP)
provided
clinicians
with
recommendations
regarding
appropriate
candidates
for
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
and
selection
of
a
pharmacologic
agent
Since
these
guidelines
were
published
in
1999
additional
research
has
been
completed
to
resolve
some
of
the
controversial
issues
surrounding
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
The
frequency
of
stress-induced
bleeding
in
recent
investigations
continues
to
be
highly
variable
depending
on
the
definition
used
to
describe
bleeding
In
general
investigations
that
evaluate
overt
bleeding
or
bleeding
without
hemodynamic
changes
or
blood
transfusion
report
higher
frequencies
of
bleeding
than
those
that
evaluate
clinically
important
bleeding
Similar
to
that
reported
in
the
initial
ASHP
guidelines
the
frequency
of
clinically
important
bleeding
in
recent
investigations
is
low
In
addition
the
majority
of
recently
published
prospective
studies
and
a
meta-analysis
have
been
unable
to
demonstrate
a
reduction
in
clinically
important
bleeding
with
pharmacologic
agents
As
a
result
some
experts
have
suggested
that
advances
in
critical
care
are
more
influential
in
the
development
of
stress-induced
bleeding
than
the
use
of
pharmacologic
agents
Recently
published
investigations
support
the
effectiveness
of
institution-specific
guidelines
to
help
clinicians
identify
appropriate
candidates
for
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
The
selection
of
an
optimal
pharmacologic
agent
for
stress
ulcer
prophylaxis
continues
to
be
debated
The
majority
of
recent
studies
have
involved
the
administration
of
proton-pump
inhibitors
(PPIs)
In
general
these
studies
have
demonstrated
that
PPIs
are
at
least
as
effective
as
histamine
H2-receptor
antagonists
at
increasing
gastric
pH
but
adequately
powered
studies
investigating
the
endpoint
of
clinically
important
bleeding
are
needed
Similar
to
the
initial
ASHP
guidelines
the
development
of
institution-specific
guidelines
is
recommended
to
identify
the
most
appropriate
pharmacologic
treatment
The
frequency
of
clinically
important
bleeding
reported
in
recent
studies
is
low
The
majority
of
recently
published
prospective
studies
and
meta-analyses
found
little
significant
reduction
in
bleeding
with
pharmacologic
prophylaxis
