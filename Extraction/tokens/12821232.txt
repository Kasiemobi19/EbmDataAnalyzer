Title
Secondary
prevention
with
folic
acid
effects
on
clinical
outcomes
Abstract
Text
We
sought
to
conduct
a
randomized
trial
with
folic
acid
05
mg/day
in
a
patient
population
with
stable
coronary
artery
disease
(CAD)
Folic
acid
has
favorable
effects
on
vascular
endothelium
and
lowers
plasma
homocysteine
levels
In
addition
homocysteine
appears
to
be
an
independent
risk
factor
for
atherosclerotic
disease
However
the
value
of
folic
acid
in
secondary
prevention
had
seldom
been
tested
In
this
open-label
study
593
patients
were
included
300
were
randomized
to
folic
acid
and
293
served
as
controls
Mean
follow-up
time
was
24
months
At
baseline
all
patients
had
been
on
statin
therapy
for
a
mean
of
32
years
In
patients
treated
with
folic
acid
plasma
homocysteine
levels
decreased
by
18%
from
120
+/-
48
to
94
+/-
35
micromol/l
whereas
these
levels
remained
unaffected
in
the
control
group
(p
<
0001
between
groups)
The
primary
end
point
(all-cause
mortality
and
a
composite
of
vascular
events)
was
encountered
in
31
(103%)
patients
in
the
folic
acid
group
and
in
28
(96%)
patients
in
the
control
group
(relative
risk
105
95%
confidence
interval
063
to
175)
In
a
multifactorial
survival
model
with
adjustments
for
clinical
factors
the
most
predictive
laboratory
parameters
were
in
order
of
significance
levels
of
creatinine
clearance
plasma
fibrinogen
and
homocysteine
Within
two
years
folic
acid
does
not
seem
to
reduce
clinical
end
points
in
patients
with
stable
coronary
artery
disease
(CAD)
while
on
statin
treatment
Homocysteine
might
therefore
merely
be
a
modifiable
marker
of
disease
Thus
low-dose
folic
acid
supplementation
should
be
treated
with
reservation
until
more
trial
outcomes
become
available
