Selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor-induced
sexual
dysfunction
efficacy
of
a
drug
holiday
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
whether
weekend
drug
holidays
would
improve
sexual
functioning
in
recovered
depressed
patients
with
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
(SSRI)-induced
sexual
dysfunction
Thirty
outpatients
who
reported
worsening
of
sexual
functioning
during
SSRI
treatment
were
instructed
to
discontinue
their
SSRIs
after
the
Thursday
morning
dose
and
to
restart
the
SSRIs
(at
their
previous
dosage)
on
Sunday
at
1200
noon
for
four
weekends
Significant
improvement
in
sexual
functioning
was
reported
by
the
patients
taking
sertraline
and
paroxetine
but
not
by
those
taking
fluoxetine
There
were
no
statistically
significant
increases
in
mean
Hamilton
depression
scores
after
discontinuation
of
the
SSRIs
two
patients
had
increases
in
scores
from
the
4-8
range
to
the
10-14
range
For
some
patients
taking
sertraline
and
paroxetine
who
experience
sexual
dysfunction
side
effects
brief
drug
holidays
may
allow
for
significant
improvement
in
sexual
functioning
without
a
significant
return
of
depressive
symptoms
