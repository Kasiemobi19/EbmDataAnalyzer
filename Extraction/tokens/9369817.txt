Controlled
cord
traction
versus
minimal
intervention
techniques
in
delivery
of
the
placenta
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Our
purpose
was
to
compare
the
controlled
cord
traction
technique
with
the
minimal
intervention
technique
for
delivery
of
the
placenta
The
primary
outcome
was
the
incidence
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
Secondary
outcomes
included
duration
of
third
stage
of
labor
frequency
of
retained
placenta
hemorrhagic
shock
the
need
for
blood
transfusion
and
the
need
for
uterotonic
agents
to
control
postpartum
hemorrhage
A
total
of
1648
women
who
were
delivered
vaginally
were
randomly
allocated
during
labor
to
the
controlled
cord
traction
group
(n
=
827)
or
the
minimal
intervention
group
(n
=
821)
In
the
controlled
cord
traction
group
women
received
oxytocin
10
units
intramuscularly
with
delivery
of
the
baby's
anterior
shoulder
after
which
the
placenta
was
delivered
actively
by
controlled
cord
traction
(Brandt-Andrews
method)
In
the
minimal
intervention
group
the
placenta
was
delivered
by
maternal
pushing
Continuous
intravenous
oxytocin
was
given
after
delivery
of
the
placenta
Odds
ratios
with
95%
confidence
intervals
were
calculated
for
each
variable
The
overall
incidence
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
was
significantly
lower
in
the
controlled
cord
traction
group
(58%
vs
11%
odds
ratio
050
95%
confidence
interval
034
to
073)
The
incidence
of
retained
placenta
(>
or
=
30
minutes)
was
16%
in
the
controlled
cord
traction
group
and
45%
in
the
minimal
intervention
group
(odds
ratio
031
95%
confidence
interval
015
to
063)
Significantly
more
patients
in
the
minimal
intervention
group
required
additional
uterotonic
agents
to
control
hemorrhage
(51%
vs
23%
odds
ratio
044
95%
confidence
interval
024
to
078)
The
controlled
cord
traction
technique
for
delivery
of
the
placenta
results
in
a
significantly
lower
incidence
of
postpartum
hemorrhage
and
retained
placenta
as
well
as
less
need
for
uterotonic
agents
compared
with
the
minimal
intervention
technique
