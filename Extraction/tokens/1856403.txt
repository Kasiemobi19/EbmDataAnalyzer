Abstract
Text
The
Canadian
Atrial
Fibrillation
Anticoagulation
Study
was
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
to
assess
the
potential
of
warfarin
to
reduce
systemic
thromboembolism
and
its
inherent
risk
of
hemorrhage
As
a
result
of
the
publication
of
two
other
"positive"
studies
of
similar
design
and
objective
this
study
was
stopped
early
before
completion
of
its
planned
recruitment
of
630
patients
There
were
187
patients
randomized
to
warfarin
and
191
to
placebo
Permanent
discontinuation
of
study
medication
occurred
in
26%
of
warfarin-treated
and
23%
of
placebo-treated
patients
The
target
range
of
the
international
normalized
ratio
was
2
to
3
For
the
warfarin-treated
patients
the
international
normalized
ratio
was
in
the
target
range
437%

it
166%
of
the
study
days
and
below

396%
of
the
study
days
Fatal
or
major
bleeding
occurred
at
annual
rates
of
25%
in
warfarin-treated
and
05%
in
placebo-treated
patients
Minor
bleeding
occurred
in
16%
of
patients
receiving
warfarin
and
9%
receiving
placebo
The
primary
outcome
event
cluster
was
nonlacunar
stroke
noncentral
nervous
systemic
embolism
and
fatal
or
intracranial
hemorrhage
Events
were
included
in
the
primary
analysis
of
efficacy
if
they
occurred
within
28
days
of
permanent
discontinuation
of
the
study
medication
The
annual
rates
of
the
primary
outcome
event
cluster
were
35%
in
warfarin-treated
and
52%
in
placebo-treated
