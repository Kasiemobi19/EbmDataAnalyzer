Title
Allergic
contact
dermatitis
in
children
a
practical
approach
to
management
Abstract
Text
Allergic
contact
dermatitis
(ACD)
may
account
for
at
least
20%
of
all
childhood
dermatitis
Clinically
its
morphology
is
identical
to
other
forms
of
dermatitis
in
acute
subacute
and
chronic
forms
A
persistent
or
unusual
and
localized
pattern
is
often
the
key
to
diagnosis
Treatment
has
centered
around
the
use
of
corticosteroids
with
the
adjunct
of
antihistamines
wet
dressings
and
emollients
for
alleviation
of
symptoms
The
newer
topical
immunosuppressives
tacrolimus
and
pimecrolimus
may
also
hold
promise
as
alternative
therapies
although
they
have
not
been
well-studied
in
this
regard
Allergen
identification
sometimes
through
patch
testing
and
allergen
avoidance
are
the
keys
to
preventing
recurrences
of
this
disease
