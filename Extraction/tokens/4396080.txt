Associations
between
drugs
administered
during
pregnancy
and
congenital
abnormalities
of
the
fetus
Abstract
Text
In
a
retrospective
study
to
compare
the
drug
consumption
during
pregnancy
of
mothers
of
infants
with
congenital
abnormalities
and
of
those
without
over
97%
of
1369
mothers
took
prescribed
drugs
and
65%
self-administered
drugs
Significantly
more
mothers
of
infants
with
congenital
abnormalities
took
aspirin
antacids
dextroamphetamine
phenobarbitone
sodium
amytal
other
barbiturates
cough
medicines
iron
sulphonamides
and
nicotinamide
than
mothers
in
the
control
group
However
most
mothers
taking
analgesics
antacids
appetite
suppressants
barbiturates
cough
medicines
iron
sulphonamides
and
vitamins
produced
normal
infants
Any
teratogenic
effect
of
these
drugs
is
therefore
one
of
low
potency
On
the
other
hand
deficiencies
such
as
those
of
ascorbic
acid
and
folic
acid
may
have
a
teratogenic
effect
There
is
need
for
caution
in
presuming
teratogenic
effects
on
the
basis
of
the
associations
shown
here
During
pregnancy
however
it
would
appear
wise
to
avoid
the
administration
of
any
drug
which
carries
a
suspicion
of
teratogenicity
unless
that
drug
is
specifically
indicated
and
self-medication
with
common
household
remedies
such
as
aspirin
and
antacids
should
be
avoided
These
recommendations
would
also
apply
to
any
woman
of
childbearing
age
in
whom
conception
is
likely
