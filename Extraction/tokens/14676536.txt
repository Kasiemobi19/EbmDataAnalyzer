Title
Treatment
for
idiopathic
toe-walking
results
at
skeletal
maturity
Abstract
Text
Thirteen
skeletally
mature
subjects
who
had
been
treated
as
children
for
idiopathic
toe-walking
underwent
gait
analysis
and
calf
muscle
strength
testing
at
an
average
of
108
years
from
the
last
intervention
Six
had
had
serial
casting
only
seven
had
had
either
a
percutaneous
tendo
Achilles
lengthening
or
a
Baker's
gastroc-soleus
lengthening
Sagittal
plane
kinematics
at
the
ankle
was
altered
in
12
of
the
13
subjects
but
the
changes
were
detectable
visually
in
only
3
subjects
One
subject
had
increased
ankle
plantarflexion
at
initial
contact
but
the
other
12
subjects
had
a
normal
first
rocker
Peak
ankle
dorsiflexion
in
stance
averaged
only
9
degrees
and
11
of
the
subjects
had
a
peak
ankle
dorsiflexion
in
stance
greater
than
2
standard
deviations
below
normative
values
Ankle
dorsiflexion
was
also
restricted
on
passive
measures
but
there
was
no
correlation
between
ankle
dorsiflexion
non-weight-bearing
and
in
gait
Inversion
of
second
rocker
was
seen
in
two
subjects
with
peak
ankle
dorsiflexion
in
stance
occurring
before
25%
of
the
gait
cycle
Power
generation
by
the
calf
during
a
single
heel-rise
test
was
variable
between
subjects
but
within
normative
values
compared
with
controls
The
authors
conclude
that
most
subjects
showed
persistent
changes
in
ankle
kinematics
and
kinetics
despite
treatment
but
that
this
was
not
detectable
visually
in
most
subjects
