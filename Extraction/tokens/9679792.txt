Fixed
minidose
warfarin
and
aspirin
alone
and
in
combination
vs
adjusted-dose
warfarin
for
stroke
prevention
in
atrial
fibrillation
Second
Copenhagen
Atrial
Fibrillation
Aspirin
and
Anticoagulation
Study
Abstract
Text
Despite
the
efficacy
of
warfarin
sodium
therapy
for
stroke
prevention
in
atrial
fibrillation
many
physicians
hesitate
to
prescribe
it
to
elderly
patients
because
of
the
risk
for
bleeding
complications
and
because
of
inconvenience
for
the
patients
The
Second
Copenhagen
Atrial
Fibrillation
Aspirin
and
Anticoagulation
Study
was
a
randomized
controlled
trial
examining
the
following
therapies
warfarin
sodium
125
mg/d
warfarin
sodium
125
mg/d
plus
aspirin
300
mg/d
and
aspirin
300
mg/d
These
were
compared
with
adjusted-dose
warfarin
therapy
(international
normalized
ratio
of
prothrombin
time
[INR]
20-30)
Stroke
or
a
systemic
thromboembolic
event
was
the
primary
outcome
event
Transient
ischemic
attack
acute
myocardial
infarction
and
death
were
secondary
events
Data
were
handled
as
survival
data
and
risk
factors
were
identified
using
the
Cox
proportional
hazards
model
The
trial
was
scheduled
for
6
years
from
May
1
1993
but
due
to
scientific
evidence
of
inefficiency
of
low-intensity
warfarin
plus
aspirin
therapy
from
another
study
our
trial
was
prematurely
terminated
on
October
2
1996
We
included
677
patients
(median
age
74
years)
The
cumulative
primary
event
rate
after
1
year
was
58%
in
patients
receiving
minidose
warfarin
72%
warfarin
plus
aspirin
36%
aspirin
and
28%
adjusted-dose
warfarin
(P
=
67)
After
3
years
no
difference
among
the
groups
was
seen
Major
bleeding
events
were
rare
Although
the
difference
was
insignificant
adjusted-dose
warfarin
seemed
superior
to
minidose
warfarin
and
to
warfarin
plus
aspirin
after
1
year
of
treatment
The
results
do
not
justify
a
change
in
the
current
recommendation
of
adjusted-dose
warfarin
(INR
20-30)
for
stroke
prevention
in
atrial
fibrillation
