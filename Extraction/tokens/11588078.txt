Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
progesterone
and
progestogens
in
the
management
of
premenstrual
syndrome
Systematic
review
of
published
randomised
placebo
controlled
trials
Studies
reviewed
10
trials
of
progesterone
therapy
(531
women)
and
four
trials
of
progestogen
therapy
(378
women)
Proportion
of
women
whose
symptoms
showed
improvement
with
progesterone
preparations
(suppositories
and
oral
micronised)
Proportion
of
women
whose
symptoms
showed
improvement
with
progestogens
Secondary
analysis
of
efficacy
of
progesterone
and
progestogens
in
managing
physical
and
behavioural
symptoms
Overall
standardised
mean
difference
for
all
trials
that
assessed
efficacy
of
progesterone
(by
both
routes
of
administration)
was
-0028
(95%
confidence
interval
-0017
to
-0040)
The
odds
ratio
was
105
(103
to
108)
in
favour
of
progesterone
indicating
no
clinically
important
difference
between
progesterone
and
placebo
For
progestogens
the
overall
standardised
mean
was
-0036
(-0014
to
-0060)
which
corresponds
to
an
odds
ratio
of
107
(103
to
111)
showing
a
statistically
but
not
clinically
significant
improvement
for
women
taking
progestogens
The
evidence
from
these
meta-analyses
does
not
support
the
use
of
progesterone
or
progestogens
in
the
management
of
premenstrual
syndrome
