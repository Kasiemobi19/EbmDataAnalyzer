Abstract
Text
Traditionally
patients
with
acute
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
are
treated
with
strict
bed
rest
for
several
days
to
avoid
clots
from
breaking
off
and
causing
pulmonary
emboli
The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
give
a
precise
estimate
of
short
term
complications
like
pulmonary
embolism
bleeding
heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
(HIT)
and
death
in
a
cohort
of
consecutive
patients
who
were
admitted
because
of
acute
symptomatic
DVT
all
treated
by
compression
and
walking
exercises
instead
of
conventional
bed-rest
and
nearly
all
by
low-molecular-weight
heparin
In
1289
consecutive
patients
the
following
five
endpoints
were
registered
for
the
period
of
hospital-stay
1
Frequency
of
pulmonary
embolism
(PE)
at
admission
(V/Q
lung
scan)
2
Frequency
of
new
PE's
after
10
days
(second
lung
scan)
3
Fatal
events
(autopsy)
4
Frequency
of
malignant
disease
5
Bleeding
complications
and
HIT

1
190/356
(534%
of
iliofemoral
355/675
(526%)
of
femoral
and
84/239
(351%)
of
lower
leg
vein
thrombosis
showed
PE
(difference
iliofemoral
and
femoral
versus
lower
leg
DVT
p
<
0001)
Two
thirds
of
these
PE
were
asymptomatic
2
New
PE
after
10
days
in
comparison
to
the
baseline
scan
occurred
in
74%
64%
and
34%
respectively
3
Fatal
events
all
investigated
by
autopsy
were
caused
by
PE
in
3
patients
aged
over
76
years
(023%)
by
malignant
diseases
in
12
(09%)
and
due
to
other
causes
in
2
(015%)
4
232
patients
(18%)
had
associated
malignant
diseases
from
which
33%
were
detected
by
our
screening
5
Non-fatal
bleeding
complications
were
seen
in
33%
including
5
patients
(04%)
with
major
bleeding
Three
patients
(02%)
suffered
from
HIT
II
The
low
incidence
of
recurrent
and
fatal
pulmonary
emboli
in
this
series
affirms
the
value
of
early
ambulation
with
heavy
leg
compression
in
patients
with
symptomatic
acute
leg
deep
venous
thrombosis
In
addition
the
presence
of
pulmonary
emboli
in
one-third
of
those
with
calf
vein
thrombi
emphasizes
the
importance
of
fully
diagnosing
and
treating
calf
clots
