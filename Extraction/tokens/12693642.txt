Predictors
of
six-month
survival
among
patients
with
dementia
an
evaluation
of
hospice
Medicare
guidelines
Abstract
Text
The
goal
of
the
present
study
was
to
assess
the
validity
of
the
Medicare
hospice
eligibility
guidelines
for
dementia
patients
as
well
as
identify
predictors
that
could
more
accurately
identify
prognosis
in
dementia
patients
referred
to
hospice
A
retrospective
chart
review
was
conducted
including
initial
assessment
and
longitudinal
follow-up
of
patients
until
the
time
of
death
In
addition
a
second
validation
cohort
was
also
followed
Participants
consisted
of
245
patients
admitted
to
a
large
community-based
hospice
with
a
diagnosis
of
dementia
including
a
validation
sample
of
80
patients
The
Kaplan-Meier
estimation
of
survival
and
a
Cox
regression
analysis
(p
>
0
05)
revealed
no
significant
relationship
between
the
Medicare
guidelines
or
any
component
of
the
guidelines
and
survival
at
six
months
for
the
initial
and
validation
samples
Significant
multivariate
predictors
of
shorter
survival
in
both
the
initial
and
validation
sample
include
greater
age
(p
=
0
02)
and
anorexia
(p
<
0
001)
as
well
as
a
combination
of
anorexia
and
greater
functional
impairment
(p
=
0005)
Overall
the
results
indicated
that
the
Medicare
guidelines
were
not
valid
predictors
of
survival
in
hospice
patients
with
dementia
and
should
be
altered
to
include
empirically
valid
predictors
Advanced
age
as
well
as
impaired
nutritional
and
functional
status
was
associated
with
shortened
survival
in
these
patients
The
predictor
variables
identified
are
an
initial
step
toward
providing
improved
prognoses
for
advanced
dementia
patients
their
families
and
practitioners
Broader
issues
in
improving
access
to
hospice
care
for
dementia
patients
are
discussed
