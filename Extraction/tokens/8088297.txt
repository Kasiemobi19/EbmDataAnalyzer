A
clinical
trial
with
an
"anti-regurgitation"
formula
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
a
new
"anti-regurgitation
formula"
containing
a
bean
gum
preparation
decreases
the
number
of
regurgitations
and
gastro-oesophageal
reflux
(GOR)
we
studied
20
infants
from
1
week
to
4
months
of
age
referred
for
evaluation
of
regurgitation
in
a
double-blind
prospective
study
The
number
of
regurgitations
decreased
significantly
in
both
the
treatment
group
(the
formula
with
thickening
product
positional
treatment
parental
reassurance)
and
the
placebo
group
(the
same
formula
without
thickening
product
positional
treatment
parental
reassurance)
(P
0002
and
0032
respectively)
The
results
of
a
24-h
oesophageal
pH
monitoring
performed
before
and
during
treatment
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
the
percentage
of
time
oesophageal
pH
was
<
40
in
the
treatment
group
It
is
concluded
that
conservative
treatment
of
regurgitation
in
infants
consisting
mainly
of
parental
reassurance
and
postural
therapy
is
sufficient
to
obtain
clinical
remission
in
most
patients
In
addition
milk
thickening
products
tend
to
improve
clinical
remission
and
contribute
to
the
normalisation
of
some
pH
metric
parameters
