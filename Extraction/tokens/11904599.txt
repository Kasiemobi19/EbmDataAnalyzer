Accuracy
of
magnetic

imaging
and
transvaginal
ultrasonography
in
the
diagnosis
mapping
and
measurement
of
uterine
myomas
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
and
compare
the
accuracy
of
magnetic
resonance
imaging
and
transvaginal
ultrasonography
in
myoma
diagnosis
mapping
and
measurement
This
was
a
double-blind
study
of
106
consecutive
premenopausal
women
who
underwent
hysterectomy
for
benign
reasons
Myomas
(total
257)
were
exactly
mapped
by
magnetic
resonance
imaging
and
transvaginal
ultrasonography
in
each
patient
we
counted
correctly
identified
myomas
with
pathologic
position
as
true
value
The
presence
of
myomas
was
detected
with
the
same
high
level
of
precision
by
both
methods
(magnetic
resonance
imaging
sensitivity
099
specificity
086
transvaginal
ultrasonography
sensitivity
099
specificity
091)
The
mean
number
of
correctly
identified
myomas
was
significantly
higher
by
magnetic
resonance
imaging
than
by
transvaginal
ultrasonography
(mean
difference
051
+/-
103
P
<001)
a
difference
that
narrowed
to
008
+/-
076
(P
=60)
in
26
patients
with
1
to
4
myomas
and
uterine
volumes
<375
mL
Magnetic
resonance
imaging
and
transvaginal
ultrasonography
myoma
diameter
measurements
had
equal
and
high
accuracies
in
patients
with
1
to
4
myomas
Transvaginal
ultrasonography
is
as
efficient
as
magnetic
resonance
imaging
in
detecting
myoma
presence
but
its
capacity
for
exact
myoma
mapping
falls
short
of
that
of
magnetic
resonance
imaging
especially
in
large
(>375
mL)
multiple-myoma
(>4)
uteri
