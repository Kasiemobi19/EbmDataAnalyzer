Utility
of
a
short
screening
scale
for
DSM-IV
PTSD
in
primary
care
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
Breslau's
7-item
screen
for
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
(PTSD)
for
use
in
primary
care
One
hundred
and
thirty-four
patients
were
recruited
from
primary
care
clinics
at
a
large
medical
center
Participants
completed
the
self-administered
7-item
PTSD
screen
Later
psychologists
blinded
to
the
results
of
the
screen-interviewed
patients
using
the
Clinician
Administered
PTSD
Scale
(CAPS)
Sensitivity
specificity
and
likelihood
ratios
(LR)
were
calculated
using
the
CAPS
as
the
criterion
for
PTSD
The
screen
appears
to
have
test-retest
reliability
(r=84)
and
LRs
range
from
004
to
134
Screening
for
PTSD
in
primary
care
is
time
efficient
and
has
the
potential
to
increase
the
detection
of
previously
unrecognized
PTSD
