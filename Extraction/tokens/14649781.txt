Cognitive

for
obesity
one-year
follow-up
in
a
clinical
setting
Abstract
Text
Cognitive
behavioural
therapy
(CBT)
is
the
most
comprehensive
means
of
medically
treating
obesity
but
only
few
data
have
so
far
been
published
concerning
its
long-term
effectiveness
We
here
report
our
experience
of
1068
consecutive
patients
(868
females)
treated
with
CBT
at
a
university-based
obesity
centre
The
patients
were
enrolled
into
three
different
programmes
a
14-week
LEARN
programme
(672
patients)
a
16-week
MOB
programme
for
the
morbidly
obese
(259
patients)
or
a
20-week
BINGE
programme
for
subjects
affected
by
binge
eating
(137
patients)
Eighty-five
percent
of
the
subjects
completed
the
weekly
programmes
The
percentage
of
patients
attending
the
scheduled
control
visits
during
the
1-year
follow-up
gradually
decreased
being
very
low
in
the
BINGE
group
(10%)
The
percentage
weight
loss
was
an
average
of
6%
during
the
weekly
courses
being
higher
in
the
MOB
programme
by
the
end
of
the
weekly
sessions
it
exceeded
10%
of
initial
body
weight
in
22%
of
cases
and
increased
to
36%
during
the
follow-up
The
cumulative
probability
of
follow-up
was
higher
among
the
patients
undergoing
the
MOB
and
LEARN
programmes
than
among
the
BINGE
patients
(p
<
00001)
and
decreased
with
the
increasing
severity
of
obesity
Female
gender
and
a
weight
loss
of
>
10%
ibw
increased
compliance
to
follow-up
The
study
further
demonstrates
the
difficulty
of
achieving
compliance
to
chronic
management
of
obesity
and
the
critical
role
of
binge
eating
disorder
in
the
medium-term
treatment
of
obesity
Strategies
are
needed
to
improve
adherence
to
a
follow-up
protocol
