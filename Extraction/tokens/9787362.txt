Preseptal
and
orbital
cellulitis
in
childhood
A
changing
microbiologic
spectrum
Abstract
Text
The
authors
sought
to
determine
whether
the
microbiologic
spectrum
of
preseptal
and
orbital
cellulitis
had
changed
over
the
past
decade
A
retrospective
chart
review
of
all
inpatient
and
outpatient
children
with
an
ICD-9
diagnosis
of
preseptal
or
orbital
cellulitis
seen
at
Vanderbilt
University
Medical
Center
since
the
introduction
of
the
Haemophilus
influenzae
type-B
(HiB)
vaccine
(1986-1996)
Blood
and
abscess
cultures
from
children
with
preseptal
and
orbital
cellulitis
were
tabulated
During
this
period
70
cases
of
preseptal
cellulitis
were
seen
Blood
cultures
were
obtained
in
59
cases
only
6
were
positive
Five
cultures
grew
Streptococcus
species
The
one
positive
H
influenzae
culture
occurred
in
1987
in
a
child
who
did
not
receive
the
HiB
vaccine
There
have
been
no
new
patients
with
preseptal
cellulitis
and
H
influenzae
bacteremia
at
Vanderbilt
for
10
years
There
were
ten
cases
of
orbital
cellulitis
of
which
blood
or
abscess
or
both
were
cultured
in
eight
Six
cases
had
positive
cultures
Four
cultures
grew
Streptococcus
species
The
other
two
grew
H
influenzae
and
mixed
H
influenzae/gram-positive
cocci
The
incidence
of
hemophilus-associated
bacteremia
in
patients
with
preseptal
cellulitis
has
decreased
dramatically
over
the
past
10
years
Streptococcus
species
now
are
the
predominant
cause
Orbital
cellulitis
due
to
H
influenzae
may
still
occur
but
it
is
much
less
likely
A
more
conservative
approach
to
the
diagnosis
and
management
of
preseptal
and
orbital
cellulitis
may
be
warranted
