Abstract
Text
One
hundred
hyperactive
children
meeting
research
diagnostic
criteria
and
60
community
control
children
were
followed
prospectively
over
an
8-year
period
into
adolescence
Younger
(12-14
years)
and
older
(15-20
years)
groups
were
tested
on
measures
of
academic
skills
attention
and
impulse
control
and
select
frontal
lobe
functions
At
follow-up
hyperactive
Ss
demonstrated
impaired
academic
achievement
impaired
attention
and
impulse
control
and
greater
off-task
restless
and
vocal
behavior
during
an
academic
task
compared
with
control
Ss
The
limited
set
of
frontal
lobe
measures
did
not
differentiate
the
groups
Age
did
not
interact
with
group
membership
However
several
measures
showed
age-related
declines
in
both
groups
It
is
concluded
that
hyperactive
children
may
remain
chronically
impaired
in
academic
achievement
inattention
and
behavioral
disinhibition
well
into
their
late
adolescent
years
