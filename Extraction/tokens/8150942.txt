Asymptomatic
carriage
of
Neisseria
meningitidis
in
a
randomly
sampled
population
Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
extent
of
meningococcal
carriage
in
the
Norwegian
population
and
to
investigate
the
relationship
of
several
characteristics
of
the
population
to
the
carrier
state
1500
individuals
living
in
rural
and
small-town
areas
near
Oslo
were
selected
at
random
from
the
Norwegian
National
Population
Registry
These
persons
were
asked
to
complete
a
questionnaire
and
to
volunteer
for
a
bacteriological
tonsillopharyngeal
swab
sampling
Sixty-three
percent
of
the
selected
persons
participated
in
the
survey
Ninety-one
(96%)
of
the
volunteers
harbored
Neisseria
meningitidis
The
isolates
were
serogrouped
serotyped
tested
for
antibiotic
resistance
and
analyzed
by
multilocus
enzyme
electrophoresis
Eight
(88%)
of
the
91
isolates
represented
clones
of
the
two
clone
complexes
that
have
been
responsible
for
most
of
the
systemic
meningococal
disease
in
Norway
in
the
1980s
Age
between
15
and
24
male
sex
and
active
and
passive
smoking
were
found
to
be
independently
associated
with
meningococcal
carriage
in
logistic
regression
analyses
Working
outside
the
home
and
having
an
occupation
in
transportation
or
industry
also
increased
the
risk
for
meningococcal
carriage
in
individuals
older
than
17
when
corrections
for
gender
and
smoking
were
made
Assuming
that
our
sample
is
representative
of
the
Norwegian
population
we
estimated
that
about
40000
individuals
in
Norway
are
asymptomatic
carriers
of
isolates
with
epidemic
potential
Thus
carriage
eradication
among
close
contacts
of
persons
with
systemic
disease
is
unlikely
to
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
overall
epidemiological
situation
