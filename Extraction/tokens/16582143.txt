Abstract
Text
The
management
of
abnormal
cervical
cytology
in
adolescents
differs
from
that
for
the
adult
population
in
many
cases
Certain
characteristics
of
adolescents
may
warrant
special
management
considerations
It
is
important
to
avoid
aggressive
management
of
benign
lesions
in
adolescents
because
most
cervical
intraepithelial
neoplasia
grades
1
and
2
regress
Surgical
excision
or
destruction
of
cervical
tissue
in
a
nulliparous
adolescent
may
be
detrimental
to
future
fertility
and
cervical
competency
Care
should
be
given
to
minimize
destruction
of
normal
cervical
tissue
whenever
possible
A
compliant
health-conscious
adolescent
may
be
adequately
served
with
observation
in
many
situations
