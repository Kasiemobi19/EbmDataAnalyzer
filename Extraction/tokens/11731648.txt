C-reactive

febrile

Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
diagnostic
properties
of
quantitative
C-reactive
protein
(CRP)
associated
with
clinically
undetectable
serious
bacterial
infection
(SBI)
in
febrile
children
1
to
36
months
of
age
Febrile
children
presenting
to
a
pediatric
emergency
department
(ED)
with
ages
ranging
from
1
to
36
months
temperatures
>
or
=39
degrees
C
and
clinically
undetectable
source
of
fever
were
enrolled
in
this
prospective
cohort
study
Demographic
information
ED
temperature
duration
of
fever
and
clinical
evaluation
using
the
Yale
observation
scale
were
recorded
at
the
time
of
the
initial
evaluation
The
white
blood
cell
count
(WBC)
band
count
absolute
neutrophil
count
(ANC)
and
CRP
concentration
were
measured
at
the
same
time
All
patients
received
blood
cultures
and
either
a
screening
urinalysis
or
urine
culture
A
chest
radiograph
was
obtained
at
the
discretion
of
the
ED
physician
Patients
with
history
of
using
antibiotics
within
1
week
of
their
presentation
to
the
ED
were
excluded
The
main
outcome
result
was
the
presence
of
laboratory
or
radiographically
proven
SBI
(bacteremia
meningitis
urinary
tract
infection
pneumonia
septic
arthritis
and
osteomyelitis)
Seventy-seven
patients
were
enrolled
in
the
study
Fourteen
(18%)
had
a
SBI
(6
urinary
tract
infection
4
pneumonia
including
1
patient
with
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
bacteremia
and
4
occult
S
pneumoniae
bacteremia)
and
63
had
no
SBI
The
2
groups
were
indistinguishable
in
age
sex
ED
temperature
duration
of
fever
and
Yale
observation
scale
CRP
concentration
WBC
and
ANC
were
significantly
different
between
the
2
groups
In
a
multivariate
logistic
regression
analysis
only
CRP
remained
as
a
predictor
of
SBI
(Beta

interval
[CI]

Receiver-operating
characteristic
analysis
demonstrated
CRP
(area

[SE]

to
be
superior
to
ANC
(AUC

and
to
WBC
(AUC

SE
0068
95%
CI
0628
0895)
A
CRP
cutoff
point
of
7
was
determined
to
maximize
both
sensitivity
and
specificity
(sensitivity

specificity
91%

ratio

95%

Multilevel
likelihood
ratios
and
posttest
probabilities
were
calculated
for
a
variety
of
CRP
levels
A
CRP
concentration
of
<5
mg/dL
effectively
ruled
out
SBI
(likelihood
ratio

CI

posttest

SBI

Quantitative
CRP
concentration
is
a
valuable
laboratory
test
in
the
evaluation
of
febrile
young
children
who
are
at
risk
for
occult
bacteremia
and
SBI
with
a
better
predictive
value
than
the
WBC
or
ANC
