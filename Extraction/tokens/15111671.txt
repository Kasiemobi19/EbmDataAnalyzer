Abstract
Text
To
analyze
the
prevalence
and
demography
of
chronic
daily
headache
(CDH)
with
analgesic
overuse
A
population
of
9984
inhabitants
aged
14
or
older
living
in
Santoña
Spain
was
studied
The
authors
personally
interviewed
4855
subjects
using
a
quota
sampling
approach
Those
with
headache
for
>
or
=
10
days/month
and
some
analgesic
use
were
asked
to
fill
in
a
diary
over
the
course
of
1
month
Then
subjects
were
classified
into
CDH
with
or
without
analgesic
overuse
subtypes
Quality
of
life
(Short
Form-36
Health
Survey
[SF-36])
was
also
assessed
in
this
second
interview
Headache
for
>
or
=
10
days/month
with
analgesic
consumption
was
reported
by
332
subjects
Seven
had
secondary
headache
Seventy-four
(standardized
prevalence
141%
95%
CI
11
to
18)
fulfilled
criteria
for
CDH
with
analgesic
overuse
Prevalence
in
women
(26%
20
to
33)
was
much
higher
than
in
men
(019%
0006
to
052)
Mean
age
was
56
years
(range
19
to
82
years)
As
recalled
by
the
subjects
the
mean
age
at
onset
of
CDH
was
38
years
(range
9
to
82
years)
whereas
the
mean
age
at
onset
of
CDH
with
frequent
analgesic
consumption
was
45
years
(range
19
to
80
years)
and
that
of
primary
headache
was
22
years
(range
5
to
60
years)
CDH
subjects
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
each
SF-36
health-related
score
as
compared
with
healthy
control
subjects
Transformed
migraine
was
diagnosed
in
49
(prevalence
09%)
chronic
tension-type
headache
in
20
(04%)
and
new
daily
persistent
headache
in
5
(01%)
Thirty-five
percent
of
patients
overused
simple
analgesics
22%
ergotics
125%
opioids
and
27%
triptans
the
remaining
278%
were
overusing
different
combinations
CDH
with
analgesic
overuse
is
a
common
disorder
in
the
general
population
mainly
in
women
in
their
fifties
in
whom
5%
meet
its
diagnostic
criteria
