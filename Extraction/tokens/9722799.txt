A
comparison
of
the
efficacy
of
fluticasone
propionate
aqueous
nasal
spray
and
loratadine
alone
and
in
combination
for
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
rhinitis
Abstract
Text
Intranasal
corticosteroids
and
oral
antihistamines
are
both
effective
in
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
rhinitis
although
the
therapeutic
value
of
administering
the
two
types
of
agents
concurrently
has
rarely
been
evaluated
This
study
was
designed
to
compared
the
efficacy
safety
and
impact
on
quality
of
life
of
fluticasone
propionate
aqueous
nasal
spray
(FP
ANS)
loratadine
FP
ANS
plus
loratadine
and
placebo
(an
aqueous
nasal
spray
plus
tablet)
in
the
treatment
of
seasonal
allergic
rhinitis
during
the
mountain
cedar
allergy
season
in
south
central
Texas
Six
hundred
patients
with
seasonal
allergic
rhinitis
were
treated
for
2
weeks
with
either
FP
ANS
200
microgram
once

loratadine
10
mg
once
daily
the
FP
ANS
and
loratadine
regimens
combined
or
placebo
in
a
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
double-dummy
parallel-group
study
Clinician-
and
patient-rated
total
and
individual
nasal
symptom
scores
after
7
and
14
days
of
therapy
and
overall
evaluations
were
significantly
lower
(P
<
001)
in
the
FP
ANS
and
FP
ANS
plus
loratadine
groups
compared
with
the
loratadine
only
and
placebo
groups
Loratadine
was
not
statistically
different
from
placebo
in
clinician
and
patient
symptom
score
ratings
nor
in
overall
clinician
and
patient
evaluations
FP
ANS
plus
loratadine
and
FP
ANS
monotherapy
were
comparable
in
efficacy
in
almost
all
evaluations
for
some
patient-rated
symptoms
the
combination
was
found
superior
Mean
score
changes
in
the
Rhinoconjunctivitis
Quality
of
Life
Questionnaire
from
baseline
to
day
14
showed
significantly
greater
improvement
(P
<
001)
in
quality
of
life
in
the
FP
ANS
group
than
in
the
group
of
patients
receiving
loratadine
only
or
placebo
and
no
significant
benefit
was
demonstrated
in
the
FP
ANS
plus
loratadine
group
over
the
FP
ANS
monotherapy
group
No
serious
or
unusual
drug-related
adverse
events
were
reported
Combining
loratadine
with
FP
ANS
did
not
alter
the
adverse
events
profile
or
frequency
