Thickening
of
infant
feedings
for
therapy
of
gastroesophageal
reflux
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
effect
of
thickening
of
feedings
on
gastroesophageal
reflux
and
gastric
emptying
20
infants
were
examined
with
technetium
scintigraphy
and
detailed
behavioral
observation
after
each
of
a
pair
of
feedings
one
with
radiolabeled
infant
formula
alone
and
the
other
with
radiolabeled
formula
thickened
with
dry
rice
cereal
The
thickened
and
unthickened
meals
were
followed
by
similar
amounts
of
scintigraphically
demonstrated
gastroesophageal
reflux
However
the
number
of
episodes
of
emesis
(12
+/-
07
vs
39
+/-
09
per
90
minutes
postprandial)
the
percent
of
gastric
emptying
at
30
minutes
(178%
+/-
27%
vs
224%
+/-
24%)
the
time
spent
crying
(117
+/-
31
minutes
vs
176
+/-
38
minutes
per
90
minutes)
and
the
total
time
spent
awake
(452
+/-
59
minutes
vs
531
+/-
49
minutes
per
90
minutes)
were
significantly
less
after
the
thickened
feedings
Because
thickening
of
infant
feedings
increases
the
caloric
density
decreases
emesis
decreases
crying
time
and
increases
sleep
time
in
the
postprandial
period
it
is
likely
to
be
beneficial
in
the
treatment
of
infants
with
gastroesophageal
reflux
associated
with
failure
to
thrive
