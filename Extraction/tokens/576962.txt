Title
Oral
contraceptives
and
blood
pressure
Abstract
Text
Both
cross-sectional
and
longitudinal
analysis
of
data
from
13358
women
showed
that
oral
contraceptive
use
is
associated
with
a
slight
but
statistically
significant
(P
lesser
than
05)
rise
in
mean
blood
pressure
which
is
reversible
The
age-adjusted
proportion
of
oral
contraceptive
users
with
a
blood
pressure
over
140/90
mm
Hg
was
about
three
times
that
on
nonusers
These
findings
are
caused
by
a
uniform
upward
shift
in
the
blood
pressure
distribution
of
oral
contraceptive
users
compared
to
nonusers
Women
continuing
oral
contraceptive
use
had
no
appreciably
greater
change
in
blood
pressure
between
two
visits
than
persistent
nonusers
The
clinical
implications
of
a
mild
contraceptive-induced
blood
pressure
elevation
(systolic
5
to
6
mm
Hg
diastolic
1
to
2
mm
Hg)
remain
unsettled
but
disturbing
