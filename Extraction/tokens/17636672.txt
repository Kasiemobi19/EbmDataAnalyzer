Topical
treatments
for
fungal
infections
of
the
skin
and
nails
of
the
foot
Abstract
Text
Fungal
infections
of
the
feet
normally
occur
in
the
outermost
layer
of
the
skin
(epidermis)
The
skin
between
the
toes
is
a
frequent
site
of
infection
which
can
cause
pain
and
itchiness
Fungal
infections
of
the
nail
(onychomycosis)
can
affect
the
entire
nail
plate
To
assess
the
effects
of
topical
treatments
in
successfully
treating
(rate
of
treatment
failure)
fungal
infections
of
the
skin
of
the
feet
and
toenails
and
in
preventing
recurrence
We
searched

Randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
using
participants
who
had
mycologically
diagnosed
fungal
infections
of
the
skin
and
nails
of
the
foot
Two
authors
independently
summarised
the
included
trials
and
appraised
their
quality
of
reporting
using
a
structured
data
extraction
tool
Of
the
144
identified
papers
67
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Placebo-controlled
trials
yielded
the
following
pooled
risk
ratios
(RR)
of
treatment
failure
for
skin
infections
allylamines
RR
033
(95%
CI
024
to
044)
azoles
RR
030
(95%
CI
020
to
045)
ciclopiroxolamine
RR
027
(95%
CI
011
to
066)
tolnaftate
RR
019
(95%
CI
008
to
044)
butenafine
RR
033
(95%
CI
024
to
045)
undecanoates
RR
029
(95%
CI
012
-
070)
Meta-analysis
of
11
trials
comparing
allylamines
and
azoles
showed
a
risk
ratio
of
treatment
failure
RR
063
(95%
CI
042
to
094)
in
favour
of
allylamines
Evidence
for
the
management
of
topical
treatments
for
infections
of
the
toenails
is
sparser
There
is
some
evidence
that
ciclopiroxolamine
and
butenafine
are
both
effective
but
they
both
need
to
be
applied
daily
for
prolonged
periods
(at
least
1
year)
The
6
trials
of
nail
infections
provided
evidence
that
topical
ciclopiroxolamine
has
poor
cure
rates
and
that
amorolfine
might
be
substantially
more
effective
but
more
research
is
required
Placebo-controlled
trials
of
allylamines
and
azoles
for
athlete's
foot
consistently
produce
much
higher
percentages
of
cure
than
placebo
Allylamines
cure
slightly
more
infections
than
azoles
and
are
now
available
OTC
Further
research
into
the
effectiveness
of
antifungal
agents
for
nail
infections
is
required
