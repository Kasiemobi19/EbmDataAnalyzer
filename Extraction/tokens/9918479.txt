Safety
of
revaccination
with
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
Abstract
Text
Revaccination
of
healthy
adults
with
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
(PPV)
within
several
years
of
first
vaccination
has
been
associated
with
a
higher
than
expected
frequency
and
severity
of
local
injection
site
reactions
The
risk
of
adverse
events
associated
with
revaccination
of
elderly
and
chronically
ill
persons
5
or
more
years
after
first
vaccination
as
is
currently
recommended
has
not
been
well
defined
To
determine
whether
revaccination
with
PPV
at
least
5
years
after
first
vaccination
is
associated
with
more
frequent
or
more
serious
adverse
events
than
those
following
first
vaccination
Comparative
intervention
study
conducted
between
April
1996
and
August
1997
Persons
aged
50
to
74
years
either
who
had
never
been
vaccinated
with
PPV
(n
=
901)
or
who
had
been
vaccinated
once
at
least
5
years
prior
to
enrollment
(n
=
513)
PPV
vaccination
Postvaccination
local
injection
site
reactions
and
prevaccination
concentrations
of
type-specific
antibodies
Those
who
were
revaccinated
were
more
likely
than
those
who
received
their
first
vaccinations
to
report
a
local
injection
site
reaction
of
at
least
102
cm
(4
in)
in
diameter
within
2
days
of
vaccination
11%
(55/513)
vs
3%
(29/901)
(relative
risk
[RR]
33
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
21-51)
These
reactions
resolved
by
a
median
of
3
days
following
vaccination
The
highest
rate
was
among
revaccinated
patients
who
were
immunocompetent
and
did
not
have
chronic
illness
15%
(33/228)
compared
with
3%
(10/337)
among
comparable
patients
receiving
their
first
vaccinations
(RR
49
95%
CI
24-97)
The
risk
of
these
local
reactions
was
significantly
correlated
with
prevaccination
geometric
mean
antibody
concentrations
Physicians
and
patients
should
be
aware
that
self-limited
local
injection
site
reactions
occur
more
frequently
following
revaccination
compared
with
first
vaccination
however
this
risk
does
not
represent
a
contraindication
to
revaccination
with
PPV
for
recommended
groups
