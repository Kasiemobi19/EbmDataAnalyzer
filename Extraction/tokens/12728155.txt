study
Abstract
Text
In
the
assessment
of
severity
in
community
acquired
pneumonia
(CAP)
the
modified
British
Thoracic
Society
(mBTS)
rule
identifies
patients
with
severe
pneumonia
but
not
patients
who
might
be
suitable
for
home
management
A
multicentre
study
was
conducted
to
derive
and
validate
a
practical
severity
assessment
model
for
stratifying
adults
hospitalised
with
CAP
into
different
management
groups
Data
from
three
prospective
studies
of
CAP
conducted
in
the
UK
New
Zealand
and
the
Netherlands
were
combined
A
derivation
cohort
comprising
80%
of
the
data
was
used
to
develop
the
model
Prognostic
variables
were
identified
using
multiple
logistic
regression
with
30
day
mortality
as
the
outcome
measure
The
final
model
was
tested
against
the
validation
cohort
1068

A
