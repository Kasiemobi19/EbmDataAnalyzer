Laboratory
evaluation
of
acute
upper
genital
tract
infection
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
diagnostic
test
characteristics
of
common
tests
used
to
diagnose
upper
genital
tract
infection
Subjects
included
women
who
either
met
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention's
minimal
criteria
for
acute
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
or
who
had
other
signs
of
upper
genital
tract
infection
(ie
atypical
pelvic
pain
abnormal
uterine
bleeding
or
cervicitis)
The
subjects
were
evaluated
with
a
baseline
interview
comprehensive
laboratory
testing
and
either
an
endometrial
biopsy
or
laparoscopy
for
definitive
diagnosis
of
upper
genital
tract
infection
Patients
were
considered
positive
for
upper
genital
tract
infection
if
they
had
any
of
the
following
findings
1)
histologic
evidence
of
acute
endometriosis
or
salpingitis
2)
laparoscopic
visualization
of
purulent
exudate
in
the
pelvis
without
another
source
or
3)
positive
testing
for
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
or
Chlamydia
trachomatis
from
the
endometrium
fallopian
tubes
or
pelvis
One
hundred
twenty
women
with
adequate
endometrial
samples
were
evaluated
between
August
1993
and
September
1995
The
median
age
of
the
study
population
was
24
years
38%
were
white
52%
were
smokers
81%
were
insured
by
Medicaid
or
were
uninsured
and
67%
were
single
Sensitivities
for
elevated
white
blood
cell
count
(WBC)
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
C-reactive
protein
and
increased
vaginal
white
blood
cells
are
57
70
71
and
78%
respectively
If
any
one
test
is
abnormal
the
sensitivity
is
100%
and
specificity
is
18%
If
all
four
tests
are
abnormal
sensitivity
is
29%
and
specificity
is
95%
Testing
for
increased
vaginal
white
blood
cells
was
found
to
be
the
most
sensitive
laboratory
indicator
for
upper
genital
tract
infection
whereas
serum
WBC
was
the
most
specific
No
one
diagnostic
laboratory
test
is
pathognomonic
for
upper
genital
tract
infection
Combinations
of
positive
tests
can
improve
diagnostic
specificity
and
positive
predictive
value
but
with
a
diminution
of
sensitivity
and
negative
predictive
value
Combinations
of
negative
tests
can
reliably
exclude
upper
genital
tract
infection
