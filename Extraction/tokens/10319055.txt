Evaluation
and
outcome
of
patients
with
chronic
non-productive
cough
using
a
comprehensive
diagnostic
protocol
Abstract
Text
Asthma
post-nasal
drip
syndrome
(PNDS)
and
gastro-oesophageal
reflux
(GOR)
account
for
many
cases
of
chronic
non-productive
cough
(CNPC)
Each
may
simultaneously
contribute
to
cough
even
when
clinically
silent
and
failure
to
recognise
their
contribution
may
lead
to
unsuccessful
treatment
Patients
(all
lifetime
non-smokers
with
normal
chest
radiographs
and
spirometric
measurements)
referred
with
CNPC
persisting
for
more
than
three
weeks
as
their
sole
respiratory
symptom
underwent
histamine
challenge
home
peak
flow
measurements
ear
nose
and
throat
(ENT)
examination
sinus
CT
scanning
and
24
hour
oesophageal
pH
monitoring
Treatment
was
prescribed
on
the
basis
of
diagnoses
informed
by
investigation
results
Forty
three
patients
(29
women)
of
mean
age
475
years
(range
18-77)
and
mean
cough
duration
67
months
(range
2-240)
were
evaluated
On
the
basis
of
a
successful
response
to
treatment
a
cause
for
the
cough
was
identified
in
35
patients
(82%)
as
follows
cough
variant
asthma
(CVA)
(10
cases)
PNDS
(9
cases)
GOR
(8
cases)
and
dual
aetiologies
(8
cases)
Histamine
challenge
correctly
predicted
CVA
in
15
of
17
(88%)
positive
tests
ENT
examination
and
sinus
CT
scans
each
had
low
positive
predictive
values
for
PNDS
(10
of
16
(63%)
and
12
of
18
(67%)
positive
cases
respectively)
suggesting
that
upper
airways
disease
frequently
co-exists
but
does
not
always
contribute
to
cough
When
negative
histamine
challenge
and
24
hour
oesophageal
pH
monitoring
effectively
ruled
out
CVA
and
GOR
respectively
as
a
cause
for
cough
This
comprehensive
approach
aids
the
accurate
direction
of
treatment
and
while
CVA
PNDS
and
GOR
remain
the
most
important
causes
of
CNPC
to
consider
a
group
with
no
identifiable
aetiology
remains
