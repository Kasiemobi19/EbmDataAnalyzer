Clinical
response
and
risk
for
reported
suicidal
ideation
and
suicide
attempts
in
pediatric
antidepressant
treatment
a
meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
Abstract
Text
The
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
has
issued
warnings
that
use
of
antidepressant
medications
poses
a
small
but
significantly
increased
risk
of
suicidal
ideation/suicide
attempt
for
children
and
adolescents
To
assess
the
efficacy
and
risk
of
reported
suicidal
ideation/suicide
attempt
of
antidepressants
for
treatment
of
pediatric
major
depressive
disorder
(MDD)
obsessive-compulsive
disorder
(OCD)
and
non-OCD
anxiety
disorders

randomized

of

in
participants
younger

with

Information
was
extracted

and
spontaneously
reported
suicidal

attempt
Twenty-seven
trials
of
pediatric
MDD
(n
=
15)
OCD
(n
=
6)
and
non-OCD
anxiety
disorders
(n
=
6)
were
selected
and
risk
differences
for
response
and
for
suicidal
ideation/suicide
attempt
estimated
by
random-effects
methods
Pooled
risk
differences
in
rates
of
primary
study-defined
measures
of
responder
status
significantly
favored
antidepressants
for
MDD
(110%
[95%
confidence
interval
{CI}
71%
to
149%])
OCD
(198%
[95%
CI
130%
to
266%)
and
non-OCD
anxiety
disorders
(371%
[225%
to
517%])
corresponding
to
a
number
needed
to
treat
(NNT)
of
10
(95%
CI
7
to
15)
6
(4
to

and
3
(2
to

respectively
While
there
was
increased
risk
difference
of
suicidal
ideation/suicide
attempt
across
all
trials
and
indications
for
drug
vs
placebo
(07%
95%
CI
01%
to
13%)
(number
needed
to
harm
143
[95%
CI
77
to
1000])
the
pooled
risk
differences
within
each
indication
were
not
statistically
significant
09%
(95%
CI
-01%
to
19%)
for
MDD
05%
(-12%
to
22%)
for
OCD
and
07%
(-04%
to
18%)
for
non-OCD
anxiety
disorders
There
were
no
completed
suicides
Age-stratified
analyses
showed
that
for
children
younger
than
12
years
with
MDD
only
fluoxetine
showed
benefit
over
placebo
In
MDD
trials
efficacy
was
moderated
by
age
duration
of
depression
and
number
of
sites
in
the
treatment
trial
Relative
to
placebo
antidepressants
are
efficacious
for
pediatric
MDD
OCD
and
non-OCD
anxiety
disorders
although
the
effects
are
strongest
in
non-OCD
anxiety
disorders
intermediate
in
OCD
and
more
modest
in
MDD
Benefits
of
antidepressants
appear
to
be
much
greater
than
risks
from
suicidal
ideation/suicide
attempt
across
indications
although
comparison
of
benefit
to
risk
varies
as
a
function
of
indication
age
chronicity
and
study
conditions
