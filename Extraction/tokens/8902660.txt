The

treatment

an
update

attempt

statistical

Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effectiveness
of
chiropractic
treatment
for
patients
with
low
back
pain
by
means
of
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
Randomized
clinical
trials
(RCTs)
on
chiropractic
were
identified
with
a
Medline
and
Embase
search
(1966-1995)
by
citation
tracking
and
by
hand
searching
of
the
relevant
chiropractic
reference
systems
(CRAC
and
Index
to
Chiropractic
Literature)
All
RCTs
on
low
back
pain
that
involved
chiropractors
as
therapists
Methodological
quality
was
assessed
independently
by
two
reviewers
on
14
items
covering
internal
validity
informativeness
and
study
size
Data
were
extracted
on
patients
(initial
referral
duration
of
complaints
radiation
of
pain)
outcomes
(four
different
types)
and
timing
of
follow-up
(short-term
intermediate
and
long-term)
Statistical
pooling
was
intended
according
to
a
preset
analysis
plan
to
include
subgroup
analysis
Eight
RCTs
were
identified
All
RCTs
had
serious
flaws
in
their
design
execution
and
reporting
Because
of
the
great
variety
of
outcome
measures
and
follow-up
timing
there
was
insufficient
data
to
enable
statistical
pooling
of
the
RCTs
A
narrative
review
however
did
not
provide
convincing
evidence
for
the
effectiveness
of
chiropractic
for
acute
or
chronic
low
back
pain
There
is
certainly
a
need
for
correctly
executed
trials
In
future
research
on
the
effectiveness
of
chiropractic
guidelines
for
uniform
execution
and
reporting
of
RCTs
should
first
be
established
to
enable
subsequent
statistical
pooling
in
systematic
reviews
of
chiropractic
trials
