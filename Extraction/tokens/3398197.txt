Prevalence

Abstract
Text
Although
fatigue
is
one
of
the
most
common
complaints
in
ambulatory
care
research
has
been
minimal
Of
the
1159
consecutive
patients
surveyed
in
two
adult
primary-care
clinics
276
(24%)
indicated
that
fatigue
was
a
major
problem
Fatigue
was
more
prevalent
in
women
than
in
men
(28%
vs
19%)
Extensive
clinical
laboratory
psychometric
and
functional
data
were
gathered
for
102
fatigued
patients
and
26
controls
Laboratory
testing
was
not
useful
in
detecting
unsuspected
medical
conditions
or
in
determining
the
cause
of
fatigue
Depression
or
somatic
anxiety
or
both
were
suggested
by
screening
psychometric
instruments
in
82
fatigued
patients
(80%)
compared
with
three
controls
(12%)
Global
dysfunction
was
marked
as
reported
by
patients
on
the
Sickness
Impact
Profile
The
mean
score
on
the
Sickness
Impact
Profile
of
113
for
fatigued
patients
is
similar
to
that
reported
for
patients
with
major
medical
illnesses
After
one
year
of
follow-up
only
29
fatigued
patients
(28%)
had
improved
The
high
prevalence
persistence
and
functional
consequences
of
fatigue
mandate
a
search
for
effective
therapy
