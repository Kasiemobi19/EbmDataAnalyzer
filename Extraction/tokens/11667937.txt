Universal

hearing
screening
summary

evidence
Abstract
Text
Each
year
approximately
5000
infants
are
born
in
the
United
States
with
moderate-to-profound
bilateral
permanent
hearing
loss
(PHL)
Universal
newborn
hearing
screening
(UNHS)
has
been
proposed
as
a
means
to
speed
diagnosis
and
treatment
and
thereby
improve
language
outcomes
in
these
children
To
identify
strengths
weaknesses
and
gaps
in
the
evidence
supporting
UNHS
and
to
compare
the
additional
benefits
and
harms
of
UNHS
with
those
of
selective
screening
of
high-risk
newborns
We
searched
the
MEDLINE
CINAHL
and
PsychINFO
databases
for
relevant
articles
published
from
1994
to
August
2001
using
terms
for
hearing
disorders
infants
or
newborns
screening
and
relevant
treatments
We
contacted
experts
and
reviewed
reference
lists
to
identify
additional
articles
including
those
published
before
1994
We
included
controlled
and
observational
studies
of
(1)
the
accuracy
yield
and
harms
of
screening
using
otoacoustic
emissions
(OAEs)
auditory
brainstem
response
(ABR)
or
both
in
the
general
newborn
population
and
(2)
the
effects
of
screening
or
early
identification
and
treatment
on
language
outcomes
Of
an
original
340
articles
identified
19
articles
including
1
controlled
trial
met
these
inclusion
criteria
Data
on
population
test
performance
outcomes
and
methodological
quality
were
extracted
by
2
authors
(DCT
HM)
using
prespecified
criteria
developed
by
the
US
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
We
queried
authors
when
information
needed
to
assess
study
quality
was
missing
Good-quality
studies
show
that
from
2041
to
2794
low-risk
and
86
to
208
high-risk
newborns
were
screened
to
find
1
case
of
moderate-to-profound
PHL
The
best
estimate
of
positive
predictive
value
was
67%
Six
percent
to
15%
of
infants
who
are
missed
by
the
screening
tests
are
subsequently
diagnosed
with
bilateral
PHL
In
a
trial
of
UNHS
vs
clinical
screening
at
age
8
months
UNHS
increased
the
proportion
of
infants
with
moderate-to-severe
hearing
loss
diagnosed
by
age
10
months
(57%
vs
14%)
but
did
not
reduce
the
rate
of
diagnosis
after
age
18
months
No
good-quality
controlled
study
has
compared
UNHS
with
selective
screening
of
high-risk
newborns
In
fair-
to
poor-quality
cohort
studies
intervention
before
age
6
months
was
associated
with
improved
language
and
communication
skills
by
ages
2
to
5
years
These
studies
had
unclear
criteria
for
selecting
subjects
and
none
compared
an
inception
cohort
of
low-risk
newborns
identified
by
screening
with
those
identified
in
usual
care
making
it
impossible
to
exclude
selection
bias
as
an
explanation
for
the
results
In
a
mathematical
model
based
on
the
literature
review
we
estimated
that
extending
screening
to
low-risk
infants
would
detect
1
additional
case
before
age
10
months
for
every
1441
low-risk
infants
screened
and
result
in
treatment
before
10
months
of
1
additional
case
for
every
2401
low-risk
infants
screened
With
UNHS
254
newborns
would
be
referred
for
audiological
evaluation
because
of
false-positive
second-stage
screening
test
results
vs
48
for
selective
screening
Modern
screening
tests
for
hearing
impairment
can
improve
identification
of
newborns
with
PHL
but
the
efficacy
of
UNHS
to
improve
long-term
language
outcomes
remains
uncertain
