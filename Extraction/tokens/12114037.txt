Study
of
antioxidant

in
20536
high-risk

a
randomised
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
It
has
been
suggested
that
increased
intake
of
various
antioxidant
vitamins
reduces
the
incidence
rates
of
vascular
disease
cancer
and
other
adverse
outcomes
20536
UK
adults
(aged
40-80)
with
coronary
disease
other
occlusive
arterial
disease
or
diabetes
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
antioxidant
vitamin
supplementation
(600
mg
vitamin
E
250
mg
vitamin
C
and
20
mg
beta-carotene
daily)
or
matching
placebo
Intention-to-treat
comparisons
of
outcome
were
conducted
between
all
vitamin-allocated
and
all
placebo-allocated
participants
An
average
of
83%
of
participants
in
each
treatment
group
remained
compliant
during
the
scheduled
5-year
treatment
period
Allocation
to
this
vitamin
regimen
approximately
doubled
the
plasma
concentration
of
alpha-tocopherol
increased
that
of
vitamin
C
by
one-third
and
quadrupled
that
of
beta-carotene
Primary
outcomes
were
major
coronary
events
(for
overall
analyses)
and
fatal
or
non-fatal
vascular
events
(for
subcategory
analyses)
with
subsidiary
assessments
of
cancer
and
of
other
major
morbidity
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
all-cause
mortality
(1446
[141%]
vitamin-allocated
vs
1389
[135%]
placebo-allocated)
or
in
deaths
due
to
vascular
(878
[86%]
vs
840
[82%])
or
non-vascular
(568
[55%]
vs
549
[53%])
causes
Nor
were
there
any
significant
differences
in
the
numbers
of
participants
having
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
or
coronary
death
(1063
[104%]
vs
1047
[102%])
non-fatal
or
fatal
stroke
(511
[50%]
vs
518
[50%])
or
coronary
or
non-coronary
revascularisation
(1058
[103%]
vs
1086
[106%])
For
the
first
occurrence
of
any
of
these
"major
vascular
events"
there
were
no
material
differences
either
overall
(2306
[225%]
vs
2312
[225%]
event
rate
ratio
100
[95%
CI
094-106])
or
in
any
of
the
various
subcategories
considered
There
were
no
significant
effects
on
cancer
incidence
or
on
hospitalisation
for
any
other
non-vascular
cause
Among
the
high-risk
individuals
that
were
studied
these
antioxidant
vitamins
appeared
to
be
safe
But
although
this
regimen
increased
blood
vitamin
concentrations
substantially
it
did
not
produce
any
significant
reductions
in
the
5-year
mortality
from
or
incidence
of
any
type
of
vascular
disease
cancer
or
other
major
outcome
