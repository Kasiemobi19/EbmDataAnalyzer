an
emerging
safe
and
effective
treatment
for
atopic
dermatitis
Abstract
Text
SDZ
ASM
981
is
a
selective
inhibitor
of
the
production
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
from
T
cells
and
mast
cells
in
vitro
It
is
the
first
ascomycin
macrolactam
derivative
under
development
for
the
treatment
of
inflammatory
skin
diseases
This
study
was
designed
to
determine
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
SDZ
ASM
981
cream
at
concentrations
of
005%
02%
06%
and
10%
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
atopic
dermatitis
and
to
select
the
concentration
to
be
used
in
phase
III
studies
This
was
a
double-blind
randomized
parallel-group
multicentre
dose-finding
study
A
total
of
260
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
treatment
with
SDZ
ASM
981
cream
at
concentrations
of
005%
02%
06%
or
10%
matching
vehicle
cream
or
the
internal
control
01%
betamethasone-17-valerate
cream
(BMV)
Treatment
was
given
twice
daily
for
up
to
3
weeks
A
clear
dose-response
relationship
for
SDZ
ASM
981
was
evident
with
02%
06%
and
10%
SDZ
ASM
981
creams
all
being
significantly
more
effective
than
vehicle
(P
=
0041
0001
and
0008
respectively)
in
terms
of
baseline
to
end-point
changes
in
the
Eczema
Area
Severity
Index
(EASI)
and
pruritus
score
The
10%
cream
was
the
most
effective
SDZ
ASM
981
concentration
BMV
was
more
effective
than
the
SDZ
ASM
981
creams
tested
in
this
study
It
appears
that
the
efficacy
plateau
was
not
reached
with
the
SDZ
ASM
981
creams
within
3
weeks
treatment
SDZ
ASM
981
was
well
tolerated
Burning
or
a
feeling
of
warmth
were
the
only
adverse
events
reported
more
frequently
in
the
06%
and
10%
SDZ
ASM
981
treatment
groups
than
in
the
vehicle
treatment
group
(429%
489%
and
349%
respectively)
Few
systemic
adverse
events
were
reported
during
the
study
(headache
was
the
most
frequent
systemic
event
reported
by
15
of
252
patients)
and
none
was
considered
to
be
related
to
treatment
The
local
tolerability
profile
of
the
10%
cream
was
similar
to
that
of
the
lower
concentrations
10%
SDZ
ASM
981
cream
which
was
shown
to
be
safe
well
tolerated
and
the
most
effective
concentration
in
this
study
was
selected
as
the
concentration
to
be
further
developed
in
phase
III
studies
