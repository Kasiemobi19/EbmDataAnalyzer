Abstract
Text
Women
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS)
are
characterized
by
defects
in
insulin
action
insulin
secretion
ovarian
steroidogenesis
and
fibrinolysis
We
administered
the
insulin-sensitizing
agent
troglitazone
to
13
obese
women
with
PCOS
and
impaired
glucose
tolerance
to
determine
whether
attenuation
of
hyperinsulinemia
ameliorates
these
defects
All
subjects
had
oligomenorrhea
hirsutism
polycystic
ovaries
and
hyperandrogenemia
Before
and
after
treatment
with
troglitazone
(400
mg
daily
for
12
weeks)
all
had
1)
a
GnRH
agonist
(leuprolide)
test
2)
a
75-g
oral
glucose
tolerance
test
3)
a
frequently
sampled
iv
glucose
tolerance
test
to
determine
the
insulin
sensitivity
index
and
the
acute
insulin
response
to
glucose
4)
an
oscillatory
glucose
infusion
to
assess
the
ability
of
the
beta-cell
to
entrain
to
glucose
as
quantitated
by
the
normalized
spectral
power
for
the
insulin
secretion
rate
and
5)
measures
of
fibrinolytic
capacity
[plasminogen
activator
inhibitor
type
1
(PAI-1)
and
tissue
plasminogen
activator]
There
was
no
change
in
body
mass
index
(399
+/-
14
vs
402
+/-
14
kg/m2)
or
body
fat
distribution
after
treatment
Both
the
fasting
(91
+/-
3
vs
103
+/-
3
mg/dL
P
<
0001)
and
2
h
(146
+/-
8
vs
171
+/-
6
mg/dL
P
<
002)
plasma
glucose
concentrations
during
the
oral
glucose
tolerance
test
declined
significantly
There
was
a
concordant
reduction
in
glycosylated
hemoglobin
to
57
+/-
01
from
a
pretreatment
level
of
61
+/-
01%
(P
<
003)
Insulin
sensitivity
increased
from
058
+/-
014
to
095
+/-
026
10(-5)
min-1/pmolL
(P
<
001)
after
treatment
as
did
the
disposition
index
(745
+/-
135
vs
381
+/-
96
P
<
005)
The
ability
of
the
beta-cell
to
appropriately
detect
and
respond
to
an
oscillatory
glucose
infusion
improved
significantly
after
troglitazone
treatment
the
normalized
spectral
power
for
the
insulin
secretion
rate
increased
to
59
+/-
11
from
43
+/-
08
(P
<
005)
Basal
levels
of
total
testosterone
(1093
+/-
152
vs
794
+/-
98
ng/dL
P
<
005)
and
free
testosterone
(333
+/-
40
vs
212
+/-
26
pg/mL
P
<
001)
declined
significantly
after
troglitazone
treatment
Leuprolide-stimulated
levels
of
17-hydroxyprogesterone
androstenedione
and
total
testosterone
were
significantly
lower
posttreatment
compared
to
pretreatment
The
reduction
in
androgen
levels
occurred
independently
of
any
changes
in
gonadotropin
levels
A
decreased
functional
activity
of
PAI-1
in
blood
(from
127
+/-
28
to
63
+/-
14
AU/mL
P
<
005)
was
associated
with
a
decreased
concentration
of
PAI-1
protein
(from
649
+/-
91
to
448
+/-
61
ng/mL
P
<
005)
No
change
in
the
functional
activity
of
tissue
plasminogen
activator
(from
53
+/-
04
to
51
+/-
05
IU/mL)
was
observed
despite
a
decrease
in
its
concentration
(from
96
+/-
09
to
82
+/-
07
ng/mL
P
<
005)
The
marked
reduction
in
PAI-1
could
be
expected
to
improve
the
fibrinolytic
response
to
thrombosis
in
these
subjects
We
conclude
that
administration
of
troglitazone
to
women
with
PCOS
and
impaired
glucose
tolerance
ameliorates
the
metabolic
and
hormonal
derangements
characteristic
of
the
syndrome
Troglitazone
holds
potential
as
a
useful
primary
or
adjunctive
treatment
for
women
with
PCOS
