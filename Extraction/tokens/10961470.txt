Usefulness
of
urodynamic
examination
in
female
urinary
incontinence--lessons
from
a
population-based
randomized
controlled
study
of
conservative
treatment
Abstract
Text
To
test
the
usefulness
of
urodynamic
examination
in
female
urinary
incontinence
As
part
of
a
population-based
randomized
controlled
treatment
study
in
general
practice
the
control
group
was
offered
urodynamic
examination
before
and
after
delayed
treatment
starting
6
months
after
inclusion
in
the
study
ie
after
the
first
outcome
evaluation
comparing
the
initially
treated
group
with
the
control
group
The
intervention
group
was
offered
urodynamic
examination
only
after
the
final
outcome
evaluation
at
12
months
Eighty-seven
women
aged
50-74
from
three
Norwegian
municipalities
participated
There
was
no
difference
in
treatment
outcome
whether
the
patients
had
urodynamic
examination
or
not
Eleven
patients
(26%
of
42
control
patients)
had
their
diagnosis
revised
after
urodynamic
examination
ten
of
them
with
a
subsequent
change
in
treatment
The
outcome
for
this
group
was
no
different
than
for
the
other
patients
As
a
subgroup
the
11
patients
had
more
severe
leakage
(p
=
0048)
and
more
previous
gynecological
operations
(p
=
0038)
than
the
other
control
group
patients
Our
study
supports
the
idea
that
in
general
practice
or
in
rather
unselected
patients
women
with
urinary
incontinence
may
be
classified
and
treated
without
urodynamic
examination
If
there
is
little
or
no
improvement
during
the
first
few
months
referral
should
be
considered
and
this
should
be
done
sooner
for
patients
with
severe
incontinence
or
prior
gynecological
operations
than
for
other
patients
