The
effect
of
opioids
on
phantom
limb
pain
and
cortical
reorganization
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
of
oral
retarded
morphine
sulphate
(MST)
was
tested
against
placebo
in
a
double-blind
crossover
design
in
12
patients
with
phantom
limb
pain
after
unilateral
leg
or
arm
amputation
Two
counterbalanced
treatment
phases
of
4
weeks
each
were
initiated
with
an
intravenous
test
infusion
of
MST
or
Placebo
The
titration
phase
was
2
weeks
The
dose
of
MST
was
titrated
to
at
least
70
mg/day
and
at
highest
300
mg/day
Pain
intensity
was
assessed
hourly
on
visual
analog
scales
during
a
4-week
treatment-free
phase
both
treatment
phases
and
at
two
follow-ups
(6
and
12
months)
Reorganization
of
somatosensory
cortex
electric
perception
and
pain
thresholds
as
well
as
selective
attention
were
measured
pre-
and
post-treatment
A
significant
pain
reduction
was
found
during
MST
but
not
during
placebo
A
clinically
relevant
response
to
MST
(pain
reduction
of
more
than
50%)
was
evident
in
42%
a
partial
response
(pain
reduction
of
25-50%)
in
8%
of
the
patients
Neuromagnetic
source
imaging
of
three
patients
showed
initial
evidence
for
reduced
cortical
reorganization
under
MST
concurrent
with
the
reduction
in
pain
intensity
Perception
and
pain
thresholds
were
not
significantly
altered
whereas
attention
was
significantly
lower
under
MST
Thus
opioids
show
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
phantom
limb
pain
and
may
potentially
influence
also
cortical
reorganization
These
data
need
to
be
replicated
in
larger
patient
samples
