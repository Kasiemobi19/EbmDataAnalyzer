When
should
a
trial
of
fluoxetine
for
major
depression
be
declared
failed
Abstract
Text
Although
the
newer
antidepressants
are
widely
used
little
is
known
about
how
long
it
takes
to
see
their
full
effect
The
authors
sought
to
determine
how
many
weeks
a
fluoxetine
trial
with
no
improvement
should
continue
before
treatment
is
changed
The
data
involved
840
patients
in
a
12-week
open
trial
of
fluoxetine
20
mg/day
followed
by
a
blinded
placebo-controlled
discontinuation
study
Outcomes
at
4
6
8
10
and
12
weeks
were
classified
as
nonresponse
partial
response
response
and
remission
and
were
based
on
Hamilton
Depression
Rating
Scale
scores
The
rate
of
remission
at
week
12
was
calculated
for
each
group
of
patients
without
remission
at
the
earlier
time
points
The
time
to
relapse
during
weeks
13-26
of
the
discontinuation
study
was
examined
in
patients
taking
placebo
and
fluoxetine
in
relation
to
status
at
week
6
Patients
unimproved
at
week
6
had
a
remission
rate
at
week
12
of
31%-41%
For
patients
with
remission
at
week
12
level
of
improvement
at
week
6
did
not
affect
prognosis
in
weeks
13-26
Of
the
unimproved
patients
at
week
8
23%
had
remissions
by
week
12
The
week
12
remission
rate
for
unimproved
patients
at
week
4
was
clearly
high
enough
to
justify
continued
treatment
the
rate
for
unimproved
patients
at
week
10
was
too
low
These
data
suggest
that
nonresponse
to
fluoxetine
should
not
be
declared
until
8
weeks
of
treatment
have
elapsed
Practitioners
should
discuss
trial
length
with
patients
at
the
beginning
of
treatment
