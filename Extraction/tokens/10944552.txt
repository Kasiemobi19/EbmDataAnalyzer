Lung
cancer
mortality
in
the
Mayo
Lung
Project
impact
of
extended
follow-up
Abstract
Text
The
Mayo
Lung
Project
(MLP)
was
a
randomized
controlled
clinical
trial
of
lung
cancer
screening
that
was
conducted
in
9211
male
smokers
between
1971
and
1983
The
intervention
arm
was
offered
chest
x-ray
and
sputum
cytology
every
4
months
for
6
years
the
usual-care
arm
was
advised
at
trial
entry
to
receive
the
same
tests
annually
No
lung
cancer
mortality
benefit
was
evident
at
the
end
of
the
study
We
have
extended
follow-up
through
1996
A
National
Death
Index-PLUS
search
was
used
to
assign
vital
status
and
date
and
cause
of
death
for
6523
participants
with
unknown
information
The
median
survival
for
lung
cancer
patients
diagnosed
before
July
1
1983
was
calculated
by
use
of
Kaplan-Meier
estimates
Survival
curves
were
compared
with
the
log-rank
test
The
median
follow-up
time
was
205
years
Lung
cancer
mortality
was
44
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
=
39-49)
deaths
per
1000
person-years
in
the
intervention
arm
and
39
(95%
CI
=
35-44)
in
the
usual-care
arm
(two-sided
P
for
difference
=09)
For
participants
diagnosed
with
lung
cancer
before
July
1
1983
survival
was
better
in
the
intervention
arm
(two-sided
P
=0039)
The
median
survival
for
patients
with
resected
early-stage
disease
was
160
years
in
the
intervention
arm
versus
50
years
in
the
usual-care
arm
Extended
follow-up
of
MLP
participants
did
not
reveal
a
lung
cancer
mortality
reduction
for
the
intervention
arm
Similar
mortality
but
better
survival
for
individuals
in
the
intervention
arm
indicates
that
some
lesions
with
limited
clinical
relevance
may
have
been
identified
in
the
intervention
arm
