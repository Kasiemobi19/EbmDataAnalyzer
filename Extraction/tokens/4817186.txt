Blood
pressure
in
women
taking
oral
contraceptives
Abstract
Text
A
controlled
prospective
survey
of
women
taking
oestrogen-progestogen
oral
contraceptives
showed
increases
in
mean
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
of
142
mm
Hg
and
85
mm
Hg
respectively
after
four
years
The
largest
increases
in
individual
cases
were
36
mm
Hg
systolic
and
20
mm
Hg
diastolic
Blood
pressure
returned
to
pretreatment
levels
within
three
months
after
oral
contraceptives
had
been
stopped
These
changes
in
blood
pressure
were
unrelated
to
the
progestogenic
potencies
of
the
preparations
being
taken
