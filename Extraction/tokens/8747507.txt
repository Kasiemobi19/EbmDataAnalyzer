Title
Evaluation
of
macrocytosis
by
general
practitioners
Abstract
Text
Macrocytosis
is
considered
to
be
an
important
sign
of
disease
although
it
often
seems
to
be
ignored
The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
assess
the
quality
of
the
work
done
by
general
practitioners
using
macrocytosis
as
an
indicator
All
consecutive
outpatients
at
Tampere
City
Health
Center
who
had
blood
counts
taken
during
8
months
in
1990
and
were
found
to
have
macrocytosis
(MCV
>
or
=
100
femtoliters)
that
had
not
earlier
been
examined
were
included
in
this
study
The
further
examinations
undertaken
were
analyzed
Of
the
9527
blood
counts
previously
unexamined
macrocytosis
was
found
in
3%
(n
=
287
154
men
and
133
women)
Further
examination
because
of
macrocytosis
was
undertaken
in
65
(42%)
men
and
in
48
(36%)
women
Alcohol
abuse
was
the
most
common
disease
present
in
52
(80%)
men
and
in
22
(46%)
women
No
cause
for
macrocytosis
was
found
in
seven
men
and
in
17
women
No
difference
between
the
examined
and
unexamined
groups
was
found
concerning
medical
history
medications
symptoms
or
blood
count
values
including
hemoglobin
and
MCV
Evaluation
of
macrocytosis
when
undertaken
was
well
done
by
general
practitioners
However
it
was
performed
too
seldom
and
thus
several
diseases
especially
alcohol
abuse
may
have
been
overlooked
