Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
effectiveness
of
metformin
in
improving
clinical
and
biochemical
features
of
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
Systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
Randomised
controlled
trials
that
investigated
the
effect
of
metformin
compared
with
either
placebo
or
no
treatment
or
compared
with
an
ovulation
induction
agent
13
trials
were
included
for
analysis
including
543
women
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
that
was
defined
by
using
biochemical
or
ultrasound
evidence
Pregnancy
and
ovulation
rates
Secondary
outcomes
of
clinical
and
biochemical
features
of
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
Meta-analysis
showed
that
metformin
is
effective
in
achieving
ovulation
in
women
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
with
odds
ratios
of
388
(95%
confidence
interval
225
to
669)
for
metformin
compared
with
placebo
and
441
(237
to
822)
for
metformin
and
clomifene
compared
with
clomifene
alone
An
analysis
of
pregnancy
rates
shows
a
significant
treatment
effect
for
metformin
and
clomifene
(odds
ratio
440
196
to
985)
Metformin
has
an
effect
in
reducing
fasting
insulin
concentrations
blood
pressure
and
low
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
We
found
no
evidence
of
any
effect
on
body
mass
index
or
waisthip
ratio
Metformin
was
associated
with
a
higher
incidence
of
nausea
vomiting
and
other
gastrointestinal
disturbance
Metformin
is
an
effective
treatment
for
anovulation
in
women
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
Its
choice
as
a
first
line
agent
seems
justified
and
there
is
some
evidence
of
benefit
on
variables
of
the
metabolic
syndrome
No
data
are
available
regarding
the
safety
of
metformin
in
long
term
use
in
young
women
and
only
limited
data
on
its
safety
in
early
pregnancy
It
should
be
used
as
an
adjuvant
to
general
lifestyle
improvements
and
not
as
a
replacement
for
increased
exercise
and
improved
diet
