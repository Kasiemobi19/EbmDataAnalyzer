Nocturnal
leg
cramps
in
older
people
Abstract
Text
Nocturnal
leg
cramps
are
common
in
older
people
Such
cramps
are
associated
with
many
common
diseases
and
medications
Physiological
methods
may
be
useful
for
preventing
cramps
in
some
people
but
there
have
been
no
controlled
trials
of
these
approaches
Quinine
is
moderately
effective
in
preventing
nocturnal
leg
cramps
However
there
are
concerns
about
the
risk/benefit
ratio
with
this
drug
In
patients
with
severe
symptoms
a
trial
of
4-6
weeks'
treatment
with
quinine
is
probably
still
justified
but
the
efficacy
of
treatment
should
be
monitored
for
example
using
a
sleep
and
cramp
diary
