there
any
connection

a

and

among

Abstract
Text
To
learn
whether
the
risk
of
revaccination
in
adults
should
limit
its
use
the
authors
investigated
whether
adverse
events
requiring
hospitalization
occurred
in
a
group
of
Medicare
enrollees
revaccinated
with
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
A
prospective
cohort
analysis
and
case
study
of
revaccinated
people
involved
five
percent
of
all
elderly
Medicare
enrollees
from
1985
through
1988
consisting
of
66256
people
receiving
one
dose
of
vaccine
and
1099
receiving
two
doses
Comparison
was
made
of
the
hospitalization
rate
within
30
days
after
revaccination
and
rates
of
singly
vaccinated
persons
using
discharge
diagnosis
for
all
those
hospitalized
during
the
30
days
after
revaccination
No
significant
difference
was
found
between
the
hospitalization
rate
of
the
revaccinated
cohort
and
comparison
group
No
adverse
reactions
attributable
to
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
causing
hospitalization
were
identified
among
39
revaccinated
persons
who
were
hospitalized
within
30
days
of
revaccination
Revaccination
of
elderly
Medicare
beneficiaries
does
not
cause
events
serious
enough
to
require
hospitalization
Vaccination
of
persons
according
to
the
Public
Health
Service
Immunization
Practice
Advisory
Committee
guidelines
is
recommended
when
the
prior
immunization
status
is
unknown
