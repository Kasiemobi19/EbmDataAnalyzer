The
incidence
of
thyroid
disorders
in
the
community
a
twenty-year
follow-up
of
the
Whickham
Survey
Abstract
Text
The
original
Whickham
Survey
documented
the
prevalence
of
thyroid
disorders
in
a
randomly
selected
sample
of
2779
adults
which
matched
the
population
of
Great
Britain
in
age
sex
and
social
class
The
aim
of
the
twenty-year
follow-up
survey
was
to
determine
the
incidence
and
natural
history
of
thyroid
disease
in
this
cohort
Subjects
were
traced
at
follow-up
via
the
Electoral
Register
General
Practice
registers
Gateshead
Family
Health
Services
Authority
register
and
Office
of
Population
Censuses
and
Surveys
Eight
hundred
and
twenty-five
subjects
(30%
of
the
sample)
had
died
and
in
addition
to
death
certificates
two-thirds
had
information
from
either
hospital/General
Practitioner
notes
or
post-mortem
reports
to
document
morbidity
prior
to
death
Of
the
1877
known
survivors
96%
participated
in
the
follow-up
study
and
91%
were
tested
for
clinical
biochemical
and
immunological
evidence
of
thyroid
dysfunction
Outcomes
in
terms
of
morbidity
and
mortality
were
determined
for
over
97%
of
the
original
sample
The
mean
incidence
(with
95%
confidence
intervals)
of
spontaneous
hypothyroidism
in
women
was
35/1000
survivors/year
(28-45)
rising
to
41/1000
survivors/year
(33-50)
for
all
causes
of
hypothyroidism
and
in
men
was
06/1000
survivors/year
(03-12)
The
mean
incidence
of
hyperthyroidism
in
women
was
08/1000
survivors/year
(05-14)
and
was
negligible
in
men
Similar
incidence
rates
were
calculated
for
the
deceased
subjects
An
estimate
of
the
probability
of
the
development
of
hypothyroidism
and
hyperthyroidism
at
a
particular
time
ie
the
hazard
rate
showed
an
increase
with
age
in
hypothyroidism
but
no
age
relation
in
hyperthyroidism
The
frequency
of
goitre
decreased
with
age
with
10%
of
women
and
2%
of
men
having
a
goitre
at
follow-up
as
compared
to
23%
and
5%
in
the
same
subjects
respectively
at
the
first
survey
The
presence
of
a
goitre
at
either
survey
was
not
associated
with
any
clinical
or
biochemical
evidence
of
thyroid
dysfunction
In
women
an
association
was
found
between
the
development
of
a
goitre
and
thyroid-antibody
status
at
follow-up
but
not
initially
The
risk
of
having
developed
hypothyroidism
at
follow-up
was
examined
with
respect
to
risk
factors
identified
at
first
survey
The
odds
ratios
(with
95%
confidence
intervals)
of
developing
hypothyroidism
with
(a)
raised
serum
TSH
alone
were
8
(3-20)
for
women
and
44
(19-104)
for
men
(b)
positive
anti-thyroid
antibodies
alone
were
8
(5-15)
for
women
and
25
(10-63)
for
men
(c)
both
raised
serum
TSH
and
positive
anti-thyroid
antibodies
were
38
(22-65)
for
women
and
173
(81-370)
for
men
A
logit
model
indicated
that
increasing
values
of
serum
TSH
above
2mU/l
at
first
survey
increased
the
probability
of
developing
hypothyroidism
which
was
further
increased
in
the
presence
of
anti-thyroid
antibodies
Neither
a
positive
family
history
of
any
form
of
thyroid
disease
nor
parity
of
women
at
first
survey
was
associated
with
increased
risk
of
developing
hypothyroidism
Fasting
cholesterol
and
triglyceride
levels
at
first
survey
when
corrected
for
age
showed
no
association
with
the
development
of
hypothyroidism
in
women
This
historical
cohort
study
has
provided
incidence
data
for
thyroid
disease
over
a
twenty-year
period
for
a
representative
cross-sectional
sample
of
the
population
and
has
allowed
the
determination
of
the
importance
of
prognostic
risk
factors
for
thyroid
disease
identified
twenty
years
earlier
