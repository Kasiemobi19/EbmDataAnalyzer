Abstract
Text
This
paper
is
a
systematic
review
of
metformin
versus
clomiphene
citrate
(CC)
in
women
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS)
Meta-analysis
Of
Observational
Studies
in
Epidemiology
(MOOSE)
and
QUality
Of
Reporting
Of
Meta-analyses
(QUOROM)
guidelines
were
followed
A
systematic
computerized
literature
search
was
done
of
seven
bibliographic
databases
Inclusion
criteria
included
cohort
and
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCT)
of
women
with
PCOS
and
the
following
medications
metformin
versus
placebo
metformin
versus
CC
metformin
plus
CC
versus
placebo
plus
CC
Rev-man
41
and
Metaview
40
were
used
to
analyse
data
Relative
risk
(RR)
estimates
were
presented
A
chi2-test
determined
the
significance
of
the
association
Heterogeneity
was
determined
by
the
Cochran
Q-test
Metformin
was
50%
better
than
placebo
for
ovulation
induction
in
infertile
PCOS
patients
[RR
150
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
113
199]
Metformin
was
also
of
benefit
in
non-infertile
(ie
patients
with
PCOS
who
were
not
complaining
of
infertility)
PCOS
patients
for
cycle
regulation
compared
to
placebo
(RR
145
CI
111
190)
Metformin
was
not
of
confirmed
benefit
versus
placebo
for
achievement
of
pregnancy
(RR
107
CI
020
574)
Metformin
plus
CC
may
be
3-4-fold
superior
to
CC
alone
for
ovulation
induction
(RR
304
CI
177
524)
and
pregnancy
(RR
365
CI
111
1199)
in
women
with
PCOS
Metformin
is
effective
for
ovulation
induction
and
cycle
regulation
in
this
group
of
patients
Metformin
plus
CC
appears
to
be
very
effective
for
achievement
of
pregnancy
compared
to
CC
alone
No
RCTs
directly
compare
metformin
to
CC
but
the
need
for
such
a
trial
exists
