Metered-dose
inhaler
accessory

in
acute
asthma
efficacy
and
comparison
with
nebulizers
a
literature
review
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
current
literature
about
the
efficacy
of
providing
inhaled
medications
by
metered-dose
inhalers
and
accessory
devices
(MDI/ADs)
to
children
with
acute
asthma
and
to
compare
it
with
the
current
standard
of
care
small-volume
nebulizers
(SVNs)
Online
computer
and
manual
searches
in
English-language
journal
articles
published
between
1980
and
1996
Seventeen
prospective
clinical
trials
that
have
used
MDI/ADs
in
the
treatment
of
acute
asthma
in
children
were
retrieved
Ten
randomized
controlled
studies
that
included
a
comparison
with
SVN
treatment
were
selected
Studies
were
assessed
qualitatively
by
their
subject
characteristics
design
intervention
procedures
outcome
measures
and
results
There
were
marked
variations
in
types
of
MDI/ADs
and
in
doses
administered
between
and
within
studies
Major
outcome
measures
included
pulmonary
function
measurements
and
clinical
scores
All
studies
found
MDI/ADs
to
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
infants
and
children
with
acute
asthma
Among
those
who
compared
this
treatment
with
SVN
2
found
the
MDI/AD
superior
and
the
rest
found
it
as
effective
as
the
SVN
The
data
support
the
effectiveness
of
MDI/ADs
as
first-line
treatment
in
acute
childhood
asthma
In
view
of
clinical
benefit
safety
lower
cost
personnel
time
and
speed
and
ease
of
administration
of
MDI/ADs
compared
with
SVNs
MDI/ADs
should
be
considered
the
preferred
mode
of
treatment
of
children
with
acute
asthma
