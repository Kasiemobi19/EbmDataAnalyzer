Title
Systematic
review
of
the
relationship
between
early
introduction
of
solid
foods
to
infants
and
the
development
of
allergic
disease
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
evidence
that
early
solid
feeding
(before
age
4
months)
increases
the
risk
of
allergic
disease
MEDLINE
the
Cochrane
Library
and
the
Drugs
and
Pharmacology
section
of
EMBASE
with
key
words
"infant"
"food"
and
"allergy"
We
found
2719
article
citations
and
reviewed
references
of
relevant
articles
We
critically
evaluated
the
methods
and
results
of
articles
that
met
inclusion
criteria
We
identified
13
studies
that
met
inclusion
criteria
There
was
only
1
controlled
trial
Allergic
disease
Five
studies
found
a
positive
association
between
early
solid
feeding
and
eczema
with
a
persistence
of
the
association
for
10
years
in
1
study
Four
studies
found
no
association
One
study
found
an
association
between
early
solid
feeding
and
pollen
allergy
We
found
no
strong
evidence
to
support
the
association
between
early
solid
feeding
and
the
development
of
persistent
asthma
persistent
food
allergy
allergic
rhinitis
or
animal
dander
allergy
Systematic
review
of
available
evidence
suggests
that
early
solid
feeding
may
increase
the
risk
of
eczema
However
there
are
little
data
supporting
an
association
between
early
solid
feeding
and
other
allergic
conditions
Since
many
studies
had
problematic
methods
additional
controlled
trials
are
needed
to
help
guide
physicians
as
they
advise
parents
about
the
allergic
risks
of
early
introduction
of
solids
