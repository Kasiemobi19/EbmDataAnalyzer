Maternal
and
perinatal
outcomes
associated
with
a
trial
of
labor
after
prior
cesarean
delivery
Abstract
Text
The
proportion
of
women
who
attempt
vaginal
delivery
after
prior
cesarean
delivery
has
decreased
largely
because
of
concern
about
safety
The
absolute
and
relative
risks
associated
with
a
trial
of
labor
in
women
with
a
history
of
cesarean
delivery
as
compared
with
elective
repeated
cesarean
delivery
without
labor
are
uncertain
We
conducted
a
prospective
four-year
observational
study
of
all
women
with
a
singleton
gestation
and
a
prior
cesarean
delivery
at
19
academic
medical
centers
Maternal
and
perinatal
outcomes
were
compared
between
women
who
underwent
a
trial
of
labor
and
women
who
had
an
elective
repeated
cesarean
delivery
without
labor
Vaginal
delivery
was
attempted
by
17898
women
and
15801
women
underwent
elective
repeated
cesarean
delivery
without
labor
Symptomatic
uterine
rupture
occurred
in
124
women
who
underwent
a
trial
of
labor
(07
percent)
Hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy
occurred
in
no
infants
whose
mothers
underwent
elective
repeated
cesarean
delivery
and
in
12
infants
born
at
term
whose
mothers
underwent
a
trial
of
labor
(P<0001)
Seven
of
these
cases
of
hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy
followed
uterine
rupture
(absolute
risk
046
per
1000
women
at
term
undergoing
a
trial
of
labor)
including
two
neonatal
deaths
The
rate
of
endometritis
was
higher
in
women
undergoing
a
trial
of
labor
than
in
women
undergoing
repeated
elective
cesarean
delivery
(29
percent
vs
18
percent)
as
was
the
rate
of
blood
transfusion
(17
percent
vs
10
percent)
The
frequency
of
hysterectomy
and
of
maternal
death
did
not
differ
significantly
between
groups
(02
percent
vs
03
percent
and
002
percent
vs
004
percent
respectively)
A
trial
of
labor
after
prior
cesarean
delivery
is
associated
with
a
greater
perinatal
risk
than
is
elective
repeated
cesarean
delivery
without
labor
although
absolute
risks
are
low
This
information
is
relevant
for
counseling
women
about
their
choices
after
a
cesarean
section
