Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
risk
factors
for
early
cytologic
abnormalities
and
recurrent
cervical
dysplasia
after
loop
electrosurgical
excision
procedure
(LEEP)
A
retrospective
analysis
was
performed
of
all
pathology
records
for
LEEPs
performed
at
our
institution
from
January
1996
through
July
1998
Follow-up
cytology
from
2
through
12
months
after
LEEP
was
reviewed
Patients
with
abnormal
cytology
were
referred
for
further
colposcopic
evaluation
Statistical
analysis
using
chi2
test
for
trend
proportional
hazards
model
test
Fisher
exact
tests
and
life
table
analysis
were
performed
to
identify
risk
factors
for
early
cytologic
abnormalities
after
LEEP
and
to
determine
relative
risk
of
recurrent
dysplasia
A
total
of
298
women
underwent
LEEP
during
the
study
period
and
29%
of
these
had
cytologic
abnormalities
after
LEEP
Grade
of
dysplasia
ectocervical
marginal
status
endocervical
marginal
status
and
glandular
involvement
with
dysplasia
were
not
found
to
be
independent
risk
factors
for
early
cytologic
abnormalities
However
when
risk
factors
were
analyzed
cumulatively
the
abnormal
cytology
rate
increased
from
24%
with
no
risk
factors
to
67%
with
three
risk
factors
present
(P
=037)
Of
patients
with
abnormal
cytology
after
LEEP
40%
developed
subsequent
dysplasia
and
the
mean
time
to
diagnosis
was
approximately
6
months
The
relative
risk
of
subsequent
dysplasia
ranged
from
a
20%
increase
to
twice
the
risk
if
post-LEEP
cytology
was
low-grade
squamous
intraepithelial
lesion
or
high-grade
squamous
intraepithelial
lesion
respectively
Based
on
these
results
consideration
should
be
given
for
early
colposcopic
examination
of
patients
who
have
evidence
of
marginal
involvement
or
endocervical
glandular
involvement
with
dysplasia
These
patients
are
at
increased
risk
for
abnormal
cytology
and
recurrent
dysplasia
This
initial
visit
should
occur
at
6
months
as
the
mean
time
to
recurrence
of
dysplasia
was
65
months
