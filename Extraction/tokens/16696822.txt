Prophylactic

focus

emerging

stabilizers
Abstract
Text
Bipolar
disorders
are
reported
to
have
a
high
incidence
during
childbearing
years
and
the
need
may
arise
to
start
or
continue
a
pharmacological
treatment
during
pregnancy
and
the
postpartum
period
In
the
last
few
years
several
investigations
have
evaluated
the
efficacy
of
emerging
mood-stabilizing
agents
in
the
treatment
of
bipolar
disorders
such
as
lamotrigine
olanzapine
risperidone
quetiapine
aripiprazole
and
ziprasidone
A
number
of
studies
which
examined
the
use
of
oxcarbazepine
point
to
its
potential
usefulness
in
prophylactic
treatment
The
aim
of
this
review
is
to
compare
information
from
the
literature
on
the
safety
of
lamotrigine
oxcarbazepine
risperidone
olanzapine
and
quetiapine
to
the
safety
data
on
classic
mood
stabilizers
during
pregnancy
and
the
postpartum
period
A
computerized
search
carried
out
from
1980
to
April
5
2006
led
to
the
summarization
of
the
results
(References
were
updated
after
acceptance
and
prior
to
publication)
Emerging
mood
stabilizers
show
uncertain
safety
parameters
in
pregnancy
and
lactation
Limited
information
on
lamotrigine
and
oxcarbazepine
does
not
suggest
a
clear
increase
in
teratogenicity
while
olanzapine
appears
to
be
associated
with
a
higher
risk
of
metabolic
complications
in
pregnant
women
Data
about
risperidone
and
quetiapine
are
still
inconclusive
Finally
the
literature
on
the
safety
of
these
compounds
in
breastfeeding
is
anecdotal
Untreated
pregnant
bipolar
women
are
at
an
increased
risk
of
poor
obstetrical
outcomes
and
relapse
of
affective
symptoms
On
the
other
hand
classic
antiepileptic
drugs
are
well-known
human
teratogens
whereas
data
on
lithium
are
partially
ambiguous
The
safety
of
emerging
mood
stabilizers
in
pregnancy
and
breastfeeding
has
not
been
examined
extensively
Therefore
when
approaching
bipolar
disorder
if
possible
each
episode
must
be
considered
separately
