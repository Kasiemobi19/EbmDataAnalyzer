Evolution

superficial
vein
thrombosis
treated
with
defibrotide
comparison
with
low
dose
subcutaneous
heparin
Abstract
Text
Forty
patients
with
superficial
vein
thrombosis
(SVT)
or
thrombophlebitis
were
randomly
treated
either
with
defibrotide
(20)
an
antithrombotic/profibrinolytic
drug
or
with
low-dose
subcutaneous
heparin
[LDSH]
(20)
for
3
weeks
The
efficacy
of
the
two
treatments
was
evaluated
by
means
of
computerized
thermography
monitoring
the
decrease
of
the
areas
at
maximum
temperature
(AMT)
and
using
an
analogue
scale
line
to
evaluate
signs
and
symptoms
Defibrotide
was
found
to
be
significantly
more
effective
than
LDSH
in
decreasing
both
AMT
and
analogue
score
after
2
and
3
weeks
By
enhancing
endogenous
fibrinolysis
defibrotide
reduced
the
deposition
of
fibrin
the
ensuing
inflammatory
response
and
the
production
of
new
thrombi
in
the
affected
veins
This
was
shown
by
the
progressive
decrease
in
the
hyperthermic
areas
Thanks
to
its
activity
defibrotide
may
be
able
to
promote
a
faster
removal
of
thrombi
and
reduce
the
continuous
formation
of
new
thrombi
in
the
inflamed
veins
