Pramipexole
vs

as
initial
treatment
for
Parkinson

A

Abstract
Text
Pramipexole
and
levodopa
both
ameliorate
the
motor
symptoms
of
early
Parkinson
disease
(PD)
but
no
controlled
studies
have
compared
long-term
outcomes
after
initiating
dopaminergic
therapy
with
pramipexole
vs
levodopa
To
compare
the
development
of
dopaminergic
motor
complications
after
initial
treatment
of
early
PD
with
pramipexole

Multicenter

Academic

Three
hundred

patients
with
early
PD
who
required
dopaminergic
therapy
to
treat
emerging
disability
enrolled
between
October
1996
and
August
1997
Subjects
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
pramipexole
05
mg
3
times
per
day
with
levodopa
placebo
(n
=
151)
or
carbidopa/levodopa
25/100
mg
3
times
per
day
with
pramipexole
placebo
(n
=
150)
For
patients
with
residual
disability
the
dosage
was
escalated
during
the
first
10
weeks
From
week
11
to
month
235
investigators
were
permitted
to
add
open-label
levodopa
to
treat
continuing
or
emerging
disability

Initial

resulted
in
significantly

(28%)

The
mean
improvement
in
total
UPDRS
score
from
baseline
to
235
months
was
greater
in
the
levodopa
group
than
in
the
pramipexole
group
(92

45

Somnolence
was
more
common
in
pramipexole-treated
patients
than
in
levodopa-treated
patients
(324%
vs
173%
P
=003)
and
the
difference
was
seen
during
the
escalation
phase
of
treatment
In
the
subgroup
study
patients
treated
initially
with
pramipexole
(n
=
39)
showed
a
mean
(SD)
decline
of
200%
(142%)
in
striatal
beta-CIT
uptake
compared
with
a
248%
(144%)
decline
in
subjects
treated
initially
with
levodopa
(n
=
39
P
=15)
Fewer
patients
receiving
initial
treatment
for
PD
with
pramipexole
developed
dopaminergic
motor
complications
than
with
levodopa
therapy
Despite
supplementation
with
open-label
levodopa
in
both
groups
the
levodopa-treated
group
had
a
greater
improvement
in
total
UPDRS
compared
with
the
pramipexole
group
