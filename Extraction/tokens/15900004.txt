Risk
of
celiac
disease
autoimmunity
and
timing
of
gluten
introduction
in
the
diet
of
infants
at
increased
risk
of
disease
Abstract
Text
While
gluten
ingestion
is
responsible
for
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
celiac
disease
it
is
not
known
what
factors
are
associated
with
initial
appearance
of
the
disease
To
examine
whether
the
timing
of
gluten
exposure
in
the
infant
diet
was
associated
with
the
development
of
celiac
disease
autoimmunity
(CDA)
Prospective
observational
study
conducted
in
Denver
Colo
from
1994-2004
of
1560
children
at
increased
risk
for
celiac
disease
or
type
1
diabetes
as
defined
by
possession
of
either
HLA-DR3
or
DR4
alleles
or
having
a
first-degree
relative
with
type
1
diabetes
The
mean
follow-up
was
48
years
Risk
of
CDA
defined
as
being
positive
for
tissue
transglutaminase
(tTG)
autoantibody
on
2
or
more
consecutive
visits
or
being
positive
for
tTG
once
and
having
a
positive
small
bowel
biopsy
for
celiac
disease
by
timing
of
introduction
of
gluten-containing
foods
into
the
diet
Fifty-one
children
developed
CDA
Findings
adjusted
for
HLA-DR3
status
indicated
that
children
exposed
to
foods
containing
wheat
barley
or
rye
(gluten-containing
foods)
in
the
first
3
months
of
life
(3
[6%]
CDA
positive
vs
40
[3%]
CDA
negative)
had
a
5-fold
increased
risk
of
CDA
compared
with
children
exposed
to
gluten-containing
foods
at
4
to
6
months
(12
[23%]
CDA
positive
vs
574
[38%]
CDA
negative)
(hazard
ratio
[HR]
517
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
144-1857)
Children
not
exposed
to
gluten
until
the
seventh
month
or
later
(36
[71%]
CDA
positive
vs
895
[59%]
CDA
negative)
had
a
marginally
increased
risk
of
CDA
compared
with
those
exposed
at
4
to
6
months
(HR
187
95%
CI
097-360)
After
restricting
our
case
group
to
only
the
25
CDA-positive
children
who
had
biopsy-diagnosed
celiac
disease
initial
exposure
to
wheat
barley
or
rye
in
the
first
3
months
(3
[12%]
CDA
positive
vs
40
[3%]
CDA
negative)
or
in
the
seventh
month
or
later
(19
[76%]
CDA
positive
vs
912
[59%]
CDA
negative)
significantly
increased
risk
of
CDA
compared
with
exposure
at
4
to
6
months
(3
[12%]
CDA
positive
vs
583
[38%]
CDA
negative)
(HR

Timing
of
introduction
of
gluten
into
the
infant
diet
is
associated
with
the
appearance
of
CDA
in
children
at
increased
risk
for
the
disease
