Title
The
Jones'
fracture
in
the
nonathlete
Abstract
Text
A
review
of
the
literature
concerning
Jones'
fractures
yields
a
relatively
recent
description
of
the
entity
as
a
chronic
condition
frequently
arising
as
a
stress
fracture
in
young
athletes
and
not
infrequently
requiring
surgical
correction
Over
a
5-year
period
we
have
treated
53
patients
with
Jones'
fracture
All
patients
were
nonathletes
Each
described
as
Jones
did
originally
an
acute
injury
Thirty-six
patients
were
followed
to
union
There
were
two
delayed
unions
and
no
nonunions
