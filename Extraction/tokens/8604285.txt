Abstract
Text
This
practice
parameter
formulates
recommendations
for
health
care
providers
about
the
management
of
acute
diarrhea
in
children
ages
1
month
to
5
years
It
was
developed
through
a
comprehensive
search
and
analysis
of
the
medical
literature
Expert
consensus
opinion
was
used
to
enhance
or
formulate
recommentations
where
data
were
insufficient
The
Provisional
Committee
on
Quality
Improvement
of
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
(AAP)
selected
a
subcommittee
composed
of
pediatricians
with
expertise
in
the
fields
of
gastroenterology
infectious
diseases
pediatric
practice
and
epidemiology
to
develop
the
parameter
The
subcommittee
the
Provisional
Committee
on
Quality
Improvement
a
review
panel
of
practitioners
and
other
groups
of
experts
within
and
outside
the
AAP
reviewed
and
revised
the
parameter
Three
specific
management
issues
were
considered
(1)
methods
of
rehydration
(2)
refeeding
after
rehydration
and
(3)
the
use
of
antidiarrheal
agents
Main
outcomes
considered
were
success
or
failure
of
rehydration
resolution
of
diarrhea
and
adverse
effects
from
various
treatment
options
A
comprehensive
bibliography
of
literature
on
gastroenteritis
and
diarrhea
was
compiled
and
reduced
to
articles
amenable
to
analysis
Oral
rehydration
therapy
was
studied
in
depth
inconsistency
in
the
outcomes
measured
in
the
studies
interfered
with
meta-analysis
but
allowed
for
formulation
of
strong
conclusions
Oral
rehydration
was
found
to
be
as
effective
as
intravenous
therapy
in
rehydrating
children
with
mild
to
moderate
dehydration
and
is
the
therapy
of
first
choice
in
these
patients
Refeeding
was
supported
by
enough
comparable
studies
to
permit
a
valid
meta-analysis
Early
refeeding
with
milk
or
food
after
rehydration
does
not
prolong
diarrhea
there
is
evidence
that
it
may
reduce
the
duration
of
diarrhea
by
approximately
half
a
day
and
is
recommended
to
restore
nutritional
balance
as
soon
as
possible
Data
on
antidiarrheal
agents
were
not
sufficient
to
demonstrate
efficacy
therefore
the
routine
use
of
antidiarrheal
agents
is
not
recommended
because
many
of
these
agents
have
potentially
serious
adverse
effects
in
infants
and
young
children
This
pracrtice
parameter
is
not
indended
as
a
sole
source
of
guidance
in
the
treatment
of
acute
gastroenteritis
in
children
It
is
designed
to
assist
pediatricians
by
providing
an
analytic
framework
for
the
evaluation
and
treatment
of
this
condition
It
is
not
intended
to
replace
clinical
judgment
or
to
establish
a
protocol
for
all
patients
with
this
condition
It
rarely
will
provide
the
only
appropriate
approach
to
the
problem
A
technical
report
describing
the
analyses
used
to
prepare
this
parameter
and
a
patient
education
brochure
are
