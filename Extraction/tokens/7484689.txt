Leg
cramps
differential
diagnosis
and
management
Abstract
Text
Leg
cramps
are
a
common
problem
especially
in
the
elderly
The
differential
diagnosis
is
extensive
and
includes
the
following
conditions
true
cramps
such
as
those
related
to
heat
hemodialysis
and
electrolyte
disturbances
as
well
as
idiopathic
cramps
(the
most
common
type)
contractures
occurring
in
conditions
such
as
metabolic
myopathies
and
thyroid
disease
tetany
which
is
usually
related
to
electrolyte
disturbances
and
dystonias
such
as
occupational
cramps
and
those
related
to
antipsychotic
medications
Other
leg
problems
that
are
not
cramps
such
as
restless
legs
syndrome
and
periodic
leg
movements
also
must
be
distinguished
The
etiology
of
idiopathic
leg
cramps
is
not
clear
Treatments
for
leg
cramps
include
stretching
exercises
quinine
sulfate
and
vitamin
E
but
no
treatment
is
conclusively
effective
Nonetheless
in
many
patients
relief
of
symptoms
is
achieved
with
one
or
more
of
these
treatments
