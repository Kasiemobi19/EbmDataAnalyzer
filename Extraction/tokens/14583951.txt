Title
Mast-cell
stabilising
agents
to
prevent
exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
Abstract
Text
Exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
(or
asthma)
following
strenuous
physical
exertion
is
common
and
can
cause
sub-optimal
performance
symptoms
such
as
cough
dyspnea
wheeze
chest
tightness
and
can
lead
people
to
avoid
physical
activity
Management
focuses
on
prevention
with
pre-exercise
treatment
using
various
pharmacologic
agents
Mast
cell
stabilizing
agents
are
effective
in
attenuating
exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
but
their
effectiveness
compared
to
bronchodilator
agents
is
unclear
To
quantitatively
compare
the
effects
of
inhaling
a
single
dose
of
either
mast
cell
stabiliser
-
nedocromil
sodium
or
sodium
cromoglycate
-
to
a
single
dose
of
short
acting
beta-agonists
or
anti-cholinergic
agents
-
atropine
or
ipratropium
bromide
-
prior
to
a
strenuous
exercise
challenge
in
participants
with
asthma
who
are
at
least
6
years
of
age
and
suffer
from
reproducible
exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
The
review
also
compares
the
effects
between
a
short
acting
beta-agonist
alone
to
a
combination
of
a
short
acting
beta-agonist
+
mast
cell
stabiliser

Randomised
trials
comparing
a
single
prophylactic
dose
of
a
mast

stabiliser
to
a
short

anti-cholinergic

or
a
short

to

in

The

had

were
performed
Twenty-four
trials
(518
participants)
conducted
in
13
countries
between
1976
and
1998
were
included
All
drugs
were
effective
at
attenuating
the
exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
response
but
to
varying
degrees
even
within
the
same
individual
Compared
to
anti-cholinergic
agents
mast
cell
stabilisers
were
somewhat
more
effective
at
attenuating
bronchoconstriction
On
average
the
maximum
fall
on
MCS
was
reduced
to
71%
compared
to
138%
on
AC
(
WMD

individuals
with

(73%

and
clinical
protection
(73%
vs
52%
OR
=
27
95%
CI
11
to
64)
There
were
no
subgroup
differences
based
on
age
severity
or
study
quality
and
no
adverse
effects
were
reported
for
either
agent
group
When
compared
to
short
acting
beta-agonists
mast
cell
stabilisers
were
not
as
effective
at
preventing
deterioration
On
average
the
maximum
fall
on
MCS
was
112%
compared
to
43%
on
beta
agonists
(
WMD
=
68%
95%
CI
45
to
92)
MCS
provided
fewer
individuals
with
complete
protection
(66%
vs
85%
OR
=
03
95%
CI
02
to
05)
or
clinical
protection
(55%
vs

CI
02
to

There
were
no
significant
subgroup
differences
based
on
age
severity
drug
delivery
or
study
quality
A
non-significant
difference
in
side
effects
was
demonstrated
with
11%
of
short
acting
beta-agonist
patients
experiencing
side
effects
compared
to
3%
of
those
receiving
mast
cell
stabilisers
(OR
=
02
95%
CI
00
to
82)
Combining
masta-agonist
patients
experiencing
side
effects
compared
to
3%
of
those
receiving
mast
cell
stabilisers
(OR
=
02
95%
CI
00
to
82)
Combining
mast
cell
stabilisers
with
a
short
acting
beta-agonist
did
not
produce
significant
advantages
to
pulmonary
function
over
short
acting
beta-agonists
alone
On
average
the
maximum
fall
on
SABA
only
was
reduced
to
53%
compared
to
35%
on
the
combination
(
WMD
=
18%
95%
CI
-11
to
46)
Beta-agonists
alone
provided
fewer
individuals
with
complete
protection
(68%
vs
80%
OR
=
05
95%
CI
02
to
14)
or
clinical
protection
(70%
vs
86%
OR=04
95%
CI
01
to
12)
but
the
difference
did
not
reach
significance
(p=017)
There
were
no
subgroup
differences
In
a
population
of
stable
asthmatics
short
acting
beta-agonists
mast
cell
stabilisers
or
anticholinergics
will
provide
a
significant
protective
effect
against
exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction
with
few
adverse
effects
On
average
SABAs
resulted
in
more
effective
attenuation
than
mast
cell
stabilisers
while
mast
cell
stabilisers
were
more
effective
than
anti-cholinergic
agents
Combining
SABA
and
mast
cell
stabilisers
may
be
appropriate
in
selected
cases
The
variability
in
the
individual
degree
of
response
to
these
drugs
in
multi
arm
trials
suggests
clinicians
and
patients
work
together
to
identify
the
most
effective
prophylactic
therapy
