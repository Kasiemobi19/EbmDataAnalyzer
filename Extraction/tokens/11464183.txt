Title
Clinical
efficacy
of
topical
docosanol
10%
cream
for
herpes
simplex
labialis
A
multicenter
randomized
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Recurrent
herpes
simplex
labialis
(HSL)
occurs
in
20%
to
40%
of
the
US
population
Although
the
disease
is
self-limiting
in
persons
with
a
healthy
immune
response
patients
seek
treatment
because
of
the
discomfort
and
visibility
of
a
recurrent
lesion
Our
purpose
was
to
determine
whether
docosanol
10%
cream
(docosanol)
is
efficacious
compared
with
placebo
for
the
topical
treatment
of
episodes
of
acute
HSL
Two
identical
double-blind
placebo-controlled
studies
were
conducted
at
a
total
of
21
sites
Otherwise
healthy
adults
with
documented
histories
of
HSL
were
randomized
to
receive
either
docosanol
or
polyethylene
glycol
placebo
and
initiated
therapy
in
the
prodrome
or
erythema
stage
of
an
episode
Treatment
was
administered
5
times
daily
until
healing
occurred
(ie
the
crust
fell
off
spontaneously
or
there
was
no
longer
evidence
of
an
active
lesion)
with
twice-daily
visits
The
median
time
to
healing
in
the
370
docosanol-treated
patients
was
41
days
18
hours
shorter
than
observed
in
the
367
placebo-treated
patients
(P
=008
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]

The
docosanol
group
also
exhibited
reduced
times
from
treatment
initiation
to
(1)
cessation
of
pain
and
all
other
symptoms
(itching
burning
and/or
tingling
P
=002
95%
CI

165)
(2)
complete
healing
of
classic
lesions
(P
=023
95%
CI
1
245)
and
(3)
cessation
of
the
ulcer
or
soft
crust
stage
of
classic
lesions
(P
<001
95%
CI
8
25)
Aborted
episodes
were
experienced
by
40%
of
the
docosanol
recipients
versus
34%
of
placebo
recipients
(P
=109
95%
CI
for
odds
ratio
095
173)
Adverse
experiences
with
docosanol
were
mild
and
similar
to
those
with
placebo
Docosanol
applied
5
times
daily
is
safe
and
effective
in
the
treatment
of
recurrent
HSL
Differences
in
healing
time
compared
favorably
with
those
reported
for
the
only
treatment
of
HSL
that
has
been
approved
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
