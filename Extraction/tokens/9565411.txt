Increasing
breastfeeding
rates
to
reduce
infant
illness
at
the
community
level
Abstract
Text
Although
breastfeeding
is
associated
with
lower
rates
of
a
variety
of
infant
illnesses
skeptics
have
suggested
that
much
of
the
association
is
attributable
to
confounding
even
after
appropriate
statistical
adjustment
This
article
utilizes
a
novel
design
to
investigate
changes
in
infant
illness
at
the
community
level
after
a
successful
breastfeeding
promotion
program
In
this
population-based
cohort
study
the
medical
records
of
all
infants
born
in
one
Navajo
community
the
year
before
a
breastfeeding
promotion
program
(n
=
977)
and
the
year
during
the
intervention
(n
=
858)
were
reviewed
Outcomes
assessed
include
changes
after
the
intervention
in
proportion
breastfeeding
and/or
breastfeeding
exclusively
incidence
of
common
infant
illnesses
in
the
first
year
of
life
and
feeding-group
specific
incidence
of
illness
The
proportion
of
women
breastfeeding
exclusively
for
any
period
of
time
increased
from
164%
to
546%
after
the
intervention
The
percent
of
children
having
pneumonia
and
gastroenteritis
declined
32
2%
and
146%
respectively
after
the
intervention
Feeding-group
specific
rates
of
these
illnesses
were
unchanged
indicating
that
the
decline
observed
was
attributable
to
the
increased
proportion
of
infants
breastfeeding
In
contrast
rates
of
croup
and
bronchiolitis
increased
after
the
intervention
among
those
fed
formula
from
birth
suggesting
a
viral
epidemic
which
was
limited
to
those
never
exclusively
breastfed
Finally
sepsis
declined
in
both
formula-fed
and
breastfed
infants
after
the
intervention
suggesting
that
other
factors
affected
this
illness
outcome
after
the
intervention
Increasing
the
proportion
of
exclusively
breastfed
infants
seems
to
be
an
effective
means
of
reducing
infant
illness
at
the
community
level
The
experimental
design
suggests
that
the
increased
incidence
of
illness
among
minimally
breastfed
infants
is
causally
related
to
lack
of
breast
milk
rather
than
being
attributable
to
confounding
