Left
ventricular
hypertrophy
as
an
independent
predictor
of
acute
cerebrovascular
events
in
essential
hypertension
Abstract
Text
It
is
uncertain
whether
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
(LVH)
confers
an
increased
risk
for
cerebrovascular
disease
in
apparently
healthy
patients
with
essential
hypertension
A
total
of
2363
initially
untreated
hypertensive
patients
(mean
age
51+/-12
years
47%
women)
free
of
previous
cardiovascular
disease
were
followed
up
for
up
to
14
years
(mean
5
years)
At
entry
all
patients
underwent
diagnostic
tests
including
ECG
echocardiography
and
24-hour
ambulatory
blood
pressure
(BP)
monitoring
At
entry
the
prevalence
of
LVH
was
176%
by
ECG
(Perugia
score)
and
237%
by
echocardiography
(LVM
>125
g/m(2))
Over
the
subsequent
years
105
patients
experienced
a
first
stroke
or
transient
ischemic
attack
The
cerebrovascular
event
rate
was
higher
among
patients
with
LVH
at
entry
diagnosed
by
either
ECG
or
echocardiography
than
among
those
without
hypertrophy
(both
P<001)
After
control
for
the
significant
influence
of
age
sex
diabetes
and
24-hour
mean
ambulatory
BP
LVH
by
ECG
conferred
an
increased
risk
for
cerebrovascular
events
(relative
risk
[RR]
179
95%
CI
117
to
276)
LVH
by
echocardiography
also
conferred
a
higher
risk
for
cerebrovascular
events
(RR
164
95%
CI
107
to
268)
For
each
increase
in
LV
mass
of
1
SD
(29
g/m(2))
there
was
a
significant
independent
increase
in
the
risk
for
cerebrovascular
events
(RR
131
95%
CI
109
to
158)
In
apparently
healthy
patients
with
essential
hypertension
LVH
diagnosed
by
ECG
or
echocardiography
confers
an
excess
risk
for
stroke
and
transient
ischemic
attack
independently
of
BP
and
other
individual
risk
factors
