Abstract
Text
The
natural
history
of
allergic
disease
and
its
potential
for
prevention
merit
close
examination
because
of
the
explosive
worldwide
increase
in
the
prevalence
and
morbidity
of
atopic
disorders
This
study
examines
the
development
of
atopy
at
age
7
years
in
165
children
in
a
high-risk
cohort
previously
reported
from
birth
to
age
4
years
In
this
prospective
randomized
controlled
study
of
food
allergen
avoidance
in
infancy
the
prophylactic-treated
group
consisted
of
infants
whose
mothers
avoided
cow's
milk
egg
and
peanut
during
the
last
trimester
of
pregnancy
and
lactation
and
who
themselves
avoided
cow's
milk
until
age
1
year
(casein
hydrolysate
supplementation
before
age
1)
egg
until
age
2
years
and
peanut
and
fish
until
age
3
years
The
control
group
consisted
of
maternal/infant
pairs
who
followed
standard
feeding
practices
Despite
a
significant
reduction
in
food
allergy
and
milk
sensitization
before
age
2
years
none
of
the
following
differed
between
the
groups
at
age
7
years
food
allergy
atopic
dermatitis
allergic
rhinitis
asthma
any
atopic
disease
lung
function
food
or
aeroallergen
sensitization
serum
IgE
level
or
presence
of
nasal
eosinophils
or
nasal
basophilic
cells
Children
with
food
allergy
by
4
years
evidenced
higher
7-year
(current)
prevalences
of
allergic
rhinitis
and
asthma
(p
<
001)
Atopic
diseases/parameters
at
age
7
years
were
shown
by
multivariate
analysis
(p
<
005)
to
be
associated
with
several
genetic
and
environmental
risk
factors
(male
gender
maternal
nonwhite
ethnicity
and
asthma
and
household
smoking)
as
well
as
predictive
atopic
markers
during
infancy
(elevated
serum
IgE
level
egg
cow's
milk
and
peanut
sensitization
and
nasal
eosinophils
and
nasal
basophilic
cells)
These
findings
help
to
(1)
elucidate
the
natural
history
of
atopic
disease
in
high-risk
children
(2)
document
the
progression
of
allergy
from
atopic
dermatitis
food
allergy
and
food
sensitization
to
respiratory
allergy
and
aeroallergen
sensitization
despite
food
allergy
prevention
in
infancy
(3)
identify
allergy
predictive
markers
and
(4)
expand
our
appreciation
of
the
interactions
of
genetic
and
environmental
factors
in
the
development
of
atopy
