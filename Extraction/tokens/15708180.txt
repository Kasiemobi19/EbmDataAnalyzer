Abstract
Text
In
addition
to
lowering
lipid
profile
statins
have
pleiotropic
effects
on
improving
vascular
function
Changes
of
these
pleiotropic
effects
and
their
relationship
to
lipid
profile
after
withdrawal
of
statin
treatment
remained
unclear
We
investigated
the
changes
of
lipid
profile
and
plasma
concentrations
of
human
soluble
vascular
cell
adhesion
molecule-1
(sVCAM-1)
and
human
tissue
type
plasminogen
activator
(tPA)
after
withdrawal
of
statin
treatment
Twenty-two
patients
(14
F
8
M
aged
63+/-13
years)
with
hypercholesterolemia
were
treated
with
atorvastatin
(ATOR
10
mg/day)
for
12
weeks
Blood
samplings
for
serum
lipid
and
markers
were
collected
before
after
and
withdrawal
of
statin
treatment
The
total
cholesterol
LDL-cholesterol
and
sVCAM-1
(from
3944+/-2517
to
3210+/-1989
ng/ml
p<005)
all
decreased
significantly
and
the
tPA
(from
947+/-357
to
1162+/-399
ng/ml
p<005)
increased
significantly
after
atorvastatin
treatment
During
the
following
3
days
after
withdrawal
of
atorvastatin
the
total
cholesterol
and
LDL-cholesterol
did
not
show
any
significant
change
However
the
plasma
sVCAM-1
significantly
elevated
on
day
2
(from
3210+/-1989
to
3712+/-2204
ng/ml
p<005)
and
the
plasma
tPA
significantly
decreased
on
day
1
(from
1162+/-399
to
1052+/-355
ng/ml
p<005)
and
day
3
(from
1162+/-399
to
1027+/-369
ng/ml
p<005)
Both
the
significant
elevation
of
sVCAM-1
and
decrease
of
tPA
after
withdrawal
of
atorvastatin
treatment
occurred
within
3
days
while
the
serum
cholesterol
and
LDL-chol
levels
did
not
have
any
significant
change
and
were
still
within
the
therapeutic
range
After
12
weeks
of
atorvastatin
treatment
the
beneficial
pleiotropic
effects
can
be
demonstrated
simultaneously
with
lowering
the
lipid
profile
However
after
withdrawal
of
atorvastatin
the
beneficial
pleiotropic
effects
are
abrogated
rapidly
within
days
and
are
independent
on
elevation
of
serum
cholesterol
