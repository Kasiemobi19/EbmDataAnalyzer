Title
Randomised
trial
comparing
a
policy
of
early
with
selective
amniotomy
in
uncomplicated
labour
at
term
Abstract
Text
To
compare
two
management
policies
rupture
of
the
fetal
membranes
when
women
are
in
normal
labour
or
leave
them
intact
as
long
as
feasible
The
labour
ward
of
a
city
university
hospital
Automated
randomised
clinical
trial
1540
women
in
uncomplicated
term
labour
Data
on
labour
duration
blood
loss
oxytocin
use
and
fetal
condition
were
collected
from
1132
women
Some
data
from
nulliparous
women
has
been
presented
earlier
by
the
UK
Amniotomy
Group
Duration
of
labour
Apgar
score
fetal
morbidity
and
maternal
morbidity
including
perineal
injury
mode
of
delivery
epidural
rates
and
the
total
number
of
vaginal
examinations
in
the
first
stage
of
labour
after
amniotomy
Amniotomy
at
the
next
vaginal
examination
or
amniotomy
only
if
indicated
The
median
cervical
dilatation
at
membrane
rupture
was
2
cm
greater
in
the
first
group
A
policy
of
routine
amniotomy
in
labour
had
no
measurable
advantage
over
selective
amniotomy
for
parous
women
(difference
=
4
min)
but
shortened
labour
in
nulliparous
women
by
1
h
(Mann-Whitney
U
test
P
<
005)
There
was
a
suggestion
of
a
higher
caesarean
section
rate
(OR
19
95%
CI
09-35)
and
there
were
more
vaginal
examinations
after
membrane
rupture
in
the
group
allocated
routine
amniotomy
There
were
no
measurable
differences
in
oxytocin
use
fetal
condition
at
birth
retained
placenta
rates
blood
loss
pain
or
analgesia
requirements
Routine
amniotomy
may
shorten
the
first
labour
but
not
subsequent
ones
There
is
a
suggestion
that
routine
surgical
interference
may
be
harmful
by
increasing
the
risk
of
caesarean
section
and
this
agrees
with
data
from
other
trials
(common
odds
ratio
12
95%
CI
092-16)
