sustained-release
bupropion
a
nicotine

for
smoking
cessation
Abstract
Text
Use
of
nicotine-replacement
therapies
and
the
antidepressant
bupropion
helps
people
stop
smoking
We
conducted
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
comparison
of
sustained-release
bupropion
(244
subjects)
a
nicotine
patch
(244
subjects)
bupropion
and
a
nicotine
patch
(245
subjects)
and
placebo
(160
subjects)
for
smoking
cessation
Smokers
with
clinical
depression
were
excluded
Treatment
consisted
of
nine
weeks
of
bupropion
(150
mg
a
day
for
the
first
three
days
and
then
150
mg
twice
daily)
or
placebo
as
well
as
eight
weeks
of
nicotine-patch
therapy
(21
mg
per
day
during
weeks
2
through
7
14
mg
per
day
during
week
8
and
7
mg
per
day
during
week
9)
or
placebo
The
target
day
for
quitting
smoking
was
usually
day
8
The
abstinence
rates
at
12
months
were
156
percent
in
the
placebo
group
as
compared
with
164
percent
in
the
nicotine-patch
group
303
percent
in
the
bupropion
group
(P<0001)
and
355
percent
in
the
group
given
bupropion
and
the
nicotine
patch
(P<0001)
By
week
7
subjects
in
the
placebo
group
had
gained
an
average
of
21
kg
as
compared
with
a
gain
of
16
kg
in
the
nicotine-patch
group
a
gain
of
17
kg
in
the
bupropion
group
and
a
gain
of
11
kg
in
the
combined-treatment
group
(P<005)
Weight
gain
at
seven
weeks
was
significantly
less
in
the
combined-treatment
group
than
in
the
bupropion
group
and
the
placebo
group
(P<005
for
both
comparisons)
A
total
of
311
subjects
(348
percent)
discontinued
one
or
both
medications
Seventy-nine
subjects
stopped
treatment
because
of
adverse
events
6
in
the
placebo
group
(38
percent)
16
in
the
nicotine-patch
group
(66
percent)
29
in
the
bupropion
group
(119
percent)
and
28
in
the
combined-treatment
group
(114
percent)
The
most
common
adverse
events
were
insomnia
and
headache
Treatment
with
sustained-release
bupropion
alone
or
in
combination
with
a
nicotine
patch
resulted
in
significantly
higher
long-term
rates
of
smoking
cessation
than
use
of
either
the
nicotine
patch
alone
or
placebo
Abstinence
rates
were
higher
with
combination
therapy
than
with
bupropion
alone
but
the
difference
was
not
statistically
significant
