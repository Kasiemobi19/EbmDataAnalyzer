Statin

LDL

C-reactive

coronary

disease
Abstract
Text
Recent
trials
have
demonstrated
better
outcomes
with
intensive
than
with
moderate
statin
treatment
Intensive
treatment
produced
greater
reductions
in
both
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
and
C-reactive
protein
(CRP)
suggesting
a
relationship
between
these
two
biomarkers
and
disease
progression
We
performed
intravascular
ultrasonography
in
502
patients
with
angiographically
documented
coronary
disease
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
moderate
treatment
(40
mg
of
pravastatin
orally
per
day)
or
intensive
treatment
(80
mg
of
atorvastatin
orally
per
day)
Ultrasonography
was
repeated
after
18
months
to
measure
the
progression
of
atherosclerosis
Lipoprotein
and
CRP
levels
were
measured
at
baseline
and
follow-up
In
the
group
as
a
whole
the
mean
LDL
cholesterol
level
was
reduced
from
1502
mg
per
deciliter
(388
mmol
per
liter)
at
baseline
to
945
mg
per
deciliter
(244
mmol
per
liter)
at
18
months
(P<0001)
and
the
geometric
mean
CRP
level
decreased
from
29
to
23
mg
per
liter
(P<0001)
The
correlation
between
the
reduction
in
LDL
cholesterol
levels
and
that
in
CRP
levels
was
weak
but
significant
in
the
group
as
a
whole
(r=013
P=0005)
but
not
in
either
treatment
group
alone
In
univariate
analyses
the
percent
change
in
the
levels
of
LDL
cholesterol
CRP
apolipoprotein
B-100
and
non-high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
were
related
to
the
rate
of
progression
of
atherosclerosis
After
adjustment
for
the
reduction
in
these
lipid
levels
the
decrease
in
CRP
levels
was
independently
and
significantly
correlated
with
the
rate
of
progression
Patients
with
reductions
in
both
LDL
cholesterol
and
CRP
that
were
greater
than
the
median
had
significantly
slower
rates
of
progression
than
patients
with
reductions
in
both
biomarkers
that
were
less
than
the
median
(P=0001)
For
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
the
reduced
rate
of
progression
of
atherosclerosis
associated
with
intensive
statin
treatment
as
compared
with
moderate
statin
treatment
is
significantly
related
to
greater
reductions
in
the
levels
of
both
atherogenic
lipoproteins
and
CRP
