Title
Drug
treatment
of
hyperlipidemia
in
women
Abstract
Text
Several
clinical
trials
have
evaluated
the
effects
of
lipid-lowering
medications
on
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
Many
of
the
trials
have
not
included
enough
women
to
allow
sex-specific
analyses
or
have
not
reported
results
in
women
separately
To
assess
and
synthesize
the
evidence
regarding
drug
treatment
of
hyperlipidemia
for
the
prevention
of
CHD
events
in
women
and
to
conduct
a
meta-analysis
of
the
effect
of
drug
treatment
on
mortality
We
searched
MEDLINE
the
Cochrane
Database
and
the
Database
of
Abstracts
of
Reviews
of
Effectiveness
for
articles
published
from
1966
through
December
2003
We
reviewed
reference
lists
of
articles
and
consulted
content
experts
Studies
of
outpatients
that
had
a
treatment
duration
of
at
least
1
year
assessed
the
impact
of
lipid
lowering
on
clinical
outcomes
and
reported
results
by
sex
were
included
Outcomes
evaluated
were
total
mortality
CHD
mortality
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
revascularization
and
total
CHD
events
Summary
estimates
of
the
relative
risks
(RRs)
with
therapy
were
calculated
using
a
random-effects
model
for
patients
with
and
without
a
previous
history
of
cardiovascular
disease
Thirteen
studies
were
included
Six
trials
included
a
total
of
11
435
women
without
cardiovascular
disease
and
assessed
the
effects
of
lipid-lowering
medications
Lipid
lowering
did
not
reduce
total
mortality
(RR
095
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
062-146)
CHD
mortality
(RR
107
95%
CI
047-240)
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
(RR
061
95%
CI
022-168)
revascularization
(RR
087
95%
CI
033-231)
or
CHD
events
(RR
087
95%
CI
069-109)
However
some
analyses
were
limited
by
too
few
CHD
events
in
the
available
trials
Eight
trials
included
8272
women
with
cardiovascular
disease
and
assessed
the
effects
of
lipid-lowering
medications
Lipid
lowering
did
not
reduce
total
mortality
in
women
with
cardiovascular
disease
(RR
100
95%
CI
077-129)
However
lipid
lowering
reduced
CHD
mortality
(RR
074
95%
CI
055-100)
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
(RR
071
95%
CI
058-087)
revascularization
(RR
070
95%
CI
055-089)
and
total
CHD
events
(RR
080
CI
071-091)
For
women
without
cardiovascular
disease
lipid
lowering
does
not
affect
total
or
CHD
mortality
Lipid
lowering
may
reduce
CHD
events
but
current
evidence
is
insufficient
to
determine
this
conclusively
For
women
with
known
cardiovascular
disease
treatment
of
hyperlipidemia
is
effective
in
reducing
CHD
events
CHD
mortality
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
and
revascularization
but
it
does
not
affect
total
mortality
