Evaluation

12
commercial
tests
for
detection

Epstein-Barr
virus-specific
and
heterophile
antibodies
Abstract
Text
Ten
microbiological
departments
in
Norway
have
participated
in
a
multicenter
evaluation
of
the
following
commercial
tests
for
detection
of
Epstein-Barr
virus
(EBV)-specific
and
heterophile
antibodies
CAPTIA
Select
viral
capsid
antigen
(VCA)-M/G/EBNA
(Centocor
Inc)
Enzygnost
anti-EBV/immunoglobulin
M
(IgM)
and
IgG
(Dade
Behring)
Vironostika
EBV
VCA
IgM/IgG/EBNA
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA)
(Organon
Teknika)
SEROFLUOR
immunofluorescence
assay
and
EBV
Combi-Test
(Institute
Virion
Ltd)
anti-EBV
recombinant
IgM-
and
IgG-early
antigen/EBNA
IgG
ELISA
(Biotest
Diagnostics)
EBV
IgM/IgG/EBNA
ELISA
(Gull
Laboratories)
Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn
test
(Sanofi
Diagnostics
Pasteur)
Monosticon
Dri-Dot
(Organon
Teknika)
Avitex-IM
(Omega
Diagnostics
Ltd)
Alexon
Serascan
infectious
mononucleosis
test
(Alexon
Biomedical
Inc
)
Clearview
IM
(Unipath
Ltd)
and
Cards+/-OS
Mono
(Pacific
Biotech
Inc)
The
test
panel
included
sera
from
patients
with
primary
EBV
infection
immunocompromised
patients
with
recent
cytomegalovirus
infection
healthy
persons
(blood
donors)
and
EBV-seronegative
persons
Among
the
tests
for
EBV-specific
antibodies
the
sensitivity
was
good
with
only
small
differences
between
the
different
assays
However
there
was
a
greater
variation
in
specificity
which
varied
between
100%
(Enzygnost)
and
86%
(Biotest)
Tests
for
detection
of
heterophile
antibodies
based
on
purified
or
selected
antigen
(Avitex
Alexon
Clearview
IM
and
Cards+/-OS
Mono)
were
more
sensitive
than
the
Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn
and
Monosticon
tests
