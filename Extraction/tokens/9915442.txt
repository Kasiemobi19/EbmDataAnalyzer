Abstract
Text
We
compare
noncontrast
enhanced
computerized
tomography
(CT)
and
excretory
urography
(IVP)
in
the
evaluation
of
acute
flank
pain
A
total
of
40
consecutive
patients
presenting
to
the
emergency
department
with
acute
flank
pain
were
evaluated
with
noncontrast
CT
films
of
the
kidneys
ureters
and
bladder
and
IVP
The
patients
were
treated
according
to
the
clinical
picture
All
40
sets
of
evaluations
were
later
assessed
randomly
by
an
independent
consultant
radiologist
for
the
presence
size
and
location
of
a
stone
ureteral
dilatation
and
secondary
signs
of
ureteral
obstruction
Of
40
patients
12
had
no
calculus
and
28
had
a
calculus
confirmed
on
removal
or
documented
passage
of
a
stone
Absence
of
a
stone
was
based
on
clinical
and
radiological
followup
with
clinical
resolution
CT
revealed
all
28
calculi
and
no
calculus
in
11
of
12
patients
with
100%
sensitivity
and
92%
specificity
IVP
demonstrated
18
calculi
(64%
sensitivity)
and
no
calculus
in
11
of
12
patients
(92%
specificity)
Ureteral
obstruction
was
seen
in
28
of
the
40
patients
and
CT
and
IVP
were
equivalent
in
detection
(100%
sensitivity)
Films
of
the
kidneys
ureters
and
bladder
alone
demonstrated
15
of
28
stones
(54%
sensitivity)
Noncontrast
CT
is
an
accurate
safe
rapid
technique
to
assess
acute
flank
pain
and
the
evaluation
of
choice
for
patients
who
would
otherwise
require
IVP
for
diagnosis
