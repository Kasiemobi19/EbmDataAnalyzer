Abstract
Text
Although
it
is
generally
accepted
that
lowering
elevated
serum
levels
of
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
cholesterol
in
patients
with
coronary
heart
disease
is
beneficial
there
are
few
data
to
guide
decisions
about
therapy
for
patients
whose
primary
lipid
abnormality
is
a
low
level
of
high-density
lipoprotein
(HDL)
cholesterol
We
conducted
a
double-blind
trial
comparing
gemfibrozil
(1200
mg
per
day)
with
placebo
in
2531
men
with
coronary
heart
disease
an
HDL
cholesterol
level
of
40
mg
per
deciliter
(10
mmol
per
liter)
or
less
and
an
LDL
cholesterol
level
of
140
mg
per
deciliter
(36
mmol
per
liter)
or
less
The
primary
study
outcome
was
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
or
death
from
coronary
causes
The
median
follow-up
was
51
years
At
one
year
the
mean
HDL
cholesterol
level
was
6
percent
higher
the
mean
triglyceride
level
was
31
percent
lower
and
the
mean
total
cholesterol
level
was
4
percent
lower
in
the
gemfibrozil
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
LDL
cholesterol
levels
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
groups
A
primary
event
occurred
in
275
of
the
1267
patients
assigned
to
placebo
(217
percent)
and
in
219
of
the
1264
patients
assigned
to
gemfibrozil
(173
percent)
The
overall
reduction
in
the
risk
of
an
event
was
44
percentage
points
and
the
reduction
in
relative
risk
was
22
percent
(95
percent
confidence
interval
7
to
35
percent
P=0006)
We
observed
a
24
percent
reduction
in
the
combined
outcome
of
death
from
coronary
heart
disease
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
and
stroke
(P<
0001)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
rates
of
coronary
revascularization
hospitalization
for
unstable
angina
death
from
any
cause
and
cancer
Gemfibrozil
therapy
resulted
in
a
significant
reduction
in
the
risk
of
major
cardiovascular
events
in
patients
with
coronary
disease
whose
primary
lipid
abnormality
was
a
low
HDL
cholesterol
level
The
findings
suggest
that
the
rate
of
coronary
events
is
reduced
by
raising
HDL
cholesterol
levels
and
lowering
levels
of
triglycerides
without
lowering
LDL
cholesterol
levels
