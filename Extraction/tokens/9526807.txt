Title
Hypertriglyceridemia
as
a
cardiovascular
risk
factor
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
relation
between
plasma
triglyceride
levels
and
the
risk
of
incident
cardiovascular
disease
the
semiquantitative
techniques
of
meta-analysis
were
applied
to
17
population-based
prospective
studies
of
triglyceride
and
cardiovascular
disease
Sixteen
of
these
studies
represented
2445
events
among
46413
Caucasian
men
followed
for
an
average
period
of
84
years
and
5
studies
represented
439
events
among
10864
Caucasian
women
followed
for
an
average
period
of
114
years
Univariate
relative
risk
(RR)
estimates
for
incident
cardiovascular
disease
associated
with
a
1-mmol/L
increase
in
triglyceride
was
107-198
in
men
with
a
summary
RR
of
132
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
126-139)
indicating
a
32%
increase
in
disease
risk
associated
with
increased
triglyceride
In
the
studies
involving
women
individual
RR
estimates
for
triglyceride
were
169-205
with
a
summary
RR
of
176
(95%
CI
150-207)
indicating
a
76%
increase
in
disease
risk
associated
with
increased
triglyceride
After
adjustment
for
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
and
other
risk
factors
these
risks
were
decreased
to
14%
in
men
and
37%
in
women
but
remained
statistically
significant
Three
recent
prospective
epidemiologic
studies
have
also
shown
that
plasma
triglyceride
and
low-density
lipoprotein
particle
size
predict
subsequent
coronary
artery
disease
in
Caucasian
populations
Taken
together
these
studies
demonstrate
the
importance
of
triglyceride
levels
as
a
risk
factor
for
cardiovascular
disease
