Abstract
Text
Plasma
levels
of
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
at
entry
and
subsequent
changes
from
these
baseline
levels
were
inversely
predictive
of
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
end
points
in
hypercholesterolemic
men
followed
for
7
to
10
years
in
the
Lipid
Research
Clinics
Coronary
Primary
Prevention
Trial
especially
in
the
1907
participants
receiving
cholestyramine
When
the
men
in
this
cohort
were
compared
each
1
mg/dl
increment
in
baseline
HDL-C
(mean
443
mg/dl)
was
associated
with
a
55%
decrement
in
risk
of
"definite"
CHD
death
or
myocardial
infarction
(Z
=
-54)
and
each
1
mg/dl
increase
from
baseline
HDL-C
levels
(mean
increase
=
16
mg/dl)
during
the
trial
was
associated
with
a
44%
risk
reduction
(Z
=
-22)
In
the
1899
participants
receiving
placebo
the
corresponding
risk
decrements
were
34%
and
11%
Although
baseline
HDL-C
level
(mean
=
444
mg/dl)
remained
a
significant
risk
predictor
(Z
=
-38)
in
the
placebo
cohort
increases
in
HDL-C
(mean
increase
05
mg/dl)
were
not
significantly
predictive
of
CHD
(Z
=
-06)
unless
"suspect"
as
well
as
"definite"
end
points
were
analyzed
(Z
=
-20)
When
the
associations
between
HDL-C
(baseline
plus
change)
and
incidence
of
definite
CHD
end
points
within
each
treatment
cohort
were
compared
their
difference
approached
nominal
significance
(Z
=
19)
The
results
suggest
a
synergistic
interaction
in
which
cholestyramine
treatment
reduced
CHD
risk
most
substantially
in
men
maintaining
the
highest
HDL-C
levels
