Return
of
fertility
in
nulliparous
women
after
discontinuation
of
the
intrauterine
device
comparison
with
women
discontinuing
other
methods
of
contraception
Abstract
Text
To
clarify
the
effect
of
the
using
the
intrauterine
device
on
fertility
in
nulliparous
women
Prospective
cohort
study
of
two
groups
of
nulliparous
women
one
recruited
while
using
an
intrauterine
device
and
the
other
while
using
an
oral
contraceptive
Seventeen
family
planning
clinics
in
England
and
Scotland
1071
nulliparous
married
women
aged
18-40
years
558
of
whom
contributed
information
to
the
main
objective
of
the
study
The
women
were
recruited
between
1982
and
1985
and
followed
up
annually
to
1994
Dates
and
reasons
for
any
contraceptive
method
changes
(which
were
most
frequently
to
barrier
methods)
were
recorded
together
with
the
outcome
of
any
pregnancies
at
each
follow
up
The
number
of
nulliparous
women
giving
birth
at
term
after
stopping
contraception
(oral
contraceptive
intrauterine
device
or
barrier
method)
in
order
to
conceive
Women
who
stopped
using
a
barrier
method
to
achieve
a
planned
pregnancy
conceived
most
quickly
54%
were
delivered
after
one
year
vs
39%
of
intrauterine
device
and
32%
of
oral
contraceptive
users
(log
rank
P
=
0002)
There
was
no
association
between
fertility
and
duration
of
oral
contraceptive
use
However
short
term
intrauterine
device
users
(<
42
months)
showed
a
fertility
pattern
more
favourable
than
seen
in
those
discontinuing
oral
contraceptives
with
increasing
duration
of
intrauterine
device
use
being
associated
with
decreasing
fertility
(linear
trend
P
=
0005)
the
fertility
of
women
who
had
used
the
intrauterine
device
for
78
+
months
was
the
most
impaired
(28%
were
delivered
by
12
months
vs
46%
of
short
term
users
at
36
months
the
corresponding
figures
were
79%
vs
91%)
This
association
remained
after
adjusting
for
potential
confounding
factors
including
maternal
age
husband's
social
class
and
history
of
gynaecological
illnesses
factors
which
themselves
had
independent
associations
with
fertility
Long
term
intrauterine
device
use
in
nulliparous
women
appears
to
be
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
fertility
impairment
