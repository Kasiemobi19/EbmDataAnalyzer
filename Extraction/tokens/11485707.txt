Title
A
randomized
controlled
trial
of
telephone
management
of
suspected
urinary
tract
infections
in
women
Abstract
Text
Although
urinary
tract
infections
(UTIs)
in
otherwise
healthy
ambulatory
women
are
often
managed
over
the
telephone
there
has
been
no
systematic
evaluation
of
this
approach
Our
objective
was
to
compare
the
outcomes
of
uncomplicated
UTIs
in
healthy
women
managed
over
the
telephone
with
those
managed
in
the
office
We
randomly
assigned
women
calling
their
usual
provider
with
a
suspected
UTI
to
receive
care
over
the
telephone
(n=36)
or
usual
office-based
care
(n=36)
All
women
had
urinalyses
and
urine
cultures
All
were
treated
with
7
days
of
antibiotics
We
compared
symptom
scores
at
baseline
and
at
day
3
and
day
10
after
therapy
We
also
compared
patient
satisfaction
at
the
end
of
the
study
The
settings
were
family
practices
in
Michigan
We
included
healthy
nonpregnant
women
older
than
18
years
A
total
of
201
women
with
suspected
UTIs
called
their
physician
Of
these
99
were
ineligible
and
30
declined
to
participate
The
women
were
young
(mean
age=366
years)
and
predominantly
white
(86%)
Sixty-four
percent
of
the
urine
cultures
had
significant
growth
of
a
single
organism
We
observed
no
difference
in
symptom
scores
or
satisfaction
Overall
satisfaction
was
high
Short-term
outcomes
of
managing
suspected
UTIs
by
telephone
appear
to
be
comparable
with
usual
office
care
