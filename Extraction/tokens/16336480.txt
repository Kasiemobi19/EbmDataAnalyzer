Predicting
aberrant
behaviors
in
opioid-treated
patients
preliminary
validation
of
the
Opioid
Risk
Tool
Abstract
Text
To
provide
clinicians
with
a
brief
screening
tool
to
predict
accurately
which
individuals
may
develop
aberrant
behaviors
when
prescribed
opioids
for
chronic
pain
One
hundred
and
eighty-five
consecutive
new
patients
treated
in
one
pain
clinic
took
the
self-administered
Opioid
Risk
Tool
(ORT)
The
ORT
measured
the
following
risk
factors
associated
in
scientific
literature
with
substance
abuse
personal
and
family
history
of
substance
abuse
age
history
of
preadolescent
sexual
abuse
and
certain
psychological
diseases
Patients
received
scores
of
0-3
(low
risk)
4-7
(moderate
risk)
or
>or=
8
(high
risk)
indicating
the
probability
of
their
displaying
opioid-related
aberrant
behaviors
All
patients
were
monitored
for
aberrant
behaviors
for
12
months
after
their
initial
visits
For
those
patients
with
a
risk
category
of
low
17
out
of
18
(944%)
did
not
display
an
aberrant
behavior
For
those
patients
with
a
risk
category
of
high
40
out
of
44
(909%)
did
display
an
aberrant
behavior
The
authors
used
the
c
statistic
to
validate
the
ORT
because
it
simultaneously
assesses
sensitivity
and
specificity
The
ORT
displayed
excellent
discrimination
for
both
the
male
(c
=
082)
and
the
female
(c
=
085)
prognostic
models
In
a
preliminary
study
among
patients
prescribed
opioids
for
chronic
pain
the
ORT
exhibited
a
high
degree
of
sensitivity
and
specificity
for
determining
which
individuals
are
at
risk
for
opioid-related
aberrant
behaviors
Further
studies
in
a
variety
of
pain
and
nonpain
settings
are
needed
to
determine
the
ORT's
universal
applicability
