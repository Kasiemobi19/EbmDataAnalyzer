Abstract
Text
To
study
the
effectiveness
and
safety
aspects
of
sodium
valproate
in
the
management
of
painful
neuropathy
in
patients
of
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
A
randomized
double-blind
placebo
controlled
trial
of
sodium
valproate
was
done
in
type
2
diabetic
patients
to
assess
its
efficacy
and
safety
in
the
management
of
painful
neuropathy
We
screened
60
patients
but
eight
patients
could
not
complete
the
study
hence
the
present
study
was
done
on
52
patients
Each
patient
was
assessed
by
clinical
examination
pain
score
by
short
form
of
the
McGill
pain
questionnaire
(SF-MPQ)
and
electrophysiological
examination
which
included
motor
and
sensory
nerve
conduction
velocity
amplitude
and
H-reflex
initially
and
at
the
end
of
1
month
of
treatment
Significant
improvement
was
noticed
in
the
pain
score
of
patients
receiving
sodium
valproate
in
comparison
to
patients
receiving
placebo
at
the
end
of
1
month
(P
<
005)
The
changes
in
electrophysiological
data
were
not
significant
The
drug
was
well
tolerated
by
all
patients
except
one
who
developed
a
raised
aspartate
transaminase
(AST)/alanine
transaminase
(ALT)
level
after
15
days
of
treatment
Sodium
valproate
is
a
well-tolerated
drug
and
provides
significant
subjective
improvement
in
painful
diabetic
neuropathy
These
data
provide
a
basis
for
future
trials
of
longer
duration
in
a
larger
group
of
patients
