Effect
of
growth

treatment
on
adult

in
peripubertal
children
with

a

Abstract
Text
GH
is
often
used
to
treat
children
with
idiopathic
short
stature
despite
the
lack
of
definitive
long-term
studies
of
efficacy
We
performed
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
to
determine
the
effect
of
GH
on
adult
height
in
peripubertal
children
Subjects
(n
=
68
53
males
and
15
females)
9-16
yr
old
with
marked
idiopathic
short
stature
[height
or
predicted
height
<
or
=
-25
sd
score
(SDS)]
received
either
GH
(0074
mg/kg)
or
placebo
sc
three
times
per
week
until
they
were
near
adult
height
At
study
termination
adult
height
measurements
were
available
for
33
patients
after
mean
treatment
duration
of
44
yr
Adult
height
was
greater
in
the
GH-treated
group
(-181
+/-
011
SDS
least
squares
mean
+/-
sem)
than
in
the
placebo-treated
group
(-232
+/-
017
SDS)
by
051
SDS
(37
cm
P
<
002
95%
confidence
interval
010-092
SDS)
A
similar
GH
effect
was
demonstrated
in
terms
of
adult
height
SDS
minus
baseline
height
SDS
and
adult
height
SDS
minus
baseline
predicted
height
SDS
Modified
intent-to-treat
analysis
in
62
patients
treated
for
at
least
6
months
indicated
a
similar
GH
effect
on
last
observed
height
SDS
(052
SDS
38
cm
P
<
0001
95%
confidence
interval

SDS)
and
no
important
dropout
bias
In
conclusion
GH
treatment
increases
adult
height
in
peripubertal
children
with
marked
idiopathic
short
stature
