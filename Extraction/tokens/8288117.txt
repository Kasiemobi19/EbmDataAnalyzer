Systemic
reactions
to
immunotherapy
Abstract
Text
Systemic
anaphylactic
reactions
occur
in
a
small
percentage
of
patients
receiving
allergen
immunotherapy
A
1
year
study
was
performed
in
a
large
health
maintenance
organization
to
determine
the
incidence
of
systemic
reactions
(SR)
to
allergen
immunotherapy
We
measured
the
number
of
SR
that
occurred
during
a
12
months
period
A
SR
data
sheet
was
completed
for
each
reaction
documenting
the
time
of
onset
symptoms
treatment
history
of
asthma
or
previous
reaction
and
concentration
and
type
of
extract
Twenty-seven
thousand
eight
hundred
six
injection
visits
resulted
in
143
SR
(051%)
Forty-five
percent
of
the
patients
(pts)
with
SR
had
a
history
of
prior
SR
50%
had
a
history
of
asthma
and
36%
developed
reactions
in
season
Seventy-two
percent
of
SR
started
within
30
minutes
although
8%
appeared
after
2
hours
Fifty-seven
percent
of
SR
occurred
at
concentrations
of
1000-10000
PNU/cc
25%
at
10-100
PNU/cc
and
17%
when
both
concentrations
were
given
at
the
same
visit
Eighty-three
percent
of
SR
were
judged
to
be
mild
nonlife
threatening
reactions
requiring
no
treatment
or
antihistamine
therapy
only
Seventeen
percent
were
judged
to
be
more
severe
requiring
treatment
with
epinephrine
with
or
without
other
agents
SR
are
a
small
but
definite
risk
of
immunotherapy
Most
SR
are
mild
but
some
may
be
life
threatening
The
majority
of
reactions
occur
within
30
minutes
but
significant
reactions
may
occur
after
2
hours
A
large
percentage
of
SR
occurred
in
patients
with
a
history
of
asthma
previous
SR
or
both
