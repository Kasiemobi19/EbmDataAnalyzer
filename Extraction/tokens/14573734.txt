Absence
of
cross-reactivity
between
sulfonamide
antibiotics
and
sulfonamide
nonantibiotics
Abstract
Text
The
safety
of
sulfonamide
nonantibiotics
is
unclear
in
patients
with
prior
allergic
reactions
to
sulfonamide
antibiotics
We
conducted
a
retrospective
cohort
study
using
the
General
Practice
Research
Database
in
the
United
Kingdom
examining
the
risk
of
allergic
reactions
within
30
days
after
the
receipt
of
a
sulfonamide
nonantibiotic
Patients
with
evidence
of
prior
hypersensitivity
after
the
receipt
of
a
sulfonamide
antibiotic
were
compared
with
those
without
such
evidence
Similar
analyses
were
also
performed
with
the
use
of
penicillins
instead
of
sulfonamides
to
determine
whether
any
risk
was
specific
to
sulfonamide
cross-reactivity
Of
969
patients
with
an
allergic
reaction
after
a
sulfonamide
antibiotic
96
(99
percent)
had
an
allergic
reaction
after
subsequently
receiving
a
sulfonamide
nonantibiotic
Of
19257
who
had
no
allergic
reaction
after
a
sulfonamide
antibiotic
315
(16
percent)
had
an
allergic
reaction
after
receiving
a
sulfonamide
nonantibiotic
(adjusted
odds
ratio
28
95
percent
confidence
interval
21
to
37)
However
the
risk
of
allergic
reactions
was
even
greater
after
the
receipt
of
a
penicillin
among
patients
with
a
prior
hypersensitivity
reaction
to
a
sulfonamide
antibiotic
as
compared
with
patients
with
no
such
history
(adjusted
odds
ratio
39
95
percent
confidence
interval
35
to
43)
Furthermore
among
those
with
a
prior
hypersensitivity
reaction
after
the
receipt
of
a
sulfonamide
antibiotic
the
risk
of
an
allergic
reaction
after
the
subsequent
receipt
of
a
sulfonamide
nonantibiotic
was
lower
than
the
risk
of
an
allergic
reaction
after
the
subsequent
receipt
of
a
penicillin
(adjusted
odds
ratio
07
95
percent
confidence
interval
05
to
09)
Finally
the
risk
of
an
allergic
reaction
after
the
receipt
of
a
sulfonamide
nonantibiotic
was
lower
among
patients
with
a
history
of
hypersensitivity
to
sulfonamide
antibiotics
than
among
patients
with
a
history
of
hypersensitivity
to
penicillins
(adjusted
odds
ratio
06
95
percent
confidence
interval
05
to
08)
There
is
an
association
between
hypersensitivity
after
the
receipt
of
sulfonamide
antibiotics
and
a
subsequent
allergic
reaction
after
the
receipt
of
a
sulfonamide
nonantibiotic
but
this
association
appears
to
be
due
to
a
predisposition
to
allergic
reactions
rather
than
to
cross-reactivity
with
sulfonamide-based
drugs
