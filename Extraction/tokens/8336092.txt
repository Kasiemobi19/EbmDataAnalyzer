Title
Use

CT

for
the

headache
a
report

ASPN
Part

Abstract
Text
Clinicians
in
the
Ambulatory
Sentinel
Practice
Network
(ASPN)
order
computed
tomography
(CT)
scans
for
approximately
3%
of
patients
with
headache
This
study
was
undertaken
to
provide
information
about
the
reasons
for
ordering
CT
scans
and
the
results
obtained
Weekly
return
cards
were
used
to
collect
data
on
every
patient
for
whom
a
CT
scan
was
ordered
to
investigate
a
headache
during
a
19-month
period
Copies
of
CT
reports
were
reviewed
and
a
chart
audit
was
performed
to
collect
further
clinical
information
whenever
an
intracranial
tumor
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
(SAH)
or
subdural
hematoma
(SDH)
was
reported
Clinicians
in
58
practices
ordered
349
CT
scans
Only
52
patients
(15%)
had
abnormalities
noted
on
neurological
examination
Most
CT
scans
were
ordered
because
the
clinician
believed
that
a
tumor
(49%)
or
an
SAH
(9%)
might
be
present
Fifty-nine
(17%)
were
ordered
because
of
patient
expectation
or
medicolegal
concerns
Of
the
293
reports
reviewed
14
indicated
that
a
tumor
an
SAH
or
an
SDH
was
present
Two
of
the
14
(14%)
were
false
positives
Forty-four
(15%)
of
the
reports
noted
incidental
findings
of
questionable
significance
Because
there
are
no
clear
guidelines
for
the
use
of
CT
for
the
investigation
of
headache
physicians
must
exercise
good
clinical
judgment
in
their
attempts
to
identify
treatable
disease
in
a
cost-effective
manner
ASPN
clinicians
made
selective
use
of
CT
scans
based
on
a
combination
of
factors
that
included
physician
and
patient
concerns
CT
was
an
imperfect
tool
in
this
setting
Most
of
the
positive
results
represented
false
positives
or
incidental
findings
that
could
have
led
to
adverse
effects
and
additional
costs
