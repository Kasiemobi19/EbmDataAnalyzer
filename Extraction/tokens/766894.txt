Abstract
Text
Forty
patients
with
diverticular
disease
were
treated
with
wheat
bran
24g/day
for
at
least
six
months
Thirty-three
patients
showed
a
very
satisfactory
clinical
response
Sixty
per
cent
of
all
symptoms
were
abolished
and
a
further
28%
were
relieved
After
treatment
the
transit
times
accelerated
in
patients
whose
initial
times
were
slower
than
60
hours
and
slowed
down
in
those
whose
initial
transit
times
were
faster
than
36
hours
Stool
weight
increased
significantly
The
number
of
intracolonic
high
pressure
waves
decreased
especially
during
and
after
eating
Barium
enema
studies
showed
less
spasm
in
eight
patients
and
no
diverticula
in
three
patients
after
taking
bran
As
well
as
relieving
the
symptoms
of
diverticular
disease
a
high-fibre
diet
may
also
prevent
the
condition
from
developing
