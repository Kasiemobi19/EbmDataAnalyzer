disorder
Abstract
Text
Despite
the
increasing
recognition
of
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
in
adults
the
use
of
pharmacotherapeutics
remains
less
established
A
systematic
review
of
the
literature
identified
15
studies
(N
=
435
subjects)
of
stimulants
and
22
studies
of
non-stimulant
medications
(N
=
421
subjects)
including
antidepressants
antihypertensives
amino
acids
and
wake-promoting
agents
for
the
treatment
of
ADHD
in
adults
Studies
with
stimulants
and
antidepressants
demonstrated
significant
short-term
improvement
in
ADHD
symptoms
compared
to
placebo
in
adults
Methylphenidate
(MPH)
and
amphetamine
had
an
immediate
onset
of
action
whereas
the
ADHD
response
to
pemoline
and
antidepressants
appeared
delayed
The
response
to
amphetamine
and
MPH
appears
to
be
dose-dependent
Controlled
data
on
nicotonic
and
noradrenergic
compounds
appear
promising
There
was
considerable
variability
in
diagnostic
criteria
dosing
parameters
and
response
rates
between
the
various
studies
Under
controlled
conditions
the
aggregate
literature
shows
that
the
stimulants
and
noradrenergic
antidepressants
had
a
clinically
and
statistically
significant
beneficial
effect
on
treating
ADHD
in
adults
