Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
very
early
stroke
risk
after
a
transient
ischaemic
attack
(TIA)
or
minor
stroke
and
thereby
inform
the
planning
of
effective
stroke
prevention
services
Population
based
prospective
cohort
study
of
patients
with
TIA
or
stroke
Nine
general
practices
in
Oxfordshire
England
from
April
2002
to
April
2003
All
patients
who
had
a
TIA
(n
=
87)
or
minor
stroke
(n
=
87)
during
the
study
period
and
who
presented
to
medical
attention
Risk
of
recurrent
stroke
at
seven
days
one
month
and
three
months
after
TIAs
and
minor
strokes
The
estimated
risk
of
recurrent
stroke
was
80%
(95%
confidence
interval
23%
to
137%)
at
seven
days
115%
(48%
to
182%)
at
one
month
and
173%
(93%
to
253%)
at
three
months
after
a
TIA
The
risks
at
these
three
time
periods
after
a
minor
stroke
were
115%
(48%
to
112%)
150%
(75%
to
225%)
and
185%
(103%
to
267%)
The
early
risks
of
stroke
after
a
TIA
or
minor
stroke
are
much
higher
than
commonly
quoted
More
research
is
needed
to
determine
whether
these
risks
can
be
reduced
by
more
rapid
instigation
of
preventive
treatment
