Title
Vaccines
for
preventing
pneumococcal
infection
in
adults
Abstract
Text
Diseases
caused
by
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
(S
pneumoniae)
continue
to
cause
substantial
morbidity
and
mortality
throughout
the
world
Polysaccharide
pneumococcal
vaccines
have
been
developed
for
over
50
years
and
may
have
the
potential
to
prevent
disease
and
death
To
assess
the
effectiveness
of
polysaccharide
pneumococcal
vaccination
in
preventing
disease
or
death
in
adults
Trials
were
identified
by
electronic
searches
of
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL)
issue
2
2003
(which
includes
the
Cochrane
ARI
Group's
specialised
register)
MEDLINE
(January
1966
to
June
2003)
and
EMBASE
(1974
to
June
2003)
We
searched
existing
literature
The
bibliographies
of
all
newly
revealed
studies
were
read
in
order
to
identify
further
studies
The
vaccine
manufacturers
the
lead
authors
of
newly
identified
studies
not
included
in
existing
meta-analyses
were
contacted
A)
Prospective
randomised
or
quasi-randomised
studies
comparing
pneumococcal
vaccines
with
placebo
control
vaccines
or
no
interventionB)
Case-control
studies
(including
indirect
cohort
studies)
assessing
pneumococcal
vaccine
effectiveness
against
invasive
pneumococcal
disease
Cohort
studies
are
excluded
A)
Randomised
studies
Trial
quality
assessment
was
conducted
by
two
reviewers
(JH
and
DT)
Data
extraction
was
done
by
three
reviewers
(JH
DT
KD)
There
were
many
instances
of
unclear
or
incomplete
data
in
the
trial
reports
and
the
final
dataset
was
arrived
at
after
much
deliberation
and
discussion
including
comparison
with
the
data
used
in
two
previous
reviews
of
this
question
Due
to
the
age
of
the
trials
(dating
back
to
1954
in
one
case)
it
was
not
generally
possible
to
obtain
clarification
from
the
authors
though
a
partial
clarification
was
achieved
in
one
caseB)
Non-randomised
studies
Study
quality
was
assessed
by
two
reviewers
(RA
and
KD)
The
combined
results
from
the
randomised
studies
fail
to
show
that
the
polysaccharide
pneumococcal
vaccine
is
effective
in
preventing
either
pneumonia
(outcome

odds
ratio
=
077
confidence
interval

or
death
(outcome

odds
ratio
090
confidence
interval
076
107
number
=

Despite
encouraging
data
from
some
very
early
trials
pooling
trials
published
from
1977
on
suggests
there
is
no
effect
(outcome

odds
ratio

The
available
data
cannot
distinguish
whether
this
heterogeneity
in
results
is
due
to
improvements
in
trial
methodology
and
reporting
to
differences
in
trial
setting
or
to
real
loss
of
efficacy
over
time
This
is
because
the
early
poorly
reported
trials
were
conducted
in
high-risk
healthy
populations
where
the
expected
benefit
is
greatest
The
case-control
studies
show
significant
efficacy
in
preventing
invasive
pneumococcal
disease
OR

(CI

corresponding
to
an
efficacy
of
53%
While
polysaccharide
pneumococcal
vaccines
do
not
appear
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
pneumonia
or
death
in
adults
with
or
without
chronic
illness
or
in
the
elderly
(55
years
and
above)
the
evidence
from
non-randomised
studies
suggests
that
the
vaccines
are
effective
in
the
reducing
the
incidence
of
the
more
specific
outcome
invasive
pneumococcal
disease
among
adults
and
the
immunocompetent
elderly
(55
years
and
above)
Surveillance
data
suggest
that
infection
rates
vary
widely
between
and
also
within
countries
but
a
typical
figure
in
developed
countries
is
001%
or
10
per
100000
per
year
Efficacy
of
50%
then
corresponds
to
a
number-needed-to-treat
(NNT)
of
20000
vaccinations
per
infection
avoided
and
perhaps
50000
per
death
avoided
