Abstract
Text
The
objective
of
this
paper
was
to
evaluate
the
cardiovascular
risk
in
white
coat
hypertension
(WCH)
WCH
is
a
well-known
clinical
entity
defined
by
persistently
elevated
blood
pressure
(BP)
in
the
doctor's
office
whereas
BP
in
other
conditions
is
normal
The
prognosis
of
WCH
is
unsettled
although
two
prospective
studies
that
include
normal
control
groups
imply
that
the
condition
is
benign
This
study
is
a
10-year
follow-up
study
on
420
patients
with
grade
I-II
hypertension
newly
diagnosed
by
their
general
practitioner
and
146
normal
controls
(NTs)
Ambulatory
blood
pressure
(ABP)
monitoring
was
performed
at
baseline
With
our
protocollated
cutoff
value
of
daytime-ABP
<135/90
mmHg
76
(181%)
of
the
420
hypertensives
were
white
coat
hypertensives
(WCHs)
and
344
were
established
hypertensives
(EHs)
With
a
lower
cutoff
of
135/85
mmHg
40
(95%)
were
WCHs
Complete
follow-up
data
were
obtained
for
all
566
subjects
The
mean
duration
of
follow-up
was
102
years
(range
90-125)
In
the
WCH
group
14
first
events
were
recorded
(184%)
consisting
of
two
cardiovascular
deaths
and
12
nonfatal
cardiovascular
events
In
the
EH
group
the
corresponding
number
of
events
were
56
first
events
(163%)
12
cardiovascular
deaths
and
44
nonfatal
cardiovascular
events
and
in
the
NT
group
10
first
events
(68%)
two
cardiovascular
deaths
and
eight
nonfatal
cardiovascular
events
The
event
rate
was
similar
in
the
WCH
group
and
the
EH
group
and
significantly
lower
in
the
NT
group
(P<005)
When
corrected
for
daytime-ABP
age
and
other
confounders
the
difference
remained
statistically
significant
When
using
the
lower
cutoff
of
135/85
mmHg
WCH
was
still
associated
with
a
significantly
higher
cardiovascular
event
rate
In
conclusion
the
main
finding
of
this
10-year
follow-up
study
is
an
increased
cardiovascular
risk
in
WCH
compared
to
normotensive
controls
