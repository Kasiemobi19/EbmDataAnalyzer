From
a
prospective
study
of
chronic
cough
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
aspects
in
older
adults
Abstract
Text
Cough
is
the
most
common
complaint
for
which
adults
see
a
physician
in
the
ambulatory
setting
in
the
United
States
An
anatomical
diagnostic
protocol
has
been
used
since
1981
to
evaluate
patients
with
chronic
cough
It
has
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
diagnosing
the
cause
of
cough
and
leading
to
specific
treatment
in
a
variety
of
adult
populations
but
has
never
been
evaluated
specifically
in
a
population
of
older
adults
To
question
whether
the
spectrum
and
frequency
of
causes
of
chronic
cough
and
the
response
to
therapy
would
be
different
in
older
adults
Thirty
patients
at
least
64
years
of
age
with
a
history
of
cough
lasting
at
least
3
weeks
were
prospectively
evaluated
with
a
protocol
designed
to
detect
diseases
that
stimulate
the
afferent
limb
of
the
cough
reflex
The
final
diagnosis
of
the
cause
of
chronic
cough
required
fulfillment
of
pretreatment
criteria
and
having
cough
disappear
with
specific
therapy
When
more
than
one
disease
fulfilled
pretreatment
diagnostic
criteria
therapy
was
instituted
in
the
order
that
these
were
fulfilled
Probability
statistics
were
used
to
describe
the
testing
characteristics
of
individual
components
of
the
diagnostic
protocol
in
terms
of
sensitivity
specificity
positive
predictive
value
and
negative
predictive
value
as
they
applied
to
chronic
cough
Forty
causes
of
chronic
cough
were
identified
in
all
30
patients
Postnasal
drip
syndrome
gastroesophageal
reflux
disease
and
asthma
were
the
most
common
causes
of
chronic
cough
accounting
for
85%
of
all
causes
found
Among
patients
with
normal
chest
radiograph
findings
who
were
not
cigarette
smokers
and
not
taking
an
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
postnasal
drip
syndrome
gastroesophageal
reflux
disease
and
asthma
accounted
for
100%
of
all
causes
found
Specific
therapy
was
successful
in
eliminating
chronic
cough
in
100%
of
the
patients
studied
Except
for
barium
esophagography
all
laboratory
tests
for
which
information
was
available
had
sensitivities
and
negative
predictive
values
of
100%
Postnasal
drip
syndrome
gastroesophageal
reflux
disease
and
asthma
accounted
for
85%
of
all
causes
of
chronic
cough
in
older
adults
Chronic
cough
caused
substantial
physical
and
emotional
morbidity
among
older
patients
The
major
value
of
performing
objective
testing
in
evaluating
chronic
cough
is
its
ability
to
rule
out
specific
diseases
as
a
diagnostic
possibility
The
following
clinical
profile
consistently
predicts
patients
with
cough
attributable
to
gastroesophageal
reflux
disease
the
patient
has
cough
that
has
been
persistently
troublesome
for
at
least
3
weeks
does
not
smoke
cigarettes
does
not
take
an
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
does
not
have
or
has
not
responded
to
therapy
for
postnasal
drip
syndrome
and
asthma
and
has
normal
or
nearly
normal
findings
and
stable
chest
radiograph
The
differences
between
what
we
observed
regarding
chronic
cough
in
older
adults
and
observations
by
ourselves
and
others
regarding
chronic
cough
in
general
are
minor
