Abstract
Text
Plasma
homocysteine
level
has
been
recognized
as
an
important
cardiovascular
risk
factor
that
predicts
adverse
cardiac
events
in
patients
with
established
coronary
atherosclerosis
and
influences
restenosis
rate
after
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
To
evaluate
the
effect
of
homocysteine-lowering
therapy
on
clinical
outcome
after
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
Randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
involving
553
patients
referred
to
the
University
Hospital
in
Bern
Switzerland
from
May
1998
to
April
1999
and
enrolled
after
successful
angioplasty
of
at
least
1
significant
coronary
stenosis
(>
or
=
50%)
Participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
a
combination
of
folic
acid
(1
mg/d)
vitamin
B12
(cyanocobalamin
400
micro
g/d)
and
vitamin
B6
(pyridoxine
hydrochloride
10
mg/d)
(n
=
272)
or
placebo
(n
=
281)
for
6
months
Composite
end
point
of
major
adverse
events
defined
as
death
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
and
need
for
repeat
revascularization
evaluated
at
6
months
and
1
year
After
a
mean
(SD)
follow-up
of
11
(3)
months
the
composite
end
point
was
significantly
lower
at
1
year
in
patients
treated
with
homocysteine-lowering
therapy
(154%
vs
228%
relative
risk
[RR]
068
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
048-096
P
=03)
primarily
due
to
a
reduced
rate
of
target
lesion
revascularization
(99%
vs
160%
RR
062
95%
CI
040-097
P
=03)
A
nonsignificant
trend
was
seen
toward
fewer
deaths
(15%
vs
28%
RR
054
95%
CI
016-170
P
=27)
and
nonfatal
myocardial
infarctions
(26%
vs
43%
RR
060
95%
CI
024-151
P
=27)
with
homocysteine-lowering
therapy
These
findings
remained
unchanged
after
adjustment
for
potential
confounders
Homocysteine-lowering
therapy
with
folic
acid
vitamin
B12
and
vitamin
B6
significantly
decreases
the
incidence
of
major
adverse
events
after
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
