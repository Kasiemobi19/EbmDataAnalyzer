Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
vitamin
B-6
in
the
treatment
of
premenstrual
syndrome
Systematic
review
of
published
and
unpublished
randomised
placebo
controlled
trials
of
the
effectiveness
of
vitamin
B-6
in
the
management
of
premenstrual
syndrome
Nine
published
trials
representing
940
patients
with
premenstrual
syndrome
Proportion
of
women
whose
overall
premenstrual
symptoms
showed
an
improvement
over
placebo
A
secondary
analysis
was
performed
on
the
proportion
of
women
whose
premenstrual
depressive
symptoms
showed
an
improvement
over
placebo
Odds
ratio
relative
to
placebo
for
an
improvement
in
overall
premenstrual
symptoms
was
232
(95%
confidence
interval
195
to
254)
Odds
ratio
relative
to
placebo
for
an
improvement
in
depressive
symptoms
was
169
(139
to
206)
from
four
trials
representing
541
patients
Conclusions
are
limited
by
the
low
quality
of
most
of
the
trials
included
Results
suggest
that
doses
of
vitamin
B-6
up
to
100
mg/day
are
likely
to
be
of
benefit
in
treating
premenstrual
symptoms
and
premenstrual
depression
