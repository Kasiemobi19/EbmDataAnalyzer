Abstract
Text
It
is
known
that
obesity
sodium
intake
and
alcohol
consumption
factors
influence
blood
pressure
In
this
clinical
trial
Dietary
Approaches
to
Stop
Hypertension
we
assessed
the
effects
of
dietary
patterns
on
blood
pressure
We
enrolled
459
adults
with
systolic
blood
pressures
of
less
than
160
mm
Hg
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
of
80
to
95
mm
Hg
For
three
weeks
the
subjects
were
fed
a
control
diet
that
was
low
in
fruits
vegetables
and
dairy
products
with
a
fat
content
typical
of
the
average
diet
in
the
United
States
They
were
then
randomly
assigned
to
receive
for
eight
weeks
the
control
diet
a
diet
rich
in
fruits
and
vegetables
or
a
"combination"
diet
rich
in
fruits
vegetables
and
low-fat
dairy
products
and
with
reduced
saturated
and
total
fat
Sodium
intake
and
body
weight
were
maintained
at
constant
levels
At
base
line
the
mean
(+/-SD)
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
were
1313+/-108
mm
Hg
and
847+/-47
mm
Hg
respectively
The
combination
diet
reduced
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
by
55
and
30
mm
Hg
more
respectively
than
the
control
diet
(P<0001
for
each)
the
fruits-and-vegetables
diet
reduced
systolic
blood
pressure
by
28
mm
Hg
more
(P<0001)
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
by
11
mm
Hg
more
than
the
control
diet
(P=007)
Among
the
133
subjects
with
hypertension
(systolic
pressure
>
or
=140
mm
Hg
diastolic
pressure
>
or
=90
mm
Hg
or
both)
the
combination
diet
reduced
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
by
114
and
55
mm
Hg
more
respectively
than
the
control
diet
(P<0001
for
each)
among
the
326
subjects
without
hypertension
the
corresponding
reductions
were
35
mm
Hg
(P<0001)
and
21
mm
Hg
(P=0003)
A
diet
rich
in
fruits
vegetables
and
low-fat
dairy
foods
and
with
reduced
saturated
and
total
fat
can
substantially
lower
blood
pressure
This
diet
offers
an
additional
nutritional
approach
to
preventing
and
treating
hypertension
