Title
Infant
fatness
and
feeding
practices
a
longitudinal
assessment
Abstract
Text
In
recent
years
bottle
feeding
and
the
early
introduction
of
solid
foods
in
infants'
diets
have
been
proposed
as
factors
contributing
to
overweight
in
infancy
that
might
continue
into
childhood
These
hypotheses
were
examined
in
a
longitudinal
survey
of
403
infants
from
birth
to
18
months
of
age
Results
from
this
survey
do
not
support
either
(a)
a
relationship
between
type
of
milk
feeding
or
time
of
introduction
of
solid
food
and
fatness
at
6
months
of
age
or
(b)
the
hypothesis
that
fat
infants
remain
fat
