A
prospective

pilot
evaluation
of
topical
triple
antibiotic
versus
mupirocin
for
the
prevention
of
uncomplicated
soft
tissue
wound
infection
Abstract
Text
Little
data
exists
comparing
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
triple
antibiotic
ointment
(TAO)
and
mupirocin
for
prevention
of
uncomplicated
soft
tissue
wound
infections
The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
conduct
a
pilot
study
of
the
relative
safety
efficacy
and
cost
effectiveness
of
the
2
preparations
This
was
a
randomized
prospective
interventional
study
to
determine
the
difference
in
infection
rates
of
uncomplicated
soft
tissue
wounds
between
subjects
treated
with
TAO
and
mupirocin
ointment
after
standard
wound
care
and
suturing
Subjects
were
enrolled
at
presentation
to
the
ED
if
they
met
the
study
inclusion
criteria
and
were
required
to
make
one
follow-up
visit
to
the
ED
to
determine
the
status
of
their
wound
(infected
vs
not
infected)
A
total
of
99
patients
were
enrolled
and
assessed
at
the
follow-up
visit
The
groups
had
similar
rates
of
self-reported
compliance
with
wound
care
and
dressing
changes
Patients
in
the
mupirocin
group
had
a
greater
rate
of
signs
of
infection
(12%
vs
61%)
and
infection
(4%
vs
0%)
compared
with
patients
in
the
TAO
group
although
neither
difference
achieved
statistical
significance
There
were
no
serious
adverse
effects
in
either
group
This
pilot
study
found
a
similar
rate
of
wound
infection
and
adverse
events
between
TAO
and
mupirocin
ointments
Results
should
be
confirmed
in
a
larger
equivalency
trial
