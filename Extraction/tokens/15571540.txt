Subjective
memory
deterioration
and
future
dementia
in
people
aged
65
and
older
Abstract
Text
To
study
whether
subjective
memory
deterioration
is
associated
with
future
dementia
in
older
people
A
population-based
prospective
cohort
study
begun
in
1994
with
biennial
follow-up
interviews
Community-based
members
of
Group
Health
Cooperative
a
large
health
maintenance
organization
in
the
Seattle
area
A
sample
of
1883
subjects
dementia
free
aged
65
and
older
who
scored
91
or
higher
on
the
100-point
Cognitive
Ability
Screening
Instrument
(CASI)
at
study
entry
Subjective
memory
was
assessed
by
asking
whether
memory
had
changed
on
5-point
Likert
scales
(eg
1=definitely
improved
3=no
change
5=definitely
deteriorated)
with
regard
to
five
items
remembering
names
faces
friends
and
appointments
and
judging
the
time
The
items
were
summed
for
a
possible
total
score
ranging
from
5
to
25
Subjective
memory
deterioration
was
defined
as
present
if
the
total
score
was
20
or
above
Cognitive
performance
was
measured
using
the
CASI
Incident
dementia
cases
were
identified
using
Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manual
of
Mental
Disorders
Fourth
Edition
criteria
Of
1883
subjects
126
developed
dementia
during
5
years
of
follow-up
Subjective
memory
deterioration
was
associated
with
cognitive
decline
and
incident
dementia
Age
modified
the
association
between
subjective
memory
deterioration
and
future
dementia
For
persons
reporting
subjective
memory
deterioration
at
the
ages
of
70
75
and
80
the
hazard
ratios
of
developing
dementia
were
60
(95%
confidence
interval
(CI)=21-18)
32
(95%
CI=16-62)
and
16
(95%
CI=086-31)
respectively
Subjective
memory
deterioration
was
found
to
precede
the
development
of
dementia
in
older
people
with
normal
cognitive
screening
results
These
findings
suggest
that
a
high
level
of
subjective
memory
deterioration
in
persons
with
normal
objective
cognitive
function
may
identify
a
subset
of
individuals
at
greater
risk
for
developing
dementia
