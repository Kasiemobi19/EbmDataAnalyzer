Abstract
Text
Vitamin
E
(alpha-tocopherol)
is
thought
to
have
a
role
in
prevention
of
atherosclerosis
through
inhibition
of
oxidation
of
low-density
lipoprotein
Some
epidemiological
studies
have
shown
an
association
between
high
dietary
intake
or
high
serum
concentrations
of
alpha-tocopherol
and
lower
rates
of
ischaemic
heart
disease
We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
treatment
with
a
high
dose
of
alpha-tocopherol
would
reduce
subsequent
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
(MI)
and
cardiovascular
death
in
patients
with
established
ischaemic
heart
disease
In
this
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
with
stratified
randomisation
2002
patients
with
angiographically
proven
coronary
atherosclerosis
were
enrolled
and
followed
up
for
a
median
of
510
days
(range
3-981)
1035
patients
were
assigned
alpha-tocopherol
(capsules
containing
800
IU
daily
for
first
546
patients
400
IU
daily
for
remainder)
967
received
identical
placebo
capsules
The
primary
endpoints
were
a
combination
of
cardiovascular
death
and
non-fatal
MI
as
well
as
non-fatal
MI
alone
Plasma
alpha-tocopherol
concentrations
(measured
in
subsets
of
patients)
rose
in
the
actively
treated
group
(from
baseline
mean
342
micromol/L
to
511
micromol/L
with
400
IU
daily
and
645
micromol/L
with
800
IU
daily)
but
did
not
change
in
the
placebo
group
Alpha-tocopherol
treatment
significantly
reduced
the
risk
of
the
primary
trial
endpoint
of
cardiovascular
death
and
non-fatal
MI
(41
vs
64
events
relative
risk
053
[95%
Cl
034-083
p=0005)
The
beneficial
effects
on
this
composite
endpoint
were
due
to
a
significant
reduction
in
the
risk
of
non-fatal
MI
(14
vs
41
023
[011-047]
p=0005)
however
there
was
a
non-significant
excess
of
cardiovascular
deaths
in
the
alpha-tocopherol
group
(27
vs
23
118
[062-227]
p=061)
All-cause
mortality
was
36
of
1035
alpha-tocopherol-treated
patients
and
27
of
967
placebo
recipients
We
conclude
that
in
patients
with
angiographically
proven
symptomatic
coronary
atherosclerosis
alpha-tocopherol
treatment
substantially
reduces
the
rate
of
non-fatal
MI
with
beneficial
effects
apparent
after
1
year
of
treatment
The
effect
of
alpha-tocopherol
treatment
on
cardiovascular
deaths
requires
further
study
