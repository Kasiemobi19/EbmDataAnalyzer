Comparison
of
cryotherapy
and
curettage
for
the
treatment
of
pyogenic
granuloma
a
randomized
trial
Abstract
Text
Pyogenic
granuloma
is
a
benign
vascular
lesion
of
the
skin
and
mucous
membranes
Many
different
treatments
have
been
used
with
variable
success
rates
To
evaluate
and
compare
the
effects
of
cryotherapy
and
curettage
in
the
treatment
of
pyogenic
granuloma
Eighty-nine
patients
with
pyogenic
granuloma
were
randomized
to
receive
cryotherapy
with
liquid
nitrogen
or
curettage
and
electrodesiccation
Forty
patients
in
the
cryotherapy
group
and
36
patients
in
the
curettage
group
completed
the
study
period
Among
the
patients
who
completed
the
study
treatment
resulted
in
complete
resolution
of
all
lesions
after
one
to
three
sessions
(mean
142)
in
the
cryotherapy
group
and
after
one
to
two
sessions
(mean
103)
in
the
curettage
group
The
difference
between
the
two
groups
was
statistically
significant
(P
<
0001)
Twenty-three
patients
(575%)
in
the
cryotherapy
group
and
25
patients
(69%)
in
the
curettage
group
had
no
scar
or
pigmentation
abnormality
Except
for
cosmetic
problems
no
other
side-effect
or
complication
was
recorded
in
the
study
This
study
showed
that
both
cryotherapy
and
curettage
are
safe
and
effective
Curettage
had
the
advantage
of
fewer
treatment
sessions
required
to
achieve
resolution
and
better
cosmetic
results
We
suggest
that
curettage
could
be
the
first-line
treatment
for
pyogenic
granuloma
