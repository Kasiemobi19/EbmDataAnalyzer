Abstract
Text
Empirical
scores
computerized
ST-segment
measurements
and
equations
have
been
proposed
as
tools
for
improving
the
diagnostic
performance
of
the
exercise
test
To
compare
the
diagnostic
utility
of
these
scores
measurements
and
equations
with
that
of
visual
ST-segment
measurements
in
patients
with
reduced
workup
bias
Prospective
analysis
12
university-affiliated
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Centers
814
consecutive
patients
who
presented
with
angina
pectoris
and
agreed
to
undergo
both
exercise
testing
and
coronary
angiography
Digital
electrocardiographic
recorders
and
angiographic
calipers
were
used
for
testing
at
each
site
and
test
results
were
sent
to
core
laboratories
Although
25%
of
patients
had
previously
had
testing
workup
bias
was
reduced
as
shown
by
comparison
with
a
pilot
study
group
This
reduction
resulted
in
a
sensitivity
of
45%
and
a
specificity
of
85%
for
visual
analysis
Computerized
measurements
and
visual
analysis
had
similar
diagnostic
power
Equations
incorporating
nonelectrocardiographic
variables
and
either
visual
or
computerized
ST-segment
measurement
had
similar
discrimination
and
were
superior
to
single
ST-segment
measurements
These
equations
correctly
classified
5
more
patients
of
every
100
tested
(areas
under
the
receiver-operating
characteristic
curve
080
for
equations
and
068
for
visual
analysis
P
<
0001)
in
this
population
with
a
50%
prevalence
of
disease
Standard
exercise
tests
had
lower
sensitivity
but
higher
specificity
in
this
population
with
reduced
work-up
bias
than
in
previous
studies
Computerized
ST-segment
measurements
were
similar
to
visual
ST-segment
measurements
made
by
cardiologists
Considering
more
than
ST-segment
measurements
can
enhance
the
diagnostic
power
of
the
exercise
test
