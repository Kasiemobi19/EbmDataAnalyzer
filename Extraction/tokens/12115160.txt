Title
Psychological
interventions
for
rheumatoid
arthritis
a
meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
Abstract
Text
To
carry
out
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
examining
the
efficacy
of
psychological
interventions
(eg
relaxation
biofeedback
cognitive-behavioral
therapy)
in
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
(RA)
Studies
that
met
the
following
criteria
were
included
random
assignment
wait-list
or
usual
care
control
condition
publication
in
peer-reviewed
journals
treatment
that
included
some
psychological
component
beyond
simply
providing
education
information
and
separate
data
provided
for
patients
with
RA
if
subjects
with
conditions
other
than
RA
were
included
Two
investigators
independently
extracted
data
on
study
design
sample
size
and
characteristics
type
of
intervention
type
of
control
direction
and
nature
of
the
outcome(s)
Twenty-five
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Methodologic
quality
was
assessed
and
effect
sizes
were
calculated
for
6
outcomes
Significant
pooled
effect
sizes
were
found
postintervention
for
pain
(022)
functional
disability
(027)
psychological
status
(015)
coping
(046)
and
self
efficacy
(035)
At
followup
(averaging
85
months)
significant
pooled
effect
sizes
were
observed
for
tender
joints
(033)
psychological
status
(030)
and
coping
(052)
No
clear
or
consistent
patterns
emerged
when
effect
sizes
for
different
types
of
treatment
and
control
conditions
were
compared
or
when
higher
quality
trials
were
compared
to
lower
quality
ones
Findings
do
however
suggest
that
these
psychological
interventions
may
be
more
effective
for
patients
who
have
had
the
illness
for
shorter
duration
Despite
some
methodologic
flaws
in
the
literature
psychological
interventions
may
be
important
adjunctive
therapies
in
the
medical
management
of
RA
