Serum
TSH
T(4)
and
thyroid
antibodies
in
the
United
States
population
(1988
to
1994)
National

Examination
Survey

Abstract
Text
NHANES
III
measured
serum
TSH
total
serum
T(4)
antithyroperoxidase
(TPOAb)
and
antithyroglobulin
(TgAb)
antibodies
from
a
sample
of
17353
people
aged
>
or
=12
yr
representing
the
geographic
and
ethnic
distribution
of
the
US
population
These
data
provide
a
reference
for
other
studies
of
these
analytes
in
the
US
For
the
16533
people
who
did
not
report
thyroid
disease
goiter
or
taking
thyroid
medications
(disease-free
population)
we
determined
mean
concentrations
of
TSH
T(4)
TgAb
and
TPOAb
A
reference
population
of
13344
people
was
selected
from
the
disease-free
population
by
excluding
in
addition
those
who
were
pregnant
taking
androgens
or
estrogens
who
had
thyroid
antibodies
or
biochemical
hypothyroidism
or
hyperthyroidism
The
influence
of
demographics
on
TSH
T(4)
and
antibodies
was
examined
Hypothyroidism
was
found
in
46%
of
the
US
population
(03%
clinical
and
43%
subclinical)
and
hyperthyroidism
in
13%
(05%
clinical
and
07%
subclinical)
(Subclinical
hypothyroidism
is
used
in
this
paper
to
mean
mild
hypothyroidism
the
term
now
preferred
by
the
American
Thyroid
Association
for
the
laboratory
findings
described)
For
the
disease-free
population
mean
serum
TSH
was
150
(95%
confidence
interval
146-154)
mIU/liter
was
higher
in
females
than
males
and
higher
in
white
non-Hispanics
(whites)
[157
(152-162)
mIU/liter]
than
black
non-Hispanics
(blacks)
[118
(114-121)
mIU/liter]
(P
<
0001)
or
Mexican
Americans
[143
(140-146)
mIU/liter]
(P
<
0001)
TgAb
were
positive
in
104
+/-
05%
and
TPOAb
in
113
+/-
04%
positive
antibodies
were
more
prevalent
in
women
than
men
increased
with
age
and
TPOAb
were
less
prevalent
in
blacks
(45
+/-
03%)
than
in
whites
(123
+/-
05%)
(P
<
0001)
TPOAb
were
significantly
associated
with
hypo
or
hyperthyroidism
but
TgAb
were
not
Using
the
reference
population
geometric
mean
TSH
was
140
+/-
002
mIU/liter
and
increased
with
age
and
was
significantly
lower
in
blacks
(118
+/-
002
mIU/liter)
than
whites
(145
+/-
002
mIU/liter)
(P
<
0001)
and
Mexican
Americans
(137
+/-
002
mIU/liter)
(P
<
0001)
Arithmetic
mean
total
T(4)
was
1123
+/-
07
nmol/liter
in
the
disease-free
population
and
was
consistently
higher
among
Mexican
Americans
in
all
populations
In
the
reference
population
mean
total
T(4)
in
Mexican
Americans
was
(1163
+/-
07
nmol/liter)
significantly
higher
than
whites
(1100
+/-
08
nmol/liter)
or
blacks
(1094
+/-
08
nmol/liter)
(P
<
00001)
The
difference
persisted
in
all
age
groups
In
summary
TSH
and
the
prevalence
of
antithyroid
antibodies
are
greater
in
females
increase
with
age
and
are
greater
in
whites
and
Mexican
Americans
than
in
blacks
TgAb
alone
in
the
absence
of
TPOAb
is
not
significantly
associated
with
thyroid
disease
The
lower
prevalence
of
thyroid
antibodies
and
lower
TSH
concentrations
in
blacks
need
more
research
to
relate
these
findings
to
clinical
status
A
large
proportion
of
the
US
population
unknowingly
have
laboratory
evidence
of
thyroid
disease
which
supports
the
usefulness
of
screening
for
early
detection
