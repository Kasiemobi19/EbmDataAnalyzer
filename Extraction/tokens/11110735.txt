Abstract
Text
To
assess
and
compare
the
effects
of
candesartan
or
lisinopril
or
both
on
blood
pressure
and
urinary
albumin
excretion
in
patients
with
microalbuminuria
hypertension
and
type
2
diabetes
Prospective
randomised
parallel
group
double
blind
study
with
four
week
placebo
run
in
period
and
12
weeks'
monotherapy
with
candesartan
or
lisinopril
followed
by
12
weeks'
monotherapy
or
combination
treatment
Tertiary
hospitals
and
primary
care
centres
in
four
countries
(37
centres)
199
patients
aged
30-75
years
Candesartan
16
mg
once
daily
lisinopril
20
mg
once
daily
Blood
pressure
and
urinary
albumincreatinine
ratio
At
12
weeks
mean
(95%
confidence
interval)
reductions
in
diastolic
blood
pressure
were
95
mm
Hg
(77
mm
Hg
to
112
mm
Hg
P<0001)
and
97
mm
Hg
(79
mm
Hg
to
115
mm
Hg
P<0001)
respectively
and
in
urinary
albumincreatinine
ratio
were
30%
(15%
to
42%
P<0001)
and
46%
(35%
to
56%
P<0001)
for
candesartan
and
lisinopril
respectively
At
24
weeks
the
mean
reduction
in
diastolic
blood
pressure
with
combination
treatment
(163
mm
Hg
136
mm
Hg
to
189
mm
Hg
P<0
001)
was
significantly
greater
than
that
with
candesartan
(104
mm
Hg
77
mm
Hg
to
131
mm
Hg
P<0001)
or
lisinopril
(mean
107
mm
Hg
80
mm
Hg
to
135
mm
Hg
P<0001)
Furthermore
the
reduction
in
urinary
albumincreatinine
ratio
with
combination
treatment
(50%
36%
to
61%
P<0001)
was
greater
than
with
candesartan
(24%
0%
to
43%
P=005)
and
lisinopril
(39%
20%
to
54%
P<0001)
All
treatments
were
generally
well
tolerated
Candesartan
16
mg
once
daily
is
as
effective
as
lisinopril
20
mg
once
daily
in
reducing
blood
pressure
and
microalbuminuria
in
hypertensive
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
Combination
treatment
is
well
tolerated
and
more
effective
in
reducing
blood
pressure
