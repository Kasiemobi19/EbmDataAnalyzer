Non-invasive
physical
treatments
for
chronic/recurrent
headache
Abstract
Text
Non-invasive
physical
treatments
are
often
used
to
treat
common
types
of
chronic/recurrent
headache
To
quantify
and
compare
the
magnitude
of
short-
and
long-term
effects
of
non-invasive
physical
treatments
for
chronic/recurrent
headaches
We
searched
the
following
databases
from
their
inception
to
November
2002
MEDLINE
EMBASE
BIOSIS
CINAHL

CENTRAL
and
the
Specialised
Register
of
the
Cochrane
Pain
Palliative
Care
and
Supportive
Care
review
group
Selected
complementary
medicine
reference
systems
were
searched
as
well
We
also
performed
citation
tracking
and
hand
searching
of
potentially
relevant
journals
We
included
randomized
and
quasi-randomized
controlled
trials
comparing
non-invasive
physical
treatments
for
chronic/recurrent
headaches
to
any
type
of
control
Two
independent
reviewers
abstracted
trial
information
and
scored
trials
for
methodological
quality
Outcomes
data
were
standardized
into
percentage
point
and
effect
size
scores
wherever
possible
The
strength
of
the
evidence
of
effectiveness
was
assessed
using
pre-specified
rules
Twenty-two
studies
with
a
total
of
2628
patients
(age
12
to
78
years)
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Five
types
of
headache
were
studied
migraine
tension-type
cervicogenic
a
mix
of
migraine
and
tension-type
and
post-traumatic
headache
Ten
studies
had
methodological
quality
scores
of
50
or
more
(out
of
a
possible
100
points)
but
many
limitations
were
identified
We
were
unable
to
pool
data
because
of
study
heterogeneity
For
the
prophylactic
treatment
of
migraine
headache
there
is
evidence
that
spinal
manipulation
may
be
an
effective
treatment
option
with
a
short-term
effect
similar
to
that
of
a
commonly
used
effective
drug
(amitriptyline)
Other
possible
treatment
options
with
weaker
evidence
of
effectiveness
are
pulsating
electromagnetic
fields
and
a
combination
of
transcutaneous
electrical
nerve
stimulation
[TENS]
and
electrical
neurotransmitter
modulation
For
the
prophylactic
treatment
of
chronic
tension-type
headache
amitriptyline
is
more
effective
than
spinal
manipulation
during
treatment
However
spinal
manipulation
is
superior
in
the
short
term
after
cessation
of
both
treatments
Other
possible
treatment
options
with
weaker
evidence
of
effectiveness
are
therapeutic
touch
cranial
electrotherapy
a
combination
of
TENS
and
electrical
neurotransmitter
modulation
and
a
regimen
of
auto-massage
TENS
and
stretching
For
episodic
tension-type
headache
there
is
evidence
that
adding
spinal
manipulation
to
massage
is
not
effective
For
the
prophylactic
treatment
of
cervicogenic
headache
there
is
evidence
that
both
neck
exercise
(low-intensity
endurance
training)
and
spinal
manipulation
are
effective
in
the
short
and
long
term
when
compared
to
no
treatment
There
is
also
evidence
that
spinal
manipulation
is
effective
in
the
short
term
when
compared
to
massage
or
placebo
spinal
manipulation
and
weaker
evidence
when
compared
to
spinal
mobilization
There
is
weaker
evidence
that
spinal
mobilization
is
more
effective
in
the
short
term
than
cold
packs
in
the
treatment
of
post-traumatic
headache
A
few
non-invasive
physical
treatments
may
be
effective
as
prophylactic
treatments
for
chronic/recurrent
headaches
Based
on
trial
results
these
treatments
appear
to
be
associated
with
little
risk
of
serious
adverse
effects
The
clinical
effectiveness
and
cost-effectiveness
of
non-invasive
physical
treatments
require
further
research
using
scientifically
rigorous
methods
The
heterogeneity
of
the
studies
included
in
this
review
means
that
the
results
of
a
few
additional
high-quality
trials
in
the
future
could
easily
change
the
conclusions
of
our
review
