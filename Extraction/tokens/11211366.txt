Impairment
and
deportment
responses
to
different
methylphenidate
doses
in
children
with
ADHD
the
MTA
titration
trial
Abstract
Text
Results
of
the
NIMH
Collaborative
Multisite
Multimodal
Treatment
Study
of
Children
With
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder
(MTA)
were
analyzed
to
determine
whether
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
methylphenidate
(MPH)
titration
trial
identified
the
best
MPH
dose
for
each
child
with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
Children
with
ADHD
assigned
to
MTA
medication
treatment
groups
(n
=
289)
underwent
a
controlled
28-day
titration
protocol
that
administered
different
MPH
doses
(placebo
low
middle
and
high)
on
successive
days
A
repeated-measures
analysis
of
variance
revealed
main
effects
for
MPH
dose
with
greater
effects
on
teacher
ratings
of
impairment
and
deportment
(F3

than
on
parent
ratings
of
similar
endpoints

The
MTA
titration
protocol
validated
the
efficacy
of
weekend
MPH
dosing
and
established
a
total
daily
dose
limit
of
35
mg
of
MPH
for
children
weighing
less
than
25
kg
It
replicated
previously
reported

(77%)

of

mg/day)
