in

Abstract
Text
Acute
uncomplicated
urinary
tract
infection
is
a
common
and
costly
disorder
in
women
To
reduce
potentially
unnecessary
expense
and
inconvenience
a
large
staff-model
health
maintenance
organization
instituted
a
telephone-based
clinical
practice
guideline
for
managing
presumed
cystitis
in
which
women
18
to
55
years
of
age
who
met
specific
criteria
were
managed
without
a
clinic
visit
or
laboratory
testing
We
sought
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
the
guideline
We
performed
a
population-based
before-and-after
study
with
concurrent
control
groups
at
24
primary
care
clinics
to
assess
the
effect
of
guideline
implementation
on
resource
utilization
and
on
the
occurrence
of
potential
adverse
outcomes
We
measured
the
proportion
of
patients
with
presumed
uncomplicated
cystitis
who
had
a
return
office
visit
for
cystitis
or
sexually
transmitted
disease
or
who
developed
pyelonephritis
within
60
days
of
the
initial
diagnosis
Relative
risks
(RR)
and
95%
confidence
intervals
(CI)
were
estimated
adjusting
for
the
effects
of
clustering
within
clinics
A
total
of
3889
eligible
patients
with
presumed
acute
uncomplicated
cystitis
were
evaluated
As
compared
with
baseline
guideline
implementation
significantly
decreased
the
proportion
of
patients
with
presumed
cystitis
who
received
urinalysis
(RR
=
075
CI
070
to
080)
urine
culture
(RR
=
073
CI
068
to
079)
and
an
initial
office
visit
(RR
=
067
CI
062
to
073)
while
increasing
the
proportion
who
received
a
guideline-recommended
antibiotic
29-fold
(CI
24
to
37-fold)
In
the
prospective
comparison
of
the
22
intervention
and
two
control
clinics
the
guideline
decreased
the
proportion
of
patients
who
had
urinalyses
performed
(RR
=
080
CI
065
to
098)
and
increased
the
proportion
of
patients
who
were
prescribed
a
guideline-recommended
antibiotic
(RR
=
153
CI
101
to
233)
Adverse
outcomes
did
not
increase
significantly
in
either
comparison
Guideline
use
decreased
laboratory
utilization
and
overall
costs
while
maintaining
or
improving
the
quality
of
care
for
patients
who
were
presumptively
treated
for
acute
uncomplicated
cystitis
