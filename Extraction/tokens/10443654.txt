Title
Effect
of
testosterone
treatment
on
body
composition
and
muscle
strength
in
men
over
65
years
of
age
Abstract
Text
As
men
age
serum
testosterone
concentrations
decrease
the
percentage
of
body
mass
that
is
fat
increases
the
percentage
of
lean
body
mass
decreases
and
muscle
strength
decreases
Because
these
changes
are
similar
to
those
that
occur
in
hypogonadal
men
we
hypothesized
that
increasing
the
serum
testosterone
concentration
of
men
over
65
yr
of
age
to
that
in
young
men
would
decrease
their
fat
mass
increase
their
lean
mass
and
increase
their
muscle
strength
We
randomized
108
men
over
65
yr
of
age
to
wear
either
a
testosterone
patch
or
a
placebo
patch
in
a
double
blind
study
for
36
months
We
measured
body
composition
by
dual
energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
and
muscle
strength
by
dynamometer
before
and
during
treatment
Ninety-six
men
completed
the
entire
36-month
protocol
Fat
mass
decreased
(-30+/-05
kg)
in
the
testosterone-treated
men
during
the
36
months
of
treatment
which
was
significantly
different
(P
=
0001)
from
the
decrease
(-07+/-05
kg)
in
the
placebo-treated
men
Lean
mass
increased
(19+/-03
kg)
in
the
testosterone-treated
men
which
was
significantly
different
(P
<
0001)
from
that
(02+/-02
kg)
in
the
placebo-treated
men
The
decrease
in
fat
mass
in
the
testosterone-treated
men
was
principally
in
the
arms
(-07+/-01
kg
P
<
0001
compared
to
the
placebo
group)
and
legs
(-11+/-02
kg
P
<
0001)
and
the
increase
in
lean
mass
was
principally
in
the
trunk
(19+/-03
kg
P
<
0001)
The
change
in
strength
of
knee
extension
and
flexion
at
60
degrees
and
180
degrees
angular
velocity
during
treatment
however
was
not
significantly
different
between
the
two
groups
We
conclude
that
increasing
the
serum
testosterone
concentrations
of
normal
men
over
65
yr
of
age
to
the
midnormal
range
for
young
men
decreased
fat
mass
principally
in
the
arms
and
legs
and
increased
lean
mass
principally
in
the
trunk
but
did
not
increase
the
strength
of
knee
extension
and
flexion
as
measured
by
dynamometer
