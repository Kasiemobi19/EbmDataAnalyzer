Abstract

To
document
changes
in
the
prevalence
of
resistance
of
Propionibacterium
acnes
to
antibiotics
used
for
treating
acne
MEDLINE
and
EMBASE
were
searched
for
publications
on
P
acnes
resistance
to
systemic
antibiotics
The
search
strategy
mapped
"acne"
or
"acne
vulgaris"
with
the
terms
"antibiotic
resistance"
or
"drug
resistance
microbial"
Only
papers
published
in
English
during
1976
to
1997
were
included
in
the
search
53
publications
met
the
search
criteria
The
search
output
was
refined
by
selecting
papers
that
specifically
addressed
P
acnes
resistance
patterns
Additional
studies
(not
included
in
the
search
output)
were
identified
from
review
articles
and
references
of
the
retrieved
articles
Twelve
articles
were
reviewed
Data
on
the
prevalence
of
antibiotic-resistant
propionibacteria
the
incidence
of
individual
resistance
phenotypes
mixed
resistance
and
correlation
between
poor
therapeutic
response
and
resistant
propionibacteria
were
extracted
Research
since
1978
has
suggested
an
association
between
poor
therapeutic
response
and
antibiotic-resistant
propionibacteria
The
overall
incidence
of
P
acnes
antibiotic
resistance
has
increased
from
20%
in
1978
to
62%
in
1996
Resistance
to
specific
antibiotics
varied
and
was
most
commonly
reported
with
erythromycin
and
clindamycin
tetracycline
and
doxcycline
and
trimethoprim
Resistance
to
minocycline
is
rare
In
many
patients
with
acne
continued
treatment
with
antibiotics
can
be
inappropriate
or
ineffective
It
is
important
to
recognise
therapeutic
failure
and
alter
treatment
accordingly
The
use
of
long-term
rotational
antibiotics
is
outdated
and
will
only
exacerbate
antibiotic
resistance
