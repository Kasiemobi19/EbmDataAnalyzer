Intra-articular
hyaluronic
acid
for
the
treatment
of
osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Osteoarthritis
of
the
knee
affects
up
to
10%
of
the
elderly
population
The
condition
is
frequently
treated
by
intra-articular
injection
of
hyaluronic
acid
We
performed
a
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
this
treatment
We
searched
MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
BIOSIS
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trial
Register
from
inception
until
April
2004
using
a
combination
of
search
terms
for
knee
osteoarthritis
and
hyaluronic
acid
and
a
filter
for
randomized
controlled
trials
We
extracted
data
on
pain
at
rest
pain
during
or
immediately
after
movement
joint
function
and
adverse
events
Twenty-two
trials
that
reported
usable
quantitative
information
on
any
of
the
predefined
end
points
were
identified
and
included
in
the
systematic
review
Even
though
pain
at
rest
may
be
improved
by
hyaluronic
acid
the
data
available
from
these
studies
did
not
allow
an
appropriate
assessment
of
this
end
point
Patients
who
received
the
intervention
experienced
a
reduction
in
pain
during
movement
the
mean
difference
on
a
100-mm
visual
analogue
scale
was
-38
mm
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
-91
to
14
mm)
after
2-6
weeks
-43
mm
(95%
CI
-76
to
-09
mm)
after
10-14
weeks
and
-71
mm
(95%
CI
-118
to
-24
mm)
after
22-30
weeks
However
this
effect
was
not
compatible
with
a
clinically
meaningful
difference
(expected
to
be
about
15
mm
on
the
visual
analogue
scale)
Furthermore
the
effect
was
exaggerated
by
trials
not
reporting
an
intention-to-treat
analysis
No
improvement
in
knee
function
was
observed
at
any
time
point
Even
so
the
effect
of
hyaluronic
acid
on
knee
function
was
more
favourable
when
allocation
was
not
concealed
Adverse
events
occurred
slightly
more
often
among
patients
who
received
the
intervention
(relative
risk
108
95%
CI
101
to
115)
Only
4
trials
explicitly
reported
allocation
concealment
had
blinded
outcome
assessment
and
presented
intention-to-treat
data
According
to
the
currently
available
evidence
intra-articular
hyaluronic
acid
has
not
been
proven
clinically
effective
and
may
be
associated
with
a
greater
risk
of
adverse
events
Large
trials
with
clinically
relevant
and
uniform
end
points
are
necessary
to
clarify
the
benefit-risk
ratio
