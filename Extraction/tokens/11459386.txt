Long-term
outcome
of
panic
disorder
with
agoraphobia
treated
by
exposure
Abstract
Text
There
is
a
paucity
of
long-term
outcome
studies
of
panic
disorder
that
exceed
a
2-year
follow-up
The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
evaluate
the
long-term
follow-up
of
patients
with
panic
disorder
with
agoraphobia
treated
according
to
a
standardized
protocol
A
consecutive
series
of
200
patients
satisfying
the
DSM-IV
criteria
for
panic
disorder
with
agoraphobia
was
treated
in
an
out-patient
clinic
with
behavioural
methods
based
on
exposure
homework
One
hundred
and
thirty-six
patients
became
panic
free
after
12
sessions
of
psychotherapy
and
132
were
available
for
follow-up
A
2-
to
14-year
(median
=
8
years)
follow-up
was
performed
Survival
analysis
was
employed
to
characterize
the
clinical
course
of
patients
Thirty-one
of
the
132
patients
(23%)
had
a
relapse
of
panic
disorder
at
some
time
during
follow-up
The
estimated
cumulative
percentage
of
patients
remaining
in
remission
was
931
after
2
years
824
after
5
years
788
after
7
years
and
621
after
10
years
Such
probabilities
increased
with
younger
age
and
in
the
absence
of
a
personality
disorder
of
high
pre-treatment
levels
of
depressed
mood
of
residual
agoraphobic
avoidance
after
exposure
and
of
concurrent
use
of
benzodiazepines
and
antidepressant
drugs
The
findings
suggest
that
exposure
treatment
can
provide
lasting
relief
to
the
majority
of
patients
with
panic
disorder
and
agoraphobia
Disappearance
of
residual
and
subclinical
agoraphobic
avoidance
and
not
simply
of
panic
attacks
should
be
the
aim
of
exposure
therapy
