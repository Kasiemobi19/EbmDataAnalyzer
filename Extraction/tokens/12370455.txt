Opioids
versus
antidepressants
in
postherpetic
neuralgia
a
randomized
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Tricyclic
antidepressants
(TCA)
provide
less
than
satisfactory
pain
relief
for
postherpetic
neuralgia
(PHN)
and
the
role
of
opioids
is
controversial
To
compare
the
analgesic
and
cognitive
effects
of
opioids
with
those
of
TCA
and
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
PHN
Seventy-six
patients
with
PHN
were
randomized
in
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
crossover
trial
Each
subject
was
scheduled
to
undergo
three
treatment
periods
(opioid
TCA
and
placebo)
approximately
8
weeks'
duration
each
Doses
were
titrated
to
maximal
relief
or
intolerable
side
effects
The
primary
outcome
measures
were
pain
intensity
(0
to
10
scale)
pain
relief
(0
to
100%)
and
cognitive
function
Analyses
included
patients
who
provided
any
pain
ratings
after
having
received
at
least
a
single
dose
of
a
study
medication
Fifty
patients
completed
two
periods
and
44
patients
completed
all
three
Mean
daily
maintenance
doses
were
morphine
91
mg
or
methadone
15
mg
and
nortriptyline
89
mg
or
desipramine
63
mg
Opioids
and
TCA
reduced
pain
(19
and
14)
more
than
placebo
(02
p
<
0001)
with
no
appreciable
effect
on
any
cognitive
measure
The
trend
favoring
opioids
over
TCA
fell
short
of
significance
(p
=
006)
and
reduction
in
pain
with
opioids
did
not
correlate
with
that
following
TCA
Treatment
with
opioids
and
TCA
resulted
in
greater
pain
relief
(38
and
32%)
compared
with
placebo
(11%
p
<
0001)
More
patients
completing
all
three
treatments
preferred
opioids
(54%)
than
TCA
(30%
p
=
002)
Opioids
effectively
treat
PHN
without
impairing
cognition
Opioids
and
TCA
act
via
independent
mechanisms
and
with
varied
individual
effect
