hip-surgery

risk

delirium
a
randomized
placebo-controlled
study
Abstract
Text
To
study
the
effectiveness
of
haloperidol
prophylaxis
on
incidence
severity
and
duration
of
postoperative
delirium
in
elderly
hip-surgery
patients
at
risk
for
delirium
Randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Large
medical
school-affiliated
general
hospital
in
Alkmaar
The
Netherlands
A
total
of
430
hip-surgery
patients
aged
70
and
older
at
risk
for
postoperative
delirium
Haloperidol
15
mg/d
or
placebo
was
started
preoperatively
and
continued
for
up
to
3
days
postoperatively
Proactive
geriatric
consultation
was
provided
for
all
randomized
patients
The
primary
outcome
was
the
incidence
of
postoperative
delirium
(Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manual
of
Mental
Disorders

Edition
and
Confusion

Method
criteria)
Secondary
outcomes
were
the
severity
of
delirium
(Delirium
Rating
Scale
revised
version-98
(DRS-R-98))
the
duration
of
delirium
and
the
length
of
hospital
stay
The
overall
incidence
of
postoperative
delirium
was
158%
The
percentage
of
patients
with
postoperative
delirium
in
the
haloperidol
and
placebo
treatment
condition
was
151%
and
165%
respectively
(relative
risk=091
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)=06-13)
the
mean
highest
DRS-R-98
score+/-standard
deviation
was
144+/-34
and
184+/-43
respectively
(mean
difference

CI=20-58
P<001)
delirium
duration
was
54
versus
118
days
respectively
(mean
difference
64
days
95%
CI=40-80
P<001)
and
the
mean
number
of
days
in
the
hospital
was
171+/-111
and
226+/-167
respectively
(mean
difference
55
days
95%
CI=14-23
P<001)
No
haloperidol-related
side
effects
were
noted
Low-dose
haloperidol
prophylactic
treatment
demonstrated
no
efficacy
in
reducing
the
incidence
of
postoperative
delirium
It
did
have
a
positive
effect
on
the
severity
and
duration
of
delirium
Moreover
haloperidol
reduced
the
number
of
days
patients
stayed
in
the
hospital
and
the
therapy
was
well
tolerated
