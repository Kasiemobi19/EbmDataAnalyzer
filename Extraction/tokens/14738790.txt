Abstract
Text
After
striking
changes
in
rates
of
sudden
unexplained
infant
death
(SIDS)
around
1990
four
large
case-control
studies
were
set
up
to
re-examine
the
epidemiology
of
this
syndrome
The
European
Concerted
Action
on
SIDS
(ECAS)
investigation
was
planned
to
bring
together
data
from
these
and
new
studies
to
give
an
overview
of
risk
factors
for
the
syndrome
in
Europe
We
undertook
case-control
studies
in
20
regions
Data
for
more
than
60
variables
were
extracted
from
anonymised
records
of
745
SIDS
cases
and
2411
live
controls
Logistic
regression
was
used
to
calculate
odds
ratios
(ORs)
for
every
factor
in
isolation
and
to
construct
multivariate
models
Principal
risk
factors
were
largely
independent
Multivariately
significant
ORs
showed
little
evidence
of
intercentre
heterogeneity
apart
from
four
outliers
which
were
eliminated
Highly
significant
risks
were
associated
with
prone
sleeping
(OR
131
[95%
CI
851-202])
and
with
turning
from
the
side
to
the
prone
position
(454
[234-879])
About
48%
of
cases
were
attributable
to
sleeping
in
the
side
or
prone
position
If
the
mother
smoked
significant
risks
were
associated
with
bed-sharing
especially
during
the
first
weeks
of
life
(at
2
weeks
270
[133-549])
This
OR
was
partly
attributable
to
mother's
consumption
of
alcohol
Mother's
alcohol
consumption
was
significant
only
when
baby
bed-shared
all
night
(OR
increased
by
166
[116-238]
per
drink)
For
mothers
who
did
not
smoke
during
pregnancy
OR
for
bed-sharing
was
very
small
(at
2
weeks
24
[12-46])
and
only
significant
during
the
first
8
weeks
of
life
About
16%
of
cases
were
attributable
to
bed-sharing
and
roughly
36%
to
the
baby
sleeping
in
a
separate
room
Avoidable
risk
factors
such
as
those
associated
with
inappropriate
infants'
sleeping
position
type
of
bedding
used
and
sleeping
arrangements
strongly
suggest
a
basis
for
further
substantial
reductions
in
SIDS
incidence
rates
