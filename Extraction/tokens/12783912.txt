Effects
of
rofecoxib
or
naproxen
vs
placebo
on
Alzheimer
disease
progression
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Laboratory
evidence
that
inflammatory
mechanisms
contribute
to
neuronal
injury
in
Alzheimer
disease
(AD)
along
with
epidemiological
evidence
suggests
that
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
may
favorably
influence
the
course
of
the
disease
To
determine
whether
treatment
with
a
selective
cyclooxygenase
(COX)
-2
inhibitor
(rofecoxib)
or
a
traditional
nonselective
NSAID
(naproxen)
slows
cognitive
decline
in
patients
with
mild-to-moderate
AD
Multicenter
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
parallel
group
trial
with
1-year
exposure
to
study
medications
Forty
ambulatory
treatment
centers
affiliated
with
the
Alzheimer's
Disease
Cooperative
Study
consortium
Participants
with
mild-to-moderate
AD
(Mini-Mental
State
Examination
score
of
13-26)
were
recruited
from
December
1999
to
November
2000
using
clinic
populations
referrals
from
community
physicians
and
local
advertising
Stable
use
of
cholinesterase
inhibitors
estrogen
low-dose
aspirin
and
vitamin
E
was
allowed
Participants
with
inflammatory
diseases
that
might
respond
to
the
study
medications
were
excluded
Of
474
participants
screened
351
were
enrolled
Once-daily
rofecoxib
25
mg
or
twice-daily
naproxen
sodium
220
mg
or
placebo
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
the
1-year
change
in
the
Alzheimer
Disease
Assessment
Scale-Cognitive
(ADAS-Cog)
subscale
score
Secondary
outcome
measures
included
the
Clinical
Dementia
Rating
scale
sum-of-boxes
the
Neuropsychiatric
Inventory
the
Quality
of
Life-AD
and
the
time
to
attainment
of
significant
end
points
(4-point
decline
from
baseline
ADAS-Cog
score
1-step

on
the
global
Clinical

Rating
scale
15-point

or
death)
The
1-year
mean
(SD)
change
in
ADAS-Cog
scores
in
participants
treated
with
naproxen
(58
[80])
or
rofecoxib
(76
[77])
was
not
significantly
different
from
the
change
in
participants
treated
with
placebo
(57
[82])
Results
of
secondary
analyses
showed
no
consistent
benefit
of
either
treatment
Fatigue
dizziness
and
hypertension
were
more
commonly
reported
in
the
active
drug
groups
and
more
serious
adverse
events
were
found
in
the
active
treatment
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
The
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
rofecoxib
or
low-dose
naproxen
does
not
slow
cognitive
decline
in
patients
with
mild-to-moderate
AD
