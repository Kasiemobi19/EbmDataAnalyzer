Prediction
of
all-cause
and
cardiovascular
mortality
in
elderly

low

cohort
study
Abstract
Text
Low
serum
thyrotropin
in
combination
with
normal
concentrations
of
circulating
thyroid
hormones
is
common
especially
in
elderly
people
and
in
individuals
with
a
history
of
thyroid
disease
We
aimed
to
assess
the
long-term
effects
of
subclinical
hyperthyroidism
on
mortality
We
did
a
population-based
study
of
mortality
in
a
cohort
of
1191
individuals
not
on
thyroxine
or
antithyroid
medication
All
participants
were
aged
60
years
or
older
We
measured
concentration
of
thyrotropin
in
serum
at
baseline
in
1988-89
We
recorded
vital
status
on
June
1
1999
and
ascertained
causes
of
death
for
those
who
had
died
We
compared
data
for
causes
of
death
with
age-specific
sex-specific
and
year-specific
data
for
England
and
Wales
We
also
compared
mortality
within
the
cohort
according
to
initial
thyrotropin
measurement
During
9733
person-years
of
follow-up
509
of
1191
people
died
the
expected
number
of
deaths
being
496
(standardised
mortality
ratio
[SMR]
10
95%
CI
09-11)
Mortality
from
all
causes
was
significantly
increased
at
2
(SMR
21)
3
(21)
4
(17)
and
5
(18)
years
after
first
measurement
in
those
with
low
serum
thyrotropin
(n471)
These
increases
were
largely
accounted
for
by
significant
increases
in
mortality
due
to
circulatory
diseases
(SMR
21
22
19
20
at
years
2
3
4
and
5
respectively)
Increases
in
mortality
from
all
causes
in
years
2-5
were
higher
in
patients
with
low
serum
thyrotropin
than
in
the
rest
of
the
cohort
(hazard
ratios
for
years
2
3
4
and
5
were
21
22
18
and
18
respectively)
This
result
reflects
an
increase
in
mortality
from
circulatory
diseases
(hazard
ratios
at
years
2
3
4
and
5
were
23
26

and
specifically
from
cardiovascular
diseases
(hazard
ratios
at
years
2

4
and
5
were
33

A
single
measurement
of
low
serum
thyrotropin
in
individuals
aged
60
years
or
older
is
associated
with
increased
mortality
from
all
causes
and
in
particular
mortality
due
to
circulatory
and
cardiovascular
diseases
