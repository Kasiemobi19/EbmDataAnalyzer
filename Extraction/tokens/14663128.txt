Diagnosis
of
pelvic

time
for
a
rethink
Abstract
Text
To
critically
evaluate
the
available
evidence
base
concerned
with
the
diagnosis
of
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(PID)
based
on
clinical
presentation
and
to
investigate
the
relation
between
signs
and
symptoms
and
the
presence
of
laparoscopically
diagnosed
PID
using
the
largest
available
dataset
The
evidence
base
was
critically
evaluated
and
data
collected
by
Lund
University
between
1960
and
1969
were
used
to
compare
clinical
presentation
with
the
results
of
laparoscopic
investigation
Three
techniques
were
used
in
this
investigation-sensitivity
and
specificity
likelihood
ratios
and
discriminant
analysis
None
of
the
variables
(abnormal
vaginal
discharge
fever
>38
degrees
C
vomiting
menstrual
irregularity
ongoing
bleeding
symptoms
of
urethritis
rectal
temperature
>38
degrees
C
marked
tenderness
of
pelvic
organs
on
bimanual
examination
adnexal
mass
and
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
>or=15
mm
in
the
first
hour)
had
both
high
specificity
and
sensitivity-most
had
low
specificity
and
sensitivity
There
was
little
variation
in
either
the
likelihood
ratios
or
the
post-test
probabilities
between
the
variables
The
lowest
likelihood
ratio
(097)
produced
a
post-test
probability
of
78%
(95%
CI
74%
to
81%)
whereas
the
highest
(173)
had
a
post-test
probability
of
84%
(95%
CI
81%
to
87%)
The
pretest
probability
of
having
PID
based
on
the
presence
of
lower
abdominal
pain
was
79%
(95%
CI
76%
to
82%)
The
discriminant
analysis
indicated
that
three
variables
significantly
influenced
the
prediction
of
the
presence
of
PID
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
(p<00001)
fever
(p<00001)
and
adnexal
tenderness
(p<00001)
These
variables
correctly
classified
65%
of
patients
with
laparoscopically
diagnosed
PID
(95%
CI
61%
to
69%)
There
is
insufficient
evidence
to
support
existing
diagnostic
criteria
which
have
been
based
on
a
combination
of
empirical
data
and
expert
opinion
A
new
evidence
base
is
urgently
needed
but
this
will
require
either
a
new
investigation
of
the
association
between
clinical
presentation
and
PID
based
on
a
laparoscopic
"gold
standard"
or
the
development
of
new
diagnostic
techniques
