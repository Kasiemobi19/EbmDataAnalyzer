Title
Treatment
of
childhood
encopresis
a
randomized
trial
comparing
three
treatment
protocols
Abstract
Text
To
compare
short-
and
long-term
effectiveness
of
three
additive
treatment
protocols
in
children
experiencing
chronic
encopresis
Children
6
to
15
years
of
age
who
experienced
at
least
weekly
fecal
soiling
for
6
months
or
longer
were
eligible
for
the
study
Children
were
randomly
assigned
to
a
group
that
received
intensive
medical
therapy
(IMT)
a
group
that
received
intensive
medical
therapy
plus
a
behavior
management
program
called
enhanced
toilet
training
(ETT)
or
a
group
that
received
intensive
medical
therapy
with
enhanced
toilet
training
and
external
anal
sphincter
electromyographic
biofeedback
(BF)
Data
concerning
toileting
habits
were
collected
for
14
consecutive
days
before
an
initial
visit
and
at
3
6
and
12
months
after
initiation
of
therapy
All
data
were
collected
using
a
computerized
voice-mail
system
that
telephoned
the
families
each
day
At
12
months
children
were
classified
as
significantly
improved
(reduction
in
soiling
P
<
0001)
or
cured
(<one
fecal
accident
in
2
weeks)
Eighty-seven
children
participated
in
the
study
72
boys
and
15
girls
Mean
age
at
enrollment
was
86
+/-
20
years
and
mean
duration
of
symptoms
was
582
+/-
385
months
At
12
months
the
cure
rates
for
the
IMM
ETT
and
BF
groups
were
36
48
and
39
respectively
(not
significant)
The
improvement
rates
for
these
three
groups
were
45
78
and
54
respectively
(P
<
005)
These
results
were
very
stable
over
time
(r
>
090
P
<
0001
in
each
case)
Response
to
treatment
during
the
first
2
weeks
of
therapy
was
highly
predictive
of
outcome
at
3
6
and
12
months
(P
<
00001)
Children
in
the
ETT
group
used
less
laxative
medication
(P
<
004)
and
required
fewer
treatment
contacts
(P
=
008)
than
children
in
the
IMM
group
All
three
treatments
resulted
in
significant
increases
in
daily
bowel
movements
passed
in
the
toilet
and
self-initiated
toileting
and
resulted
in
decreases
in
average
daily
soiling
at
3
6
and
12
months
(P
<
005)
Enhanced
toilet
training
is
somewhat
more
effective
in
treating
childhood
encopresis
than
either
intensive
medical
therapy
or
anal
sphincter
biofeedback
therapy
Although
similar
total
cure
rates
at
1
year
can
be
expected
with
these
three
forms
of
therapy
enhanced
toilet
training
results
in
statistically
significant
decreases
in
the
daily
frequency
of
soiling
for
the
greatest
number
of
children
