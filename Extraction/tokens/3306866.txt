Title
Effect
of
exercise
on
serum
enzyme
activities
in
humans
Abstract
Text
Increased
serum
enzyme
activity
after
exercise
was
first
reported
in
1958
subsequent
studies
have
established
that
many
factors
determine
the
degree
to
which
the
serum
activities
of
a
variety
of
enzymes
increase
during
and
after
exercise
The
serum
activities
of
those
enzymes
found
especially
in
muscle
particularly
creatine
kinase
increase
in
proportion
to
the
intensity
and
duration
of
the
preceding
exercise
peaking
24
hours
after
exercise
the
effect
of
duration
is
dominant
so
that
the
highest
postexercise
serum
enzyme
activities
are
found
after
very
prolonged
competitive
exercise
such
as
ultradistance
marathon
running
or
triathlon
events
Weight-bearing
exercises
which
include
eccentric
muscular
contractions
such
as
bench
stepping
and
downhill
running
induce
the
greatest
increases
in
serum
enzyme
activities
serum
enzyme
activities
increase
very
little
even
after
prolonged
participation
in
those
non-weight-bearing
activities
such
as
swimming
and
cycling
which
do
not
include
eccentric
muscular
contractions
Prolonged
(greater
than
2
hours)
daily
training
or
competition
in
weight-bearing
activities
produces
chronically
elevated
serum
enzyme
activities
Serum
enzyme
activities
increase
more
with
exercise
in
males
Blacks
and
the
untrained
than
they
do
in
females
Whites
and
the
trained
respectively
age
does
not
appear
to
influence
the
degree
to
which
serum
enzyme
activities
increase
with
exercise
There
is
a
remarkable
individual
variability
in
the
degree
to
which
serum
enzyme
activities
increase
with
exercise
a
50-fold
difference
in
post-race
serum
creatine
kinase
activities
has
been
found
in
healthy
and
equally
trained
athletes
completing
the
same
90km
ultramarathon
footrace
The
biochemical
explanation
for
this
degree
of
individual
variability
is
not
currently
understood
possibly
persons
who
show
abnormally
large
increases
in
serum
enzyme
activities
with
exercise
may
have
as
yet
unrecognised
subclinical
myopathies
No
circadian
rhythms
have
been
identified
for
serum
enzyme
activities
activities
rise
during
the
day
because
of
increased
physical
activity
The
rise
in
serum
enzyme
activities
is
greater
after
exercise
at
altitude
or
in
the
heat
than
after
equivalent
exercise
at
sea
level
or
in
the
cold
The
most
likely
explanation
for
the
increased
serum
enzyme
activities
that
follow
prolonged
weight-bearing
activities
that
also
cause
marked
muscle
soreness
is
myofibrillar
damage
in
particular
sarcomeric
Z-disk
