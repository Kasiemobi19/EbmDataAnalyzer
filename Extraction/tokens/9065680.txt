Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
this
12-week
double-blind
parallel
group
placebo-controlled
study
was
to
compare
paroxetine
with
clomipramine
in
367
patients
with
DSM-III-R
defined
panic
disorder
Efficacy
assessments
included
the
daily
panic
attack
diary
the
Clinical
Global
Impression
Scale
the
Hamilton
Anxiety
Rating
Scale
the
Marks
Sheehan
Phobia
Scale
and
the
Sheehan
Disability
Scale
Paroxetine
produced
significant
improvements
compared
with
placebo
in
various
measurements
of
panic
attack
frequency
and
was
as
effective
as
clomipramine
However
paroxetine
appeared
to
have
a
more
rapid
onset
of
action
than
clomipramine
in
reducing
the
number
of
panic
attacks
to
zero
There
was
an
equivalent
improvement
with
both
paroxetine
and
clomipramine
in
the
supportive
efficacy
variables
which
assessed
associated
aspects
of
therapeutic
improvement
Significantly
more
adverse
effects
were
reported
in
the
clomipramine
group
compared
with
the
paroxetine
group
while
there
was
no
difference
between
the
paroxetine
and
placebo
groups
