Title
Effects
of
behavioral
and
pharmacological
treatment
on
smokeless
tobacco
users
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
effects
of
2
mg
of
nicotine
polacrilex
versus
placebo
gum
and
of
group
behavioral
treatment
versus
minimal
contact
on
cessation
of
smokeless
tobacco
use
Participants
(N
=
210)
were
randomly
assigned
1
of
the
4
treatment
conditions
Withdrawal
symptoms
were
assessed
throughout
the
treatment
Follow-up
assessments
were
made
at
1
6
and
12
months
posttreatment
Survival
curve
analysis
showed
that
any
of
the
3
treatment
groups
involving
group
behavioral
therapy
or
placebo
gum
were
equally
effective
and
superior
to
the
minimal
contact
plus
2
mg
of
nicotine
gum
treatment
in
terms
of
abstinence
On
the
other
hand
withdrawal
symptoms
were
significantly
reduced
by
nicotine
gum
compared
with
placebo
during
the
initial
phases
of
cessation
The
ineffectiveness
of
nicotine
gum
on
treatment
outcome
may
be
attributed
to
its
similarity
with
smokeless
tobacco
