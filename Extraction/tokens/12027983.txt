Prospective
multicentre
study
of
the
natural

of
atherosclerotic
renal
artery
stenosis
in
patients
with
peripheral
vascular
disease
Abstract
Text
Many
patients
with
peripheral
vascular
disease
have
coincident
renal
artery
stenosis
The
present
study
characterized
the
natural
history
of
the
condition
Some
98
patients
(71
men)
with
more
than
50
per
cent
atherosclerotic
renal
artery
stenosis
(unilateral
64
bilateral
34)
were
recruited
prospectively
Measurements
of
serum
creatinine
blood
pressure
and
renal
size
were
recorded
at
baseline
and
every
6
months
for
a
minimum
of
2
years
Data
were
available
for
85
patients
with
a
minimum
follow-up
of
2
years
The
mean
age
was
71
(range
51-87)
years
All
52
patients
with
unilateral
renal
artery
stenosis
were
managed
conservatively
(group
1)
21
of
the
33
patients
with
bilateral
disease
had
no
intervention
(group
2)
and
the
remaining
12
had
angioplasty
or
reconstruction
(group
3)
The
overall
mortality
rate
was
32
per
cent
at
2
years
(27
patients)
and
this
was
similar
in
all
three
groups
In
only
three
patients
was
death
related
directly
to
renovascular
disease
coronary
disease
accounted
for
the
majority
of
deaths
All
three
patients
who
needed
dialysis
died
within
1
year
In
survivors
from
groups
1
and
3
there
was
a
significant
increase
in
serum
creatinine
concentration
at
follow-up
Blood
pressure
did
not
increase
significantly
Patients
with
renal
artery
stenosis
and
peripheral
vascular
disease
had
a
poor
prognosis
but
this
was
not
directly
attributable
to
renal
failure
