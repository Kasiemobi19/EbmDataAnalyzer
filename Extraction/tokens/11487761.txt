Immunization
of
HIV-infected
children
with
varicella
vaccine
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
safety
and
immunogenicity
of
varicella
vaccine
in
children
with
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)
infection
Children
(n
=
41)
who
were
mildly
affected
by
HIV
(Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
stage
N1
or
A1)
and
had
no
history
or
serum
antibody
indicative
of
prior
varicella
infection
were
immunized
with
two
doses
of
live
attenuated
varicella
vaccine
A
minority
of
the
vaccine
recipients
had
mild
local
or
systemic
reactions
Vaccination
had
no
effect
on
the
clinical
stage
of
HIV
or
the
HIV
RNA
plasma
load
CD4
cell
percentage
and
CD4
cell
count
were
marginally
decreased
at
week
4
after
the
first
vaccination
this
effect
was
no
longer
present
at
week
8
after
vaccination
Two
months
after
the
second
dose
of
vaccine
60%
of
vaccine
recipients
had
anti-varicella
antibody
in
their
serum
and
83%
had
a
positive
lymphocyte
proliferation
assay
response
to
varicella
antigen
On
the
basis
of
its
safety
and
immunogenicity
varicella
vaccine
should
be
considered
in
the
childhood
vaccines
given
to
mildly
affected
HIV-infected
children
