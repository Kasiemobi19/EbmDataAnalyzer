Title
Exercise
for
treating
fibromyalgia
syndrome
Abstract
Text
Fibromyalgia
(FMS)
is
a
syndrome
expressed
by
chronic
widespread
body
pain
which
leads
to
reduced
physical
function
and
frequent
use
of
health
care
services
Exercise
training
is
commonly
recommended
as
a
treatment
The
objective
of
this
systematic
review
was
to
examine
the
efficacy
of
exercise
training
as
an
treatment
for
FMS
We
searched
6
electronic
bibliographies
for
studies
of
exercise
training
in
FMS
MEDLINE
(1966-12/2000)
CINAHL
(1982-12/2000)
HealthSTAR
(1990-12/2000)
Sports
Discus
(1975-05/2000)
EMBASE
(1974-05/2000)
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
(2000
issue
4)
We
also
reviewed
the
reference
lists
from
identified
articles
including
reviews
and
meta-analyses
of
treatment
studies
Randomized
trials
focused
on
cardiorespiratory
endurance
muscle
strength
and/or
flexibility
as
treatment
for
FMS
were
selected
Two
reviewers
independently
identified
trials
meeting
inclusion
criteria
rated
the
methodologic
quality
using
2
standardized
validated
instruments
evaluated
the
adequacy
of
the
exercise
training
stimulus
using
the
American
College
of
Sports
Medicine
(ACSM)
criteria
and
evaluated
the
results
Disagreements
were
resolved
through
active
discussion
and
consensus
High
quality
training
studies
had
scores
of
50%
or
greater
on
van
Tulder
methodologic
criteria
and
met
the
minimum
training
standards
of
ACSM
Outcome
variables
were
grouped
into
7
constructs
pain
tender
points
physical
function
global
well
being
self
efficacy
fatigue
&
sleep
and
psychological
function
Two
reviewers
independently
extracted
data
on
study
characteristics
results
and
point
estimates
for
selected
variables
and
used
consensus
to
address
discrepancies
Sixteen
trials
involving
a
total
of
724
participants
were
assigned
at
random
to
exercise
intervention
groups
(n=379)
control
groups
(n=277)
or
groups
receiving
an
alternate
treatment
(n=68)
Seven
studies
were
high
quality
training
studies
4
aerobic
training
1
a
mixture
of
aerobic
strength
and
flexibility
training
1
strength
training
and
2
with
exercise
training
as
part
of
a
composite
treatment
Flexibility
protocols
were
never
described
in
sufficient
detail
to
allow
evaluation
The
four
high
quality
aerobic
training
studies
reported
significantly
greater
improvements
in
the
exercise
groups
versus
control
groups
in
aerobic
performance
(171%
increase
in
aerobic
performance
with
exercise
versus
05%
increase
in
the
control
groups)
tender
point
pain
pressure
threshold
(281%
increase
versus
70%
decrease)
and
improvements
in
pain
(114%
decrease
in
pain
versus
16%
increase)
Poor
description
of
exercise
protocols
was
common
with
insufficient
information
on
intensity
duration
frequency
and
mode
of
exercise
Adverse
events
were
also
poorly
reported
Supervised
aerobic
exercise
training
has
beneficial
effects
on
physical
capacity
and
FMS
symptoms
Strength
training
may
also
have
benefits
on
some
FMS
symptoms
Further
studies
on
muscle
strengthening
and
flexibility
are
needed
Research
on
the
long-term
benefit
of
exercise
for
FMS
is
needed
