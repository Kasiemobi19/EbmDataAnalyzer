Antimicrobial
prophylaxis
for
urinary
tract
infection
in
persons
with
spinal
cord
dysfunction
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
benefits
and
harms
of
antimicrobial
prophylaxis
to
prevent
urinary
tract
infections
(UTIs)
in
persons
with
neurogenic
bladders
caused
by
spinal
cord
dysfunction
A
broad
search
strategy
with
no
language
restriction
was
conducted
of
MEDLINE
(1966-January
1998)
EMBASE
(1974-January
1998)
and
CINAHL
(1982-July
1998)
using
the
general
search
terms
urinary
tract
urinary
tract
infections
bacteriuria
paraplegia
quadriplegia
spinal
cord
injuries
multiple
sclerosis
neurogenic
bladder
and
neuropathic
bladder
Additional
articles
were
identified
by
experts
and
by
reviewing
reference
lists
of
articles
obtained
from
searches
Criteria
included
human
studies
of
adults
and
adolescents
who
had
neurogenic
bladder
due
to
spinal
cord
dysfunction
the
studies
had
to
address
antimicrobial
prophylaxis
of
UTI
and
include
bacteriuria
or
UTI
as
an
outcome
We
excluded
any
study
that
was
clearly
not
a
controlled
trial
or
that
only
included
children
under
the
age
of
13
years
Two
reviewers
independently
abstracted
data
and
disagreements
were
resolved
by
consensus
Two
reviewers
independently
abstracted
data
and
disagreements
were
resolved
by
consensus
Studies
were
graded
by
1
project
investigator
according
to
quality
criteria
developed
by
Jadad
and
Schulz
The
sizes
of
the
effect
of
antimicrobial
prophylaxis
on
weekly
infection
rates
from
15
trials
that
met
the
inclusion
criteria
were
pooled
by
using
a
random
effects
model
Antimicrobial
prophylaxis
did
not
significantly
decrease
symptomatic
infections
Prophylaxis
was
associated
with
a
reduction
in
asymptomatic
bacteriuria
among
acute
patients
(<90d
after
spinal
cord
injury
P
<05)
1
patient
would
require
37
weeks
of
treatment
on
average
to
prevent
1
asymptomatic
infection
For
nonacute
patients
the
reduction
approached
statistical
significance
(P
=06)
Prophylaxis
resulted
in
an
approximately
twofold
increase
in
antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria
The
regular
use
of
antimicrobial
prophylaxis
for
most
patients
who
have
neurogenic
bladder
caused
by
spinal
cord
dysfunction
is
not
supported
A
clinically
important
effect
however
has
not
been
excluded
Future
research
should
focus
on
randomized
trials
in
those
patients
who
have
recurrent
UTIs
that
limit
their
daily
functioning
and
well-being
