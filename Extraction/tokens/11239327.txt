Title
Effects
of
knee
bracing
on
the
functional
performance
of
patients
with
anterior
cruciate
ligament
reconstruction
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
functional
performance
of
subjects
with
unilateral
anterior
cruciate
ligament
(ACL)
reconstruction
Cross-sectional
comparative
clinical
trial
A
physical
therapy
outpatient
department
Thirty-one
subjects
with
unilateral
ACL
reconstruction
for
more
than
5
months
Patients
under
3
bracing
conditions
(1)
DonJoy
Brace
(2)
mechanical
placebo
brace
or
(3)
no
brace
Running
and
turning
10
times
on
a
22-meter
figure-8
runway
and
running
and
jumping
(and
landing)
on
a
semicircular
path
Speed
of
running
and
turning
speed
of
running
and
jumping
and
accuracy
of
landing
after
the
jump
Subjects
performed
similarly
in
conditions
1
and
2
in
all
the
tests
but
the
speeds
of
running
and
turning
were
significantly
slower
in
conditions
1
and
2
than
condition
3
(p
=008--000)
Results
of
the
run
and
jump
tests
were
not
different
among
all
conditions
Knee
bracing
may
not
improve
functional
performance
of
subjects
5
months
after
ACL
reconstruction
The
use
of
such
a
brace
could
actually
slow
down
running
and
turning
irrespective
of
the
mechanical
constraints
of
the
brace
These
functional
outcomes
need
to
be
noted
when
such
a
brace
is
used
on
this
group
of
subjects
