Addition

Abstract
Text
Anti-leukotriene
(AL)
agents
are
being
considered
as
'add-on'
therapy
to
inhaled
corticosteroids
(ICS)
in
chronic
asthma
To
examine
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
daily
AL
plus
ICS
compared
to
ICS
alone
and
determine
the
corticosteroid-sparing
effect
of
AL
when
added
to
ICS
in
chronic
asthma

In

With

comparing
the
use
of

of
anti-leukotrienes
with
increasing
the
dose
of
inhaled
glucocorticoids
no
firm
conclusion
can
be
drawn
about
the
equivalence
of
both
treatment
options
In
ICS-sparing
studies
of
patients
who
were
well
controlled
at
baseline
addition
of
anti-leukotrienes
produced
no
overall
difference
in
dose
of
inhaled
glucocorticoids
(WMD
-21

but
it
was

The
addition
of
licensed
doses
of
anti-leukotrienes
to
add-on
therapy
to
inhaled
glucocorticoids
brings
modest
improvement
in
lung
function
Although
addition
of
anti-leukotrienes
to
inhaled
glucocorticoids
appears
comparable
to
increasing
the
dose
of
inhaled
steroids
the
power
of
the
review
is
insufficient
to
confirm
the
equivalence
of
both
treatment
options
Addition
of
anti-leukotrienes
is
associated
with
superior
asthma
control
after
glucocorticoid
tapering
although
the
glucocorticoid-sparing
effect
cannot
be
quantified
at
present
it
appears
modest
