A
comparison
of
outpatient
hysteroscopy
with
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
Abstract
Text
To
establish
the
accuracy
of
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
in
diagnosing
uterine
pathology
when
compared
with
outpatient
hysteroscopy
Prospective
parallel
blinded
comparative
study
Outpatient
hysteroscopy
clinic
in
a
large
university
teaching
hospital
All
women
referred
for
outpatient
hysteroscopy
in
a
15-month
period
Women
underwent
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
followed
by
flexible
hysteroscopy
The
ultrasonographer
was
blinded
to
the
hysteroscopy
result
and
the
gynaecologist
was
blinded
to
the
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
result
The
relative
success
rates
and
pain
scores
for
each
procedure
The
validity
of
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
as
a
diagnostic
test
One
hundred
and
seventeen
women
entered
the
study
70
women
were
premenopausal
and
47
postmenopausal
In
27
women
one
or
both
procedures
could
not
be
performed
Saline
infusion
hysterosonography
failed
in
20
women
on
one
occasion
hysteroscopy
failed
and
both
investigations
failed
in
six
women
Ninety
cases
remained
for
direct
comparison
with
78
cases
of
agreement
on
the
uterine
findings
in
both
investigations
Twelve
cases
disagreed
in
one
case
an
adhesion
was
seen
two
cases
with
polyps
and
five
with
fibroids
seen
on
ultrasound
but
not
seen
on
hysteroscopy
There
were
four
cases
where
polyps
were
identified
on
hysteroscopy
but
not
on
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
The
median
pain
scores
were
16
for
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
and
32
for
hysteroscopy
Both
saline
infusion
hysterosonography
and
hysteroscopy
are
well
tolerated
by
women
Saline
infusion
hysterosonography
has
a
high
failure
rate
but
has
a
lower
pain
score
than
hysteroscopy
