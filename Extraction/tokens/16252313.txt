Abstract
Text
This
review
compares
the
two
most
popular
treatments
for
haemorrhoids
namely
rubber
band
ligation
(RBL)
and
excisional
haemorrhoidectomy
Randomized
trials
were
identified
from
the
major
electronic
databases
Symptom
control
retreatment
postoperative
pain
complications
time
off
work
and
patient
satisfaction
were
assessed
Relative
risk
(RR)
and
weighted
mean
difference
with
95
per
cent
confidence
interval
(ci)
were
estimated
using
a
random-effects
model
for
dichotomous
and
continuous
outcomes
respectively
Three
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
and
all
were
of
poor
methodological
quality
Complete
remission
of
haemorrhoidal
symptoms
was
better
after
haemorrhoidectomy
(RR
168
(95
per
cent
ci
100
to
283))
There
was
significant
heterogeneity
between
the
studies
(I(2)
=
905
per
cent
P
<
0001)
Fewer
patients
required
retreatment
after
haemorrhoidectomy
(RR
020
(95
per
cent
ci
009
to
040))
but
anal
stenosis
postoperative
haemorrhage
and
incontinence
to
flatus
were
more
common
with
this
operation
Haemorrhoidectomy
produced
better
long-term
symptom
control
in
patients
with
grade
III
haemorrhoids
but
was
associated
with
more
postoperative
complications
than
RBL
