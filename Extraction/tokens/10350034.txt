Effect

on

inhibitors
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
possible
influence
of
buspirone
on
sexual
dysfunction
in
depressed
patients
treated
with
a
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
(SSRI)
we
analyzed
data
from
a
placebo-controlled
trial
designed
to
explore
the
efficacy
of
buspirone
as
add-on
treatment
for
patients
not
responding
to
an
SSRI
alone
At
baseline
all
patients
met
the
criteria
for
a
major
depressive
episode
according
to
DSM-IV
and
had
received
citalopram
or
paroxetine
during
a
minimum
of
4
weeks
without
responding
to
the
treatment
Buspirone
(flexible
dosage
20-60
mg/day)
or
placebo
was
added
to
the
SSRI
for
4
weeks
the
mean
daily
dose
of
buspirone
at
endpoint
was
485
mg
(SD
=
10)
Sexual
dysfunction
was
evaluated
using
a
structured
interview
Before
starting
medication
with
buspirone
or
placebo
40%
(47
of
117)
reported
at
least
one
kind
of
sexual
dysfunction
(decreased
libido
ejaculatory
dysfunction
orgasmic
dysfunction)
During
the
4
weeks
of
treatment
approximately
58%
of
subjects
treated
with
buspirone
reported
an
improvement
with
respect
to
sexual
function
in
the
placebo
group
the
response
rate
was
30%
The
difference
between
placebo
and
active
drug
treatment
was
more
pronounced
in
women
than
in
men
The
response
was
obvious
during
the
first
week
with
no
further
improvement
during
the
course
of
the
study
It
is
suggested
that
the
effect
of
buspirone
on
sexual
dysfunction
is
a
result
of
a
reversal
of
SSRI-induced
sexual
side
effects
rather
than
of
an
antidepressant
effect
of
the
drug
