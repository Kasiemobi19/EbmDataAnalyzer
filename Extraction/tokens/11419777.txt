Title
Refusal
of
treatment
Abstract
Text
Patients'
thoughts
feelings
and
desires
are
communicated
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
require
sympathetic
critical
interpretation
Patients
need
clear
evidence-based
medical
information
so
that
they
can
make
their
own
decisions
about
whether
to
consent
to
or
refuse
medical
treatment
Treatment
refusal
may
provide
an
opportunity
to
introduce
patients
to
advance
care
planning
Unconscious
motivations
in
doctors
may
obstruct
good
clinical
decision-making
Although
respect
for
the
patient's
responsibility
to
make
healthcare
decisions
should
be
a
condition
of
the
clinical
relationship
healthcare
decision-making
is
a
collaborative
process
