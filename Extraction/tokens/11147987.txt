Title
Short-term
prognosis
after
emergency
department
diagnosis
of
TIA
Abstract
Text
Management
of
patients
with
acute
transient
ischemic
attack
(TIA)
varies
widely
with
some
institutions
admitting
all
patients
and
others
proceeding
with
outpatient
evaluations
Defining
the
short-term
prognosis
and
risk
factors
for
stroke
after
TIA
may
provide
guidance
in
determining
which
patients
need
rapid
evaluation
To
determine
the
short-term
risk
of
stroke
and
other
adverse
events
after
emergency
department
(ED)
diagnosis
of
TIA
Cohort
study
conducted
from
March
1997
through
February
1998
in
16
hospitals
in
a
health
maintenance
organization
in
northern
California
Patients
A
total
of
1707
patients
(mean
age
72
years)
identified
by
ED
physicians
as
having
presented
with
TIA
Risk
of
stroke
during
the
90
days
after
index
TIA
other
events
including
death
recurrent
TIA
and
hospitalization
for
cardiovascular
events
During
the
90
days
after
index
TIA
180
patients
(105%)
returned
to
the
ED
with
a
stroke
91
of
which
occurred
in
the
first
2
days
Five
factors
were
independently
associated
with
stroke

Stroke
or
other
adverse
events
occurred
in
428
patients
(251%)
in
the
90
days
after
the
TIA
and
included
44
hospitalizations
for
cardiovascular
events
(26%)
45
deaths
(26%)
and
216
recurrent
TIAs
(127%)
Our
results
indicate
that
the
short-term
risk
of
stroke
and
other
adverse
events
among
patients
who
present
to
an
ED
with
a
TIA
is
substantial
Characteristics
of
the
patient
and
the
TIA
may
be
useful
for
identifying
patients
who
may
benefit
from
expeditious
evaluation
and
treatment
