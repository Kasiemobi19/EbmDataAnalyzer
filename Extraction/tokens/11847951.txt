Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
number
of
cases
of
statin-associated
rhabdomyolysis
reported
to
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
for
6
statins
and
to
profile
the
cases
A
retrospective
analysis
of
all
domestic
and
foreign
reports
of
statin-associated
rhabdomyolysis
between
November
1997
and
March
2000
was
conducted
Outcome
measures
included
the
total
number
of
reports
(initial
plus
follow-up)
the
number
of
unique
cases
age
gender
percentages
of
report
codes
and
role
codes
and
frequencies
of
concomitant
interacting
drugs
that
may
have
precipitated
rhabdomyolysis
outcomes
codes
and
report
source
codes
There
were
871
reports
of
statin-associated
rhabdomyolysis
in
the
29-month
time
frame
examined
representing
601
cases
The
following
number
of
cases
were
associated
with
each
of
the
individual
statins
simvastatin
215
(358%)
cerivastatin
192
(319%)
atorvastatin
73
(122%)
pravastatin
71
(118%)
lovastatin
40
(67%)
and
fluvastatin
10
(17%)
Drugs
that
may
have
interacted
with
the
statins
were
present
in
the
following
number
of
cases
mibefradil
(n
=
99)
fibrates
(n
=
80)
cyclosporine
(n
=
51)
macrolide
antibiotics
(n
=
42)
warfarin
(n
=
33)
digoxin
(n
=
26)
and
azole
antifungals
(n
=
12)
The
reports
of
621%
of
cases
were
classified
as
expedited
Statins
were
designated
as
the
primary
suspect
in
720%
of
the
cases
Death
was
listed
as
the
outcome
in
38
cases
The
majority
of
reports
(n
=
556)
were
from
health
professionals
Compared
with
the
other
statins
simvastatin
and
cerivastatin
were
implicated
in
a
relatively
higher
number
of
reports
Because
of
the
various
limitations
of
a
spontaneous
reporting-system
database
caution
is
urged
when
interpreting
the
relative
number
of
cases
reported
