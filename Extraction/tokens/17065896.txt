A
randomized
study
of
the
effects
of
gabapentin
on
postamputation
pain
Abstract
Text
Pain
after
amputation
is
common
but
difficult
to
treat
Therefore
the
authors
examined
whether
postoperative
treatment
with
gabapentin
could
reduce
postamputation
stump
and
phantom
pain
Forty-six
patients
scheduled
to
undergo
lower
limb
amputation
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
oral
gabapentin
or
placebo
Treatment
was
started
on
the
first
postoperative
day
and
continued
for
30
days
The
daily
dose
of
gabapentin
or
placebo
was
gradually
increased
to
2400
mg/day
The
intensity
of
stump
and
phantom
pain
was
recorded
every
day
on
a
numeric
rating
scale
(0-10)
during
the
30-day
treatment
period
Five
interviews
were
performed
after
7
14
and
30
days
and
after
3
and
6
months
Results
from
41
patients
were
included
in
the
data
analysis
The
risk
of
phantom
pain
(gabapentin
vs
placebo)
was
550%
versus
526%
(risk
difference
24%
95%
confidence
interval
-289
to
337%
P
=
088
30
days)
and
588%
versus
500%
(risk
difference
88%
95%
confidence
interval
-233
to
409%
P
=
059
6
months)
The
median
intensity
of
phantom
pain
(gabapentin
vs
placebo)
was
15
(range
0-90)
versus
12
(range
0-66)
(P
=
060
30
days)
and
10
(range
0-60)
versus
05
(range
0-50)
(P
=
077
6
months)
The
median
intensity
of
stump
pain
was
085
(range
0-82)
versus
10
(range
0-54)
(P
=
068
30
days)
and
0
(range
0-80)
versus
0
(range
0-50)
(P
=
058
6
months)
Gabapentin
administered
in
the
first
30
postoperative
days
after
amputation
does
not
reduce
the
incidence
or
intensity
of
postamputation
pain
