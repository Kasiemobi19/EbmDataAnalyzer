Title
Klinefelter
syndrome
Abstract
Text
Klinefelter
syndrome
is
the
most
common
sex
chromosome
disorder
Affected
males
carry
an
additional
X
chromosome
which
results
in
male
hypogonadism
androgen
deficiency
and
impaired
spermatogenesis
Some
patients
may
exhibit
all
of
the
classic
signs
of
this
disorder
including
gynecomastia
small
testes
sparse
body
hair
tallness
and
infertility
whereas
others
because
of
the
wide
variability
in
clinical
expression
lack
many
of
these
features
Treatment
consists
of
testosterone
replacement
therapy
to
correct
the
androgen
deficiency
and
to
provide
patients
with
appropriate
virilization
This
therapy
also
has
positive
effects
on
mood
and
self-esteem
and
has
been
shown
to
protect
against
osteoporosis
although
it
will
not
reverse
infertility
Although
the
diagnosis
of
Klinefelter
syndrome
is
now
made
definitively
using
chromosomal
karyotyping
revealing
in
most
instances
a
47XXY
genotype
the
diagnosis
also
can
be
made
using
a
careful
history
and
results
of
a
physical
examination
with
the
hallmark
being
small
firm
testes
As
it
affects
1
in
500
male
patients
and
presents
with
a
variety
of
clinical
features
primary
care
physicians
should
be
familiar
with
this
condition
