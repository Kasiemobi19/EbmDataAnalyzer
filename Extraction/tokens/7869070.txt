Recall
bias
in
case-control
studies
an
empirical
analysis
and
theoretical
framework
Abstract
Text
Previous
work
has
suggested
that
recall
bias
in
case-control
studies
may
be
more
serious
when
the
overall
study
quality
is
lower
This
paper
summarizes
a
systematic
literature
search
to
examine
the
question
All
relevant
studies
published
between
1966
and
1990
were
included
if
they
met
the
following
criteria
(1)
they
represented
original
work
(2)
they
used
a
human
population
(3)
they
used
a
case-control
design
(4)
they
had
a
"validated"
gold
standard
applied
equally
to
cases
and
controls
and
(5)
they
reported
at
least
one
of
crude
agreement
rates
chance-corrected
agreement
rates
(kappa)
sensitivity
or
specificity
Sixteen
such
studies
were
identified
No
relationship
was
found
between
the
absolute
differences
in
agreement
between
cases
and
controls
and
the
overall
level
of
agreement
in
contradiction
to
suggestions
in
previous
literature
Comparisons
of
the
data
quality
for
cases
and
controls
using
either
the
crude
agreement
level
kappa
sensitivity
or
specificity
gave
linear
relationships
with
correlations
of
081
078
058
and
062
respectively
Kappas
were
generally
lower
than
the
corresponding
crude
agreement
levels
and
specificities
were
higher
than
sensitivities
When
used
together
these
types
of
comparisons
can
give
valuable
information
regarding
(1)
the
possible
existence
of
differential
recall
in
a
particular
study
and
(2)
the
quality
of
that
study
A
theoretical
framework
is
proposed
for
use
in
these
areas
