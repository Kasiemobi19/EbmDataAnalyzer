Influence
of
removal
of
intrauterine
contraceptive
devices
on
colonisation
of
the
cervix
by
actinomyces-like
organisms
Abstract
Text
An
overall
prevalence
rate
of
actinomyces-like
organisms
(ALO)
in
cervical
smears
from
intrauterine
contraceptive
device
(IUCD)
users
of
3%
(79/2
734)
was
found
with
a
rate
of
2%
and
226%
for
copper
and
inert
IUCD
users
Although
the
users
of
the
inert
IUCDs
were
older
and
their
devices
had
been
in
situ
longer
these
factors
did
not
account
for
the
significant
difference
between
the
two
types
of
IUCD
Fifty-five
patients
were
counselled
and
given
a
leaflet
on
ALO
Fourteen
IUCD
users
with
ALO
positive
smears
who
had
their
devices
removed
had
mild
or
moderate
pelvic
pain
or
discharge
Six
others
who
were
asymptomatic
had
the
IUCD
removed
at
their
own
request
All
fifty-five
patients
were
re-examined
six
months
to
one
year
later
and
a
smear
was
repeated
Only
one
woman
required
later
removal
of
the
IUCD
because
of
dyspareunia
with
pelvic
tenderness
After
removal
of
the
IUCD
and
without
antibiotic
therapy
in
100%
(20/20)
of
the
women
ALO
colonisation
was
no
longer
found
six
to
twelve
months
later
This
applied
even
to
seven
women
who
had
had
a
new
copper
IUCD
inserted
immediately
after
removal
of
the
index
device
An
overall
prevalence
rate
of
actinomyces-like
organisms
(ALO)
in
cervical
smears
of
IUD
users
of
3%
(79/2734)
was
found
with
a
rate
of
2%
and
226%
for
copper
and
inert
IUD
users
Although
the
users
of
the
inert
IUDs
were
older
and
their
devices
had
been
in
situ
longer
these
factors
did
not
account
for
the
significant
differences
between
the
2
types
of
IUD
55
patients
were
counseled
and
given
a
leaflet
on
ALO
14
IUD
users
with
ALO
positive
smears
who
had
their
devices
removed
had
mild
or
moderate
pelvic
pain
or
discharge
6
others
who
were
asymptomatic
had
the
IUD
removed
at
their
own
request
All
55
patients
were
reexamined
6
months-1
year
later
and
a
smear
was
repeated
Only
1
woman
required
later
removal
of
the
IUD
because
of
dyspareunia
with
pelvic
tenderness
After
IUD
removal
and
without
antibiotic
therapy
ALO
colonization
was
no
longer
found
6-12
months
later
in
100%
(20/20)
of
the
cases
This
even
included
the
7
women
who
had
had
new
copper
IUDs
inserted
immediately
after
removal
of
the
index
device
