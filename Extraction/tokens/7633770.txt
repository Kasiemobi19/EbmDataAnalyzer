Shave
excision
of
benign
papular
naevocytic
naevi
Abstract
Text
Patients
frequently
request
removal
of
benign
papular
naevi
for
cosmetic
or
functional
reasons
Shave
excision
plus
electrocautery
is
probably
the
most
widely
used
method
of
removal
but
this
method
is
said
to
result
in
retained
hair
or
pigment
if
deeply
pigmented
or
hairy
naevi
are
treated
In
a
prospective
study
82
benign
papular
naevi
of
all
types
were
treated
by
shave
excision
using
hot-wire
electrocautery
for
haemostasis
Details
of
the
naevi
were
accurately
recorded
before
treatment
and
reassessment
of
shave
sites
carried
out
at
6-8
months
At
review
a
scar
was
visible
at
only
63%
(52/82)
of
shave
sites
and
all
of
these
were
cosmetically
acceptable
Only
27%
(15/55)
of
the
initially
pigmented
naevi
retained
pigment
and
only
24%
(5/21)
of
the
initially
hairy
naevi
regrew
hair
Shave
excision
and
electrocautery
of
benign
naevi
including
hairy
and
deeply
pigmented
ones
produce
excellent
cosmetic
results
The
patient
must
be
warned
that
there
is
a
potential
risk
of
a
scar
or
pigment
remaining
after
shave
excision
of
any
naevus
and
for
hair
regrowth
after
shave
excision
of
hairy
naevi
