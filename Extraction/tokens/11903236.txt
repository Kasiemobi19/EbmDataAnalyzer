Terbinafine
(Lamisil)
treatment
of
toenail
onychomycosis
in
patients
with
insulin-dependent
and
non-insulin-dependent
diabetes

a
multicentre
trial
Abstract
Text
Diabetes
mellitus
(DM)
affects
an
estimated
175
million
people
world-wide
Approximately
one-third
of
patients
with
DM
have
toenail
onychomycosis
To
determine
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
terbinafine
treatment
of
toenail
onychomycosis
in
patients
with
DM
receiving
insulin
and/or
oral
antidiabetic
agents
Special
interest
was
focused
on
potential
drug
interactions
with
oral
hypoglycaemic
substances
In
a
multicentre
trial
patients
suffering
from
insulin-dependent
DM
(IDDM)
or
non-
insulin-dependent
DM
(NIDDM)
with
toenail
onychomycosis
were
treated
for
12
weeks
with
oral
terbinafine
250
mg
daily
and
followed
up
to
48
weeks
In
addition
to
clinical
mycological
and
laboratory
investigations
blood
glucose
levels
were
monitored
At
the
end
of
the
trial
(week
48)
a
mycological
cure
rate
of
73%
was
achieved
The
rates
of
clinical
cure
and
complete
cure
(mycological
cure
plus
clinical
cure)
were
57%
and
48%
respectively
There
was
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
the
NIDDM
and
IDDM
groups
with
respect
to
the
cure
rates
(P
>
005)
No
hypoglycaemic
episode
was
reported
and
none
of
the
patients
had
hypoglycaemia
during
the
treatment
phase
With
excellent
cure
rates
and
a
good
tolerability
profile
terbinafine
should
continue
to
be
a
drug
of
choice
for
the
treatment
of
toenail
onychomycosis
in
the
rising
number
of
NIDDM
patients
receiving
multiple
medication
