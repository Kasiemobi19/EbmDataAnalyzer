Rationale
and
design
of
the
carvedilol
or
metoprolol
European
trial
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
COMET
Abstract
Text
In
large
clinical
trials
both
carvedilol
and
metoprolol
have
been
shown
to
reduce
mortality
and
morbidity
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
Carvedilol
is
an
adrenoceptor
antagonist
which
inhibits
beta(1)-
beta(2)-
and
alpha(1)-adrenergic
receptors
Carvedilol
has
additional
metabolic
and
antioxidant
properties
Metoprolol
is
a
selective
antagonist
of
beta(1)-adrenergic
receptors
The
carvedilol
or
metoprolol
European
trial
(COMET)
is
the
first
study
to
investigate
whether
beta-blocking
agents
with
differing
pharmacological
profiles
exert
different
effects
on
morbidity
and
mortality
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
3029
patients
from
15
different
European
countries
were
enrolled
into
COMET
and
will
be
followed
until
1020
fatal
events
have
been
observed
unless
the
data
and
safety
monitoring
committee
(DSMC)
recommends
early
termination
The
target
dose
for
carvedilol
is
25
mg
bid
and
for
metoprolol
tartrate
50
mg
bid
This
manuscript
outlines
the
rationale
design
and
possible
outcomes
of
COMET
