Abstract
Text
To
assess
compliance
with
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)
screening-based
protocol
for
obstetric
group
B
Streptococcus
(GBS)
and
to
determine
an
acceptable
threshold
for
protocol
failure
A
retrospective
chart
review
was
carried
out
for
all
deliveries
performed
through
the
resident-run
community
clinic
from
January
through
June
1999
Compliance
with
the
CDC
protocol
was
assessed
by
reviewing
collected
data
from
patient
charts
and
comparing
it
to
CDC
requirements
Data
were
collected
regarding
patient
demographics
antenatal
GBS
status
gestational
age
at
screening
time
of
rupture
of
the
membranes
time
the
antibiotic
was
given
and
time
of
delivery
A
total
of
248
charts
were
reviewed
Elective
cesarean
deliveries
were
excluded
(25
charts)
Unknown
culture
status
was
found
for
22
(99%)
patients
Cultures
were
collected
before
35
weeks'
gestation
in
39
(175%)
patients
and
at
>
37
weeks'
gestation
in
28
(126%)
patients
Of
those
with
known
positive
GBS
status
4
(70%)
were
not
treated
and
antibiotics
were
given
less
than
four
hours
before
delivery
in
13
(245%)
patients
Of
those
with
unknown
status
six
(272%)
were
not
treated
Overall
there
was
70%
compliance
with
the
culture
collection
arm
of
the
protocol
and
87%
compliance
with
the
treatment
arm
Fulfillment
of
CDC
guidelines
in
this
community
setting
is
imperfect
There
are
several
areas
beyond
physician
control
including
precipitous
delivery
and
patient
non-compliance
However
perhaps
an
acceptable
threshold
for
limitations
of
adherence
to
the
protocol
can
be
reached
