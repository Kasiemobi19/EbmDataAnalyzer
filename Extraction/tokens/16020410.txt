Title
Prevention
of
and
therapies
for
nipple
pain
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
review
the
literature
on
nipple
pain
and
to
delineate
effective
strategies
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
nipple
pain
in
breastfeeding
mothers
Computerized
searches
on
MEDLINE
Pre-MEDLINE
CINAHL
and
the
Cochrane
Library
Articles
from
indexed
journals
relevant
to
the
objective
were
reviewed
from
January
1983
to
April
2004
Preference
was
given
to
research-based
studies
in
English
Data
were
extracted
and
organized
under
two
headings
prevention
of
nipple
pain
or
trauma
and
treatment
of
nipple
pain
or
trauma
The
Critical
Appraisal
Form
by
J
Briggs
was
used
to
extract
the
data
from
research-based
articles
The
health
benefits
of
breastfeeding
for
mother
and
infant
are
well
documented
however
nipple
pain
is
a
common
reason
reported
by
women
for
the
early
termination
of
breastfeeding
Several
studies
have
compared
various
treatments
for
either
the
prevention
of
or
treatment
for
nipple
pain
These
treatments
include
warm
water
compresses
tea
bag
compresses
heat
application
of
expressed
mother's
milk
lanolin
vitamin
A
collagenase
dexpanthenol
hydrogel
therapy
glycerin
gel
therapy
moist
occlusive
dressing
education
regarding
proper
latch-on
and
positioning
and
no
treatment
No
one
topical
agent
showed
superior
results
in
the
relief
of
nipple
discomfort
The
most
important
factor
in
decreasing
the
incidence
of
nipple
pain
is
the
provision
of
education
in
relation
to
proper
breastfeeding
technique
and
latch-on
as
well
as
anticipatory
guidance
regarding
the
high
incidence
of
early
postpartum
nipple
pain
