Title
Methotrexate
for
ankylosing
spondylitis
Abstract
Text
Ankylosing
spondylitis
(AS)
is
a
chronic
inflammatory
disease
of
unknown
cause
characterised
by
sacroiliitis
and
spondylitis
Generally
treatment
is
limited
to
the
alleviation
of
symptoms
using
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
Recently
disease-modifying
antirheumatic
drugs
(DMARDs)
have
been
used
for
patients
for
whom
NSAIDs
do
not
work
Methotrexate
(MTX)
a
widely
used
DMARD
is
effective
for
rheumatoid
arthritis
(RA)
and
so
might
work
for
AS
too
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
MTX
for
treating
AS
We
conducted
searches
in
any
language
in
CENTRAL
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
4
2005)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
November
20
2005)
EMBASE
(1980
to
November
20
2005)
CINAHL
(1982
to
November
20
2005)
and
the
reference
sections
of
retrieved
articles
Randomised
and
quasi-randomised
trials
examining
the
efficacy
of
MTX
versus
placebo
other
medication
or
no
medication
for
AS
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
unblinded
trial
reports
for
inclusion
assessed
methodological
quality
and
entered
trial
data
into
RevMan
42
using
the
double-entry
facility
Disagreements
were
resolved
by
a
third
reviewer
In
the
absence
of
significant
heterogeneity
results
for
continuous
data
were
combined
using
weighted
mean
difference
or
standardised
mean
difference
Relative
risk
was
used
for
dichotomous
data
Three
trials
involving
116
patients
were
included
One
12-month
trial
compared
naproxen
plus
MTX
with
naproxen
alone
Two
24-week
trials
compared
different
doses
of
MTX
with
placebo
No
statistically
significant
differences
were
found
for
the
primary
outcome
measures
of
physical
function
pain
spinal
mobility
peripheral
joints/entheses
pain
swelling
and
tenderness
changes
in
spine
radiographs
and
patient
and
physician
global
assessment
Only
the
response
rate
in
one
trial
showed
a
statistically
significant
benefit
of
36%
in
the
MTX
group
compared
to
the
placebo
group
(RR
318
95%
CI
103
to
979)
This
response
rate
was
a
composite
index
that
included
assessments
of
morning
stiffness
physical
well-being
Bath
ankylosing
spondylitis
disease
activity
index
(BASDAI)
Bath
ankylosing
spondylitis
functional
index
(BASFI)
health
assessment
questionnaire
for
spondyloarthropathies
(HAQ-S)
and
physician
and
patient
global
assessment
However
no
single
outcome
showed
a
statistically
significant
difference
between
the
MTX
and
placebo
groups
when
endpoint
results
were
compared
Therefore
this
benefit
of
MTX
is
questionable
No
serious
side
effects
were
reported
in
these
trials
There
is
not
enough
evidence
to
support
any
benefit
of
MTX
in
the
treatment
of
AS
High-quality
randomised
controlled
trials
of
longer
durations
and
with
larger
sample
sizes
are
needed
to
clarify
the
effect(s)
of
MTX
on
AS
