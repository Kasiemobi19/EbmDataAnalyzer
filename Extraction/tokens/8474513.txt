Reducing
mortality
from
colorectal
cancer
by
screening
for
fecal
occult
blood
Minnesota

Abstract
Text
Although
tests
for
occult
blood
in
the
feces
are
widely
used
to
screen
for
colorectal
cancers
there
is
no
conclusive
evidence
that
they
reduce
mortality
from
this
cause
We
evaluated
a
fecal
occult-blood
test
in
a
randomized
trial
and
documented
its
effectiveness
We
randomly
assigned
46551
participants
50
to
80
years
of
age
to
screening
for
colorectal
cancer
once
a
year
to
screening
every
two
years
or
to
a
control
group
Participants
who
were
screened
submitted
six
guaiac-impregnated
paper
slides
with
two
smears
from
each
of
three
consecutive
stools
About
83
percent
of
the
slides
were
rehydrated
Participants
who
tested
positive
underwent
a
diagnostic
evaluation
that
included
colonoscopy
Vital
status
was
ascertained
for
all
study
participants
during
13
years
of
follow-up
A
committee
determined
causes
of
death
A
single
pathologist
determined
the
stage
of
each
tissue
specimen
Differences
in
mortality
from
colorectal
cancer
the
primary
study
end
point
were
monitored
with
the
sequential
log-rank
statistic
The
13-year
cumulative
mortality
per
1000
from
colorectal
cancer
was
588
in
the
annually
screened
group
(95
percent
confidence
interval
461
to
715)
833
in
the
biennially
screened
group
(95
percent
confidence
interval
682
to
984)
and
883
in
the
control
group
(95
percent
confidence
interval
726
to
1040)
The
rate
in
the
annually
screened
group
but
not
in
the
biennially
screened
group
was
significantly
lower
than
that
in
the
control
group
Reduced
mortality
in
the
annually
screened
group
was
accompanied
by
improved
survival
in
those
with
colorectal
cancer
and
a
shift
to
detection
at
an
earlier
stage
of
cancer
Annual
fecal
occult-blood
testing
with
rehydration
of
the
samples
decreased
the
13-year
cumulative
mortality
from
colorectal
cancer
by
33
percent
