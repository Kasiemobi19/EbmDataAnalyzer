Title
Electromyography
of
idiopathic
toe
walking
Abstract
Text
Eighteen
idiopathic
toe
walkers
were
evaluated
by
gait
electromyography
to
define
muscle
timing
abnormalities
This
group
was
compared
with
a
matched
group
of
normal
children
walking
on
their
toes
and
to
a
group
of
patients
with
cerebral
palsy
and
equinus
deformities
Although
timing
in
all
three
groups
differed
from
normal
timing
the
two
patient
groups
showed
some
statistically
significant
differences
in
phasic
timing
from
the
control
group
However
no
significant
differences
existed
between
toe
walking
and
spastic
children
Historical
data
(family
history
male
predominance
and
learning
disabilities)
suggest
that
idiopathic
toe
walking
is
a
true
entity
although
the
gait
electromyograms
were
not
diagnostic
