Bed
rest
with
or
without
hospitalisation
for
hypertension
during
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
Bed
rest
or
restriction
of
activity
with
or
without
hospitalisation
have
been
advocated
for
women
with
hypertension
during
pregnancy
to
improve
pregnancy
outcome
However
benefits
need
to
be
demonstrated
before
such
interventions
can
be
recommended
since
restricted
activity
may
be
disruptive
to
women's
lives
expensive
and
increase
the
risk
of
thromboembolism
To
assess
the
effects
on
the
mother
and
the
baby
of
different
degrees
of
bed
rest
compared
with
each
other
and
with
routine
activity
in
hospital
or
at
home
for
primary
treatment
of
hypertension
during
pregnancy
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group's
Trials
Register
(April
2005)
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
1
2005)
and
EMBASE
(January
2002
to
December
2004)
Randomised
trials
evaluating
bed
rest
for
women
with
hypertension
in
pregnancy
were
selected
Two
review
authors
assessed
trials
for
inclusion
independently
and
extracted
data
Data
were
entered
into
RevMan
software
and
double-checked
Four
small
trials
(449
women)
were
included
Three
were
of
good
quality
Two
trials
(145
women)
compared
strict
bed
rest
with
some
rest
in
hospital
for
women
with
proteinuric
hypertension
There
was
insufficient
evidence
to
demonstrate
any
differences
between
the
groups
for
reported
outcomes
Two
trials
(304
women)
compared
some
bed
rest
in
hospital
with
routine
activity
at
home
for
non-proteinuric
hypertension
There
was
reduced
risk
of
severe
hypertension
(1
trial
218
women
RR
058
95%
CI
038
to
089)
and
a
borderline
reduction
in
risk
of
preterm
birth
(1
trial
218
women
RR
053
CI
029
to
099)
with
some
rest
compared
to
normal
activity
More
women
in
the
bed
rest
group
opted
not
to
have
the
same
management
in
future
pregnancies
if
the
choice
were
given
(1
trial
86
women
RR
300
95%
CI
143
to
631)
There
were
no
significant
differences
for
any
other
outcomes
Few
randomised
trials
have
evaluated
rest
for
women
with
hypertension
during
pregnancy
and
important
information
on
side-effects
and
cost
implication
is
missing
from
available
trials
Although
one
small
trial
suggests
that
some
bed
rest
may
be
associated
with
reduced
risk
of
severe
hypertension
and
preterm
birth
these
findings
need
to
be
confirmed
in
larger
trials
At
present
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
provide
clear
guidance
for
clinical
practice
Therefore
bed
rest
should
not
be
recommended
routinely
for
hypertension
in
pregnancy
especially
since
more
women
appear
to
prefer
unrestricted
activity
if
the
choice
were
given
