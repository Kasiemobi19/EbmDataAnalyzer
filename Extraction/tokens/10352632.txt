Title
Risk
factors
for
resistance
to
"first-line"
antimicrobials
among
urinary
tract
isolates
of
Escherichia
coli
in
children
Abstract
Text
There
are
increasing
concerns
regarding
antimicrobial
resistance
in
Canada
Data
are
limited
on
the
prevalence
patterns
of
resistance
and
risk
factors
associated
with
resistant
organisms
including
coliforms
in
children
This
study
was
done
to
address
these
issues
as
they
relate
to
urinary
tract
isolates
of
Escherichia
coli
in
a
tertiary
care
pediatric
centre
in
Ottawa
A
surveillance
study
was
conducted
from
December
1992
to
December
1994
Susceptibility
testing
of
urinary
tract
isolates
of
E
coli
was
performed
using
a
panel
of
antimicrobial
agents
A
case-control
study
was
also
conducted
for
subjects
with
isolates
resistant
to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(T-S)
this
drug
being
used
a
representative
"first-line"
agent
A
total
of
1636
consecutive
isolates
were
obtained
from
967
subjects
Of
the
1636
isolates
736
(450%)
were
resistant
to
ampicillin
514
(314%)
were
resistant
to
T-S
363
(222%)
were
resistant
to
both
ampicillin
and
T-S
and
27
(17%)
were
resistant
to
both
ampicillin
and
gentamicin
In
the
case-control
study
274
children
with
isolates
resistant
to
T-S
were
matched
with
274
children
who
had
T-S-sensitive
isolates
obtained
during
the
study
period
or
the
preceding
or
subsequent
6
months
Multivariate
analyses
indicated
that
subjects
who
had
received
antimicrobials
for
more
than
4
weeks
in
the
previous
6
months
were
about
23
times
more
likely
to
have
isolates
resistant
to
T-S
than
were
subjects
without
this
risk
factor
(odds
ratio
[OR]
234
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
120-476)
Children
with
genitourinary
tract
abnormalities
were
24
times
more
likely
to
have
resistant
isolates
than
those
without
such
abnormalities
(95%
CI
12-45)
Compared
with
children
who
had
no
hospital
admissions
in
the
previous
year
those
with
1
admission
in
that
period
were
more
likely
to
have
resistant
isolates
(OR
23
95%
CI
14-75)
as
were
those
with
2
or
more
admissions
in
that
period
(OR
32
95%
CI
11-48)
Compared
with
children
aged
2-6
years
children
under
2
years
of
age
were
less
likely
to
have
resistant
isolates
(OR
03
95%
CI
02-08)
Selective
antimicrobial
pressure
and
multiple
admissions
to
hospital
were
among
the
risk
factors
associated
with
antimicrobial
resistance
The
finding
of
a
low
but
definite
level
of
resistance
to
both
ampicillin
and
gentamicin
is
important
for
the
selection
of
empiric
therapy
for
sepsis
in
neonates
The
role
of
inexpensive
first-line
agents
in
the
outpatient
treatment
and
prevention
of
urinary
tract
infections
requires
re-examination
particularly
in
children
who
have
recently
received
antimicrobial
therapy
