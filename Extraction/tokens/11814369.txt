A
systematic
review
of
nonpharmacological
and
nonsurgical
therapies
for
gastroesophageal
reflux
in
infants
Abstract
Text
Nonpharmacological
and
nonsurgical
measures
are
often
recommended
for
gastroesophageal
reflux
disease
(GERD)
in
infants
despite
ambiguous
supporting
evidence
To
conduct
a
systematic
review
of
rigorously
evaluated
nonpharmacological
and
nonsurgical
therapies
for
GERD
in
infants
We
searched
online
bibliographic
databases
including
MEDLINE
EMBASE
the
Cochrane
Collaboration
and
Clinical
Trials
Database
and
alternative
medicine
databases
for
the
terms
gastroesophageal
reflux
and
infants
We
selected
randomized
controlled
trials
of
nonpharmacological
and
nonsurgical
GERD
therapies
in
otherwise
healthy
infants
Data
were
extracted
from
the
selected
articles
regarding
reflux
emetic
episodes
and
intraesophageal
pH
We
identified
43
relevant
studies
of
which
10
met
the
selection
criteria
These
studies
examined
positioning
pacifier
use
and
feeding
changes
Positioning
at
a
60
degree
elevation
in
an
infant
seat
was
found
to
increase
reflux
compared
with
the
prone
position
No
significant
difference
was
shown
between
the
flat
and
head-elevated
prone
positions
The
impact
of
pacifier
use
on
reflux
frequency
was
equivocal
and
dependent
on
infant
position
The
protein
content
of
formula
was
not
found
to
affect
reflux
Although
no
study
demonstrated
a
significant
reflux-reducing
benefit
of
thickened
infant
foods
compared
with
placebo
1
study
detected
a
significant
benefit
of
formula
thickened
with
carob
bean
gum
compared
with
rice
flour
(pH<4
for
5%
vs
8%
of
time)
Another
study
showed
that
if
supplementing
with
dextrose
5%
water
or
dextrose
10%
water
the
lower-osmolality
fluid
was
associated
with
less
reflux
Many
conservative
measures
commonly
used
to
treat
GERD
in
infants
have
no
proven
efficacy
Although
thickened
formulas
do
not
appear
to
reduce
measurable
reflux
they
may
reduce
vomiting
Further
studies
with
clinical
outcomes
are
needed
to
answer
questions
about
efficacy
definitively
