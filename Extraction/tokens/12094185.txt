Diuretic
resistance
predicts
mortality
in
patients
with
advanced
heart
failure
Abstract
Text
In
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
(CHF)
diuretic
requirements
increase
as
the
disease
progresses
Because
diuretic
resistance
can
be
overcome
with
escalating
doses
the
evaluation
of
CHF
severity
and
prognosis
may
be
incomplete
without
considering
the
intensity
of
therapy
The
prognostic
importance
of
diuretic
resistance
(as
evidenced
by
a
high-dose
requirement)
was
retrospectively
evaluated
in
1153
patients
with
advanced
CHF
who
were
enrolled
in
the
Prospective
Randomized
Amlodipine
Survival
Evaluation
(PRAISE)
The
relation
of
loop
diuretic
and
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
doses
(defined
by
their
median
values)
and
other
baseline
characteristics
to
total
and
cause-specific
mortality
was
determined
by
proportion
hazards
regression
High
diuretic
doses
were
independently
associated
with
mortality
sudden
death
and
pump
failure
death
(adjusted
hazard
ratios
[HRs]
137
[P
=004]
139
[P
=042]
and
151
[P
=034]
respectively)
Use
of
metolazone
was
an
independent
predictor
of
total
mortality
(adjusted
HR
=
137
P
=016)
but
not
of
cause-specific
mortality
Low
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
dose
was
an
independent
predictor
of
pump
failure
death
(adjusted
HR
=
221
P
=0005)
Unadjusted
mortality
risks
of
congestion
and
its
treatment
were
additive
and
comparable
to
those
of
established
risk
factors
The
independent
association
of
high
diuretic
doses
with
mortality
suggests
that
diuretic
resistance
should
be
considered
an
indicator
of
prognosis
in
patients
with
chronic
CHF
These
retrospective
observations
do
not
establish
harm
or
rule
out
a
long-term
benefit
of
diuretics
in
CHF
because
selection
bias
may
entirely
explain
the
relation
of
prescribed
therapy
to
death
