Divalproex
sodium
in
migraine
prophylaxis
a
dose-controlled
study
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
divalproex
sodium
(DVPX)
when
used
as
prophylactic
monotherapy
in
patients
with
migraine
Multicenter
double-blind
placebo-controlled
parallel
group
Patients
were
previously
untreated
or
had
failed
no
more
than
two
adequate
trials
of
prophylactic
therapy
During
the
4-week
(single-blind)
baseline
patients
received
placebo
and
completed
a
headache
diary
Patients
with
two
or
more
migraine
attacks
during
the
baseline
were
randomized
to
receive
a
DVPX
daily
dose
of
500
1000
or
1500
mg
or
to
placebo
The
experimental
phase
(EP)
lasted
12
weeks
the
first
4
weeks
for
dose
escalation
to
randomized
dose
and
the
remaining
8
weeks
for
maintenance
at
that
dose
The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
4-week
migraine
attack
frequency
during
the
EP
One-hundred-and-seventy-six
patients
(44
placebo
132
DVPX)
were
randomized
171
provided
efficacy
data
and
137
completed
the
study
During
the
EP
after
adjustment
for
differences
in
baseline
migraine
attack
frequencies
mean
reductions
in
the
DVPX
groups
were
17
(500
mg)
20
(1000
mg)
and
17
(1500
mg)
migraine
attacks
per
4
weeks
compared
to
a
mean
reduction
of
05
migraine
attacks
in
the
placebo
group
(p
<
or
=
005
vs
placebo)
Forty-four
to
45%
of
DVPX-treated
patients
compared
to
21%
of
patients
in
the
placebo
group
achieved
>
or
=
50%
reduction
in
their
migraine
attack
frequencies
(p
<
or
=
005
vs
placebo)
The
recommended
initial
dose
of
DVPX
in
migraine
prophylaxis
is
500
mg
per
day
although
some
patients
may
benefit
from
higher
doses
Adverse
events
were
similar
in
the
DVPX
and
placebo
treatment
groups
except
for
nausea
dizziness
and
tremor
in
which
incidence
rates
were
significantly
higher
in
the
DVPX
1500
mg
group
(nausea
was
also
higher
in
500
mg
group)
than
in
the
placebo
group
Divalproex
sodium
is
an
effective
prophylactic
treatment
in
migraine
and
is
generally
well
tolerated
