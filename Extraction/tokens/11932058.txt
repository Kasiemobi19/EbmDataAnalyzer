Corticosteroid
injections
for
lateral
epicondylitis
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
Patients
with
lateral
epicondylitis
(tennis
elbow)
are
frequently
treated
with
corticosteroid
injections
in
order
to
relieve
pain
and
diminish
disability
The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
corticosteroid
injections
for
lateral
epicondylitis
Randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
were
identified
by
a
highly
sensitive
search
strategy
in
six
databases
in
combination
with
reference
tracking
Two
independent
reviewers
selected
and
assessed
the
methodological
quality
of
RCTs
that
included
patients
with
lateral
epicondylitis
treated
with
corticosteroid
injection(s)
and
reported
at
least
one
clinically
relevant
outcome
measure
Standardised
mean
differences
were
computed
for
continuous
data
and
relative
risks
(RR)
for
dichotomous
data
A
best-evidence
synthesis
was
conducted
weighting
the
studies
with
respect
to
their
internal
validity
statistical
significance
clinical
relevance
and
statistical
power
Thirteen
studies
consisting
of
15
comparisons
were
included
in
the
review
evaluating
the
effects
of
corticosteroid
injections
compared
to
placebo
injection
(n=2)
injection
with
local
anaesthetic
(n=5)
another
conservative
treatment
(n=5)
or
another
corticosteroid
injection
(n=3)
Almost
all
studies
had
poor
internal
validity
scores
For
short-term
outcomes
(<or=6
weeks)
statistically
significant
and
clinically
relevant
differences
were
found
on
pain
global
improvement
and
grip
strength
for
corticosteroid
injection
compared
to
placebo
local
anaesthetic
and
conservative
treatments
For
intermediate
(6
weeks-6
months)
and
long-term
outcomes
(>or=6
months)
no
statistically
significant
or
clinically
relevant
results
in
favour
of
corticosteroid
injections
were
found
Although
the
available
evidence
shows
superior
short-term
effects
of
corticosteroid
injections
for
lateral
epicondylitis
it
is
not
possible
to
draw
firm
conclusions
on
the
effectiveness
of
injections
due
to
the
lack
of
high
quality
studies
No
beneficial
effects
were
found
for
intermediate
or
long-term
follow-up
More
better
designed
conducted
and
reported
RCTs
with
intermediate
and
long-term
follow-up
are
needed
