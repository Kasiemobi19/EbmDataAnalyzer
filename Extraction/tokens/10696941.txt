A
protocol
of
early
spiral
computed
tomography
for
the
detection
of
stones
in
patients
with
renal
colic
has
reduced
the
time
to

and

costs
Abstract
Text
The
recent
use
of
spiral
computed
tomography
(CT)
without
contrast
for
the
diagnosis
of
acute
flank
pain
has
been
shown
to
be
highly
sensitive
and
specific
for
the
detection
of
urolithiasis
This
method
has
not
however
been
evaluated
for
its
contribution
to
savings
in
management
costs
The
present
study
aims
to
evaluate
the
cost
savings
gained
by
instituting
a
protocol
of
early
spiral
CT
to
investigate
these
patients
The
records
of
200
patients
presenting
to
the
Accident
and
Emergency
Department
(A&E)
with
acute
flank
pain
during
two
periods
were
retrospectively
reviewed
The
first
period
was
before
the
spiral
CT
protocol
was
instituted
and
the
second
was
after
Cost
analyses
between
the
two
periods
were
performed
After
the
spiral
CT
protocol
72
versus
31
patients
had
a
definitive
diagnosis
prior
to
discharge
from
hospital
The
time
taken
to
diagnosis
was
also
significantly
shorter
after
the
protocol
implementation
(63
vs
168
h)
This
resulted
in
a
shorter
time
spent
in
the
A&E
and
hence
bed
cost
savings
Radiological
costs
were
reduced
by
22%
but
the
major
cost
saving
was
made
by
a
reduction
in
time
spent
in
A&E
(44%)
The
implementation
of
a
protocol
of
early
spiral
CT
for
patients
with
suspected
renal
colic
has
led
to
earlier
definitive
diagnosis
and
shorter
hospital
stays
This
is
associated
with
a
significant
reduction
in
costs
associated
with
managing
this
condition
