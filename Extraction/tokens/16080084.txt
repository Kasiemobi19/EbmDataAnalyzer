Title
Patient-delivered
partner
treatment
for
male
urethritis
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Traditional
partner
referral
for
sexually
transmitted
diseases
(STDs)
is
ineffective
at
assuring
that
partners
are
treated
Alternative
methods
are
needed
We
sought
to
determine
whether
patient-delivered
partner
treatment
(PDPT)
is
better
than
2
different
methods
of
partner
referral
in
providing
antibiotic
treatment
to
sex
partners
of
men
with
urethritis
and
in
reducing
recurrence
of
Chlamydia
trachomatis
and
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
Men
who
received
a
diagnosis
of
urethritis
at
a
public
STD
clinic
in
New
Orleans
Louisiana
during
the
period
of
December
2001
through
March
2004
were
randomly
assigned
according
to
the
month
of
treatment
for
either
standard
partner
referral
(PR)
booklet-enhanced
partner
referral
(BEPR)
or
PDPT
At
baseline
and
after
1
month
men
were
asked
to
provide
information
about
each
partner
and
were
tested
for
C
trachomatis
and
N
gonorrhoeae
Most
enrolled
index
men
(n
=
977)
were
>
24
years
of
age
(516%)
and
African
American
(95%)
and
had
>
or
=
2
partners
(683%)
They
reported
information
on
1991
partners
and
788%
were
reinterviewed
4-8
weeks
later
Men
in
the
PDPT
arm
were
more
likely
than
men
in
the
BEPR
and
PR
arms
to
report
having
seen
their
partners
having
talked
to
their
partners
about
the
infection
having
given
the
intervention
to
their
partners
and
having
been
told
by
their
partners
that
the
antibiotic
treatment
had
been
taken
(558%
456%
and
350%
respectively
P
<
001)
Of
men
who
were
reinterviewed
375%
agreed
to
follow-up
testing
for
N
gonorrhoeae
and
C
trachomatis
infection
Those
tested
were
similar
to
those
not
tested
with
regard
to
the
study
variables
measured
Among
those
tested
men
in
the
PDPT
and
BEPR
arms
were
less
likely
than
those
in
the
PR
arm
to
test
positive
for
C
trachomatis
and/or
N
gonorrhoeae
(230%
143%
and
427%
respectively
P
<
001)
Among
heterosexual
men
with
urethritis
PDPT
was
better
than
standard
partner
referral
for
treatment
of
partners
and
prevention
of
recurrence
of
C
trachomatis
or
N
gonorrhoeae
infection
