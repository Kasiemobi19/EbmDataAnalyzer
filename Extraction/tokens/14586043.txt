Inhaled

a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD)
is
a
syndrome
of
chronic
progressive
airflow
limitation
which
occurs
as
a
result
of
chronic
inflammation
of
the
airways
and
lung
parenchyma
However
the
role
of
inhaled
corticosteroids
in
the
treatment
of
COPD
is
controversial
We
hypothesised
that
inhaled
corticosteroids
reduce
the
progression
of
airflow
limitation
in
COPD
A
comprehensive
literature
search
was
conducted
and
data
were
analysed
using
random
effects
methodology
The
effect
of
inhaled
steroids
on
annual
change
in
forced
expiratory
volume
in
1
second
(FEV1)
was
determined
for
all
trials
for
trials
with
high
dose
treatment
regimens
and
for
trials
in
subjects
with
moderate
to
severe
airflow
limitation
Data
from
eight
controlled
clinical
trials
of
>
or
=2
years
were
included
(n=3715
subjects)
Meta-analysis
of
all
study
data
revealed
that
inhaled
corticosteroids
reduce
the
rate
of
FEV1
decline
by
77
ml/year
(95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
13
to
142
p=002)
Meta-analysis
of
studies
with
high
dose
regimens
revealed
a
greater
effect
of
99
ml/year
(95%
CI
23
to
175
p=001)
compared
with
the
meta-analysis
of
all
studies
Inhaled
corticosteroid
treatment
for
>
or
=2
years
slows
the
rate
of
lung
function
decline
in
COPD
The
effect
observed
with
high
dose
regimens
is
greater
than
that
with
all
regimens
combined
These
data
suggest
a
potential
role
for
inhaled
corticosteroids
in
modifying
the
long
term
natural
history
of
COPD
