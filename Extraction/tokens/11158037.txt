Longitudinal
effects
of
aging
on
serum
total
and
free
testosterone
levels
in
healthy
men
Baltimore
Longitudinal
Study
of
Aging
Abstract
Text
Many
studies
have
shown
cross-sectional
(and
two
small
studies
longitudinal)
declines
in
total
and/or
free
testosterone
(T)
levels
with
age
in
men
The
extent
to
which
decline
in
T
is
the
result
of
the
aging
process
per
se
as
opposed
to
chronic
illness
medication
use
and
other
age-related
factors
remains
controversial
The
frequency
with
which
aging
leads
to
T
levels
consistent
with
hypogonadism
has
also
not
been
defined
These
issues
bear
on
the
potential
use
of
T
replacement
in
aging
men
because
aging
and
hypogonadism
have
in
common
reduced
bone
and
lean
body
mass
and
muscle
strength
and
increased
total
and
abdominal
fat
We
measured
T
and
sex
hormone-binding
globulin
(SHBG)
by
RIA
in
stored
samples
from
890
men
in
the
Baltimore
Longitudinal
Study
on
Aging
Using
a
mixed-effects
model
we
found
independent
effects
of
age
and
date
of
sampling
to
reduce
T
levels
After
compensating
for
date
effects
which
investigation
suggested
was
artifactual
we
observed
significant
independent
age-invariant
longitudinal
effects
of
age
on
both
T
and
free
T
index
(free
T
index
=
T/SHBG)
with
an
average
change
of
-0124
nmol/Lyr
and
-00049
nmol
T/nmol
SHBGyr
T
but
not
free
T
index
also
decreased
with
increasing
body
mass
index
Use
of
beta-blocking
drugs
was
associated
with
higher
T
and
higher
free
T
index
levels
Using
total
T
criteria
incidence
of
hypogonadal
T
levels
increased
to
about
20%
of
men
over
60
30%
over
70
and
50%
over
80
yr
of
age
and
even
greater
percentages
when
free
T
index
criteria
were
employed
Our
observations
of
health
factor
independent
age-related
longitudinal
decreases
in
T
and
free
T
resulting
in
a
high
frequency
of
hypogonadal
values
suggest
that
further
investigation
of
T
replacement
in
aged
men
perhaps
targeted
to
those
with
the
lowest
serum
T
concentrations
are
justified
