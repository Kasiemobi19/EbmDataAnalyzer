Abstract
Text
We
sought
to
determine
the
duration
of
cognitive
impairment
after
sports
concussion
We
conducted
a
study
with
a
prospective
design
in
which
729
athletes
underwent
preseason
baseline
testing
by
being
administered
a
computerized
neuropsychological
test
battery
followed
by
retesting
at
regular
intervals
after
they
sustained
sports-related
concussions
A
control
group
consisting
of
nonconcussed
athletes
drawn
from
the
same
baseline
population
underwent
testing
at
parallel
intervals
Cognitive
impairment
in
this
primarily
American
Academy
of
Neurology
Grade
II
sample
of
boxing
concussions
was
apparent
on
the
day
of
injury
and
at
1
to
2
days
postinjury
Recovery
of
cognitive
performance
occurred
during
the
3-
to
7-day
interval
Comparison
with
control
subjects
showed
that
absent
or
attenuated
practice
effects
in
addition
to
frank
deterioration
from
baseline
were
indications
of
recent
concussion
The
present
findings
of
recovery
during
the
3-
to
7-day
interval
postinjury
are
consistent
with
the
American
Academy
of
Neurology
Grade
II
return-to-play
practice
parameters
suggesting
a
1-week
time-out
from
participation
in
contact
sports
