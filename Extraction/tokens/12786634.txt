Short-
and
long-term
therapy
for
reflux
oesophagitis
in
the
elderly
a
multi-centre
placebo-controlled
study
with
pantoprazole
Abstract
Text
No
placebo-controlled
clinical
trials
have
yet
been
published
on
the
efficacy
of
therapy
in
older
subjects
with
oesophagitis
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
pantoprazole
in
preventing
the
recurrence
of
oesophagitis
in
elderly
subjects
One
hundred
and
sixty-four
patients
aged
65
years
and
over
with
acute
oesophagitis
were
treated
openly
with
pantoprazole
40
mg
daily
for
8
weeks
Patients
with
documented
healing
of
erosive
oesophagitis
were
then
treated
with
pantoprazole
20
mg
daily
for
6
months
Thereafter
cured
patients
were
randomized
to
receive
pantoprazole
20
mg
daily
or
placebo
for
the
following
6
months
Clinical
evaluations
were
performed
every
2
months
and
endoscopy
was
repeated
after
8
weeks
and
after
6
and
12
months
and/or
whenever
symptoms
suggested
a
relapse
of
oesophagitis
After
8
weeks
the
healing
rates
of
oesophagitis
were
811%
(751-871%)
and
937%
(897-977%)
by
intention-to-treat
and
per
protocol
analyses
respectively
After
6
months
the
corresponding
values
were
82%
(754-885%)
and
924%
(876-972%)
respectively
After
12
months
the
per
protocol
and
intention-to-treat
healing
rates
of
oesophagitis
were
951%
(885-100%)
and
796%
(683-909%)
respectively
in
the
treatment
group
vs
327%
(199-454%)
and
304%
(183-424%)
respectively
in
the
placebo
group
(P
=
00001)
Heartburn
acid
regurgitation
and
chest
pain
were
significantly
associated
with
the
relapse
of
oesophagitis
(P
=
00001)
whereas
hiatus
hernia
Helicobacter
pylori
infection
concomitant
diseases
and
treatments
were
not
In
the
elderly
pantoprazole
was
highly
effective
in
healing
and
reducing
the
relapse
of
oesophagitis
discontinuing
active
treatment
after
6
months
was
associated
with
a
significant
increase
in
the
relapse
rate
