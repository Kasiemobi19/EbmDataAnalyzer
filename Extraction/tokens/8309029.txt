A
comparison
of
the
efficacy
and
toxic
effects
of
sustained-

immediate-release
niacin
in
hypercholesterolemic
patients
Abstract
Text
To
compare
escalating
doses
of
immediate-release
(IR)
and
sustained-release
(SR)
niacin
for
effectiveness
in
reducing
levels
of
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
and
increasing
levels
of
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
and
for
the
occurrence
of
adverse
reactions
especially
hepatotoxicity
Randomized
double-blind
parallel
comparison
of
IR
and
SR
niacin
administered
sequentially
at

and
3000

Fourteen-hour

results
of

tests
a

questionnaire
and
withdrawal
rates
The
SR
niacin
lowered
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
significantly
more
than
IR
niacin
did
at
the
dosage
of
1500
mg/d
and
above
while
IR
niacin
increased
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
significantly
more
than
SR
niacin
did
at
all
dosage
levels
The
reduction
in
triglyceride
levels
was
similar
with
IR
and
SR
niacin
Nine
(39%)
of
the
23
patients
assigned
to
the
IR
dosage
form
withdrew
before
completing
the
3000-mg
daily
dose
the
most
common
reasons
for
withdrawal
were
vasodilatory
symptoms
fatigue
and
acanthosis
nigricans
Eighteen
(78%)
of
the
23
patients
assigned
to
the
SR
dosage
form
withdrew
before
completing
the
3000-mg
daily
dose
the
most
common
reasons
for
withdrawal
were
gastrointestinal
tract
symptoms
fatigue
and
increases
in
levels
of
liver
aminotransferases
often
with
symptoms
of
hepatic
dysfunction
None
of
the
patients
taking
IR
niacin
developed
hepatotoxic
effects
while
12
(52%)
of
the
23
patients
taking
SR
niacin
did
The
SR
form
of
niacin
is
hepatotoxic
and
should
be
restricted
from
use
The
IR
niacin
is
preferred
for
the
management
of
hypercholesterolemia
but
can
also
cause
significant
adverse
effects
and
should
be
given
only
to
patients
who
can
be
carefully
monitored
by
experienced
health
professionals
