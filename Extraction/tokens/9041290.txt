Treatment
of
pyogenic
granuloma
in
children
with
the
flashlamp-pumped
pulsed
dye
laser
Abstract
Text
Pyogenic
granuloma
is
a
common
acquired
vascular
tumor
of
the
skin
in
children
often
ulcerates
or
bleeds
and
is
commonly
localized
to
the
face
The
treatment
of
choice
has
been
surgical
removal
either
by
excision
or
shave
followed
by
electrocautery
The
site
young
age
of
the
patient
and
the
inherent
nature
of
surgical
removal
or
electrocautery
often
make
this
procedure
a
traumatic
experience
Also
surgical
treatment
usually
leads
to
permanent
scarring
Owing
to
the
pulsed
dye
laser's
ability
to
cause
selective
destruction
of
superficial
capillary-sized
cutaneous
blood
vessels
its
ease
of
operation
and
its
lack
of
scarring
we
evaluated
its
use
in
the
treatment
of
pyogenic
granuloma
in
children
Twenty-two
children
with
solitary
pyogenic
granulomas
were
treated
with
a
vascular-specific
(585
nm)
pulsed
(450
microseconds)
dye
laser
using
a
5-mm
spot
size
with
a
laser
energy
of
6
to
7
J/cm2
without
anesthesia
Retreatments
were
administered
every
2
weeks
if
necessary
until
the
lesion
cleared
Posttreatment
care
consisted
of
twice-a-day
application
of
bacitracin
ointment
In
20
patients
(91%)
laser
treatment
was
successful
Five
patients
(25%)
required
one
treatment
for
resolution
eight
patients
(40%)
required
two
treatments
and
six
patients
(30%)
required
three
treatments
for
clearing
One
patient
required
six
treatments
before
the
lesion
resolved
There
was
no
correlation
with
the
duration
or
site
of
the
lesion
with
respect
to
the
number
of
laser
treatments
required
Lesions
in
all
20
children
healed
without
scarring
and
with
excellent
cosmetic
results
In
two
patients
(9%)
laser
treatment
failed
in
that
there
was
no
response
to
the
initial
laser
treatment
on
follow-up
2
weeks
later
Both
had
large
pyogenic
granulomas
(1
cm
and
5
cm
in
diameter
respectively)
which
were
elevated
over
5
cm
above
the
surface
of
the
skin
These
lesions
were
surgically
removed
None
of
the
patients
had
a
recurrence
during
the
follow-up
period
of
6
months
to
3
years
Pulsed
dye
lasers
are
effective
and
safe
for
the
treatment
of
small
pyogenic
granulomas
in
children
and
should
be
considered
a
treatment
option
