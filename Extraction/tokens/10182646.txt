The

a
national
probability

survey
of

office-based
physicians
in
the
United

Sample
data
are
weighted

million
visits
were
made
to
physician
offices
in
the
United
States
an
overall
rate
of
28
visits
per

One

of
the

a
significantly
higher

Of

covered
by
some
form
of
insurance
and
87
percent

were
an
