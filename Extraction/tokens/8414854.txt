and

prevention

Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
relationship
between
breast-feeding
and
the
risk
of
life-threatening
rotavirus
diarrhea
among
Bangladeshi
infants
and
children
younger
than
24
months
of
age
Case-control
study
A
rural
Bangladesh
community
One
hundred
two
cases
with
clinically
severe
rotavirus
diarrhea
detected
in
a
treatment
center-based
surveillance
system
during
1985
and
1986
and
2587
controls
selected
in
three
surveys
of
the
same
community
during
the
same
calendar
interval
Cases
and
controls
were
compared
for
the
frequency
of
antecedent
breast-feeding
patterns
Compared
with
other
feeding
modes
exclusive
breast-feeding
of
infants
was
associated
with
significant
protection
against
severe
rotavirus
diarrhea
(relative
risk
(RR)
=
010
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
=
003
034)
However
during
the
second
year
of
life
the
risk
of
this
outcome
was
higher
in
breast-fed
than
in
non-breast-fed
children
(RR
=
285
95%
CI
=
037
2171)
and
no
overall
protection
was
associated
with
breast-feeding
during
the
first
2
years
of
life
(RR
=
261
95%
CI
=
062
1102)
Although
exclusive
breast-feeding
appeared
to
protect
infants
against
severe
rotavirus
diarrhea
breast-feeding
per
se
conferred
no
overall
protection
during
the
first
2
years
of
life
suggesting
that
breast-feeding
temporarily
postponed
rather
than
prevented
this
outcome
While
not
detracting
from
efforts
to
promote
breast-feeding
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
diarrhea
due
to
nonrotaviral
enteropathogens
our
findings
cast
doubt
on
whether
such
efforts
will
impact
on
the
problem
of
severe
rotavirus
diarrhea
