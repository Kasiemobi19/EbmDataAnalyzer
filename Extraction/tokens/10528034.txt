Title
A
10-year
prospective
study
of
primary
hyperparathyroidism
with
or
without
parathyroid
surgery
Abstract
Text
In
the
United
States
most
patients
with
primary
hyperparathyroidism
have
few
or
no
symptoms
The
need
for
parathyroidectomy
to
treat
all
patients
with
this
disorder
has
therefore
been
questioned
We
studied
the
clinical
course
and
development
of
complications
for
periods
of
up
to
10
years
in
121
patients
with
primary
hyperparathyroidism
101
(83
percent)
of
whom
were
asymptomatic
There
were
30
men
and
91
women
(age
range
20
to
79
years)
During
the
study
61
patients
(50
percent)
underwent
parathyroidectomy
and
60
patients
were
followed
without
surgery
Parathyroidectomy
in
patients
with
or
without
symptoms
led
to
normalization
of
serum
calcium
concentrations
and
a
mean
(+/-SE)
increase
in
lumbar-spine
bone
mineral
density
of
8+/-2
percent
after
1
year
(P=0005)
and
12+/-3
percent
after
10
years
(P=003)
Bone
mineral
density
of
the
femoral
neck
increased
6+/-1
percent
after
1
year
(P=0002)
and
14+/-4
percent
after
10
years
(P=0002)
Bone
mineral
density
of
the
radius
did
not
change
significantly
The
52
asymptomatic
patients
who
did
not
undergo
surgery
had
no
change
in
serum
calcium
concentration
urinary
calcium
excretion
or
bone
mineral
density
However
14
of
these
52
patients
(27
percent)
had
progression
of
disease
defined
as
the
development
of
at
least
one
new
indication
for
parathyroidectomy
All
20
patients
with
symptoms
had
kidney
stones
None
of
the
12
who
underwent
parathyroidectomy
had
recurrent
kidney
stones
whereas
6
of
the
8
patients
who
did
not
undergo
surgery
did
have
a
recurrence
In
patients
with
primary
hyperparathyroidism
parathyroidectomy
results
in
the
normalization
of
biochemical
values
and
increased
bone
mineral
density
Most
asymptomatic
patients
who
did
not
undergo
surgery
did
not
have
progression
of
disease
but
approximately
one
quarter
of
them
did
have
some
progression
