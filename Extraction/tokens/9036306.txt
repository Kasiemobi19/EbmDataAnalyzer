Abstract
Text
The
role
of
cardiac
glycosides
in
treating
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
and
normal
sinus
rhythm
remains
controversial
We
studied
the
effect
of
digoxin
on
mortality
and
hospitalization
in
a
randomized
double-blind
clinical
trial
In
the
main
trial
patients
with
a
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
of
045
or
less
were
randomly
assigned
to
digoxin
(3397
patients)
or
placebo
(3403
patients)
in
addition
to
diuretics
and
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitors
(median
dose
of
digoxin
025
mg
per
day
average
follow-up
37
months)
In
an
ancillary
trial
of
patients
with
ejection
fractions
greater
than
045
492
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
digoxin
and
496
to
placebo
In
the
main
trial
mortality
was
unaffected
There
were
1181
deaths
(348
percent)
with
digoxin
and
1194
deaths
(351
percent)
with
placebo
(risk
ratio
when
digoxin
was
compared
with
placebo
099
95
percent
confidence
interval
091
to
107
P=080)
In
the
digoxin
group
there
was
a
trend
toward
a
decrease
in
the
risk
of
death
attributed
to
worsening
heart
failure
(risk
ratio
088
95
percent
confidence
interval
077
to
101
P=006)
There
were
6
percent
fewer
hospitalizations
overall
in
that
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
and
fewer
patients
were
hospitalized
for
worsening
heart
failure
(268
percent
vs
347
percent
risk
ratio
072
95
percent
confidence
interval
066
to
079
P<0001)
In
the
ancillary
trial
the
findings
regarding
the
primary
combined
outcome
of
death
or
hospitalization
due
to
worsening
heart
failure
were
consistent
with
the
results
of
the
main
trial
Digoxin
did
not
reduce
overall
mortality
but
it
reduced
the
rate
of
hospitalization
both
overall
and
for
worsening
heart
failure
These
findings
define
more
precisely
the
role
of
digoxin
in
the
management
of
chronic
heart
failure
