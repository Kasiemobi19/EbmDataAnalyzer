Clinical
comparative
study
of
azithromycin
versus
erythromycin
in
the
treatment
of
acute
respiratory
tract
infections
in
children
Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
azithromycin
and
erythromycin
in
the
treatment
of
acute
respiratory
tract
infections
in
children
were
compared
in
an
open
multicenter
randomized
trial
A
total
of
151
children
aged
from
2
months
to
14
years
suffering
from
upper
airways
infections
(60)
or
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
(91)
were
randomized
to
be
treated
either
with
azithromycin
10
mg/Kg/day
per
os
once
daily
for
3
or
10
mg/Kg/day
1
and
5
mg/Kg/days
2-5
(77
patients)
or
with
erythromycin
50
mg/Kg/day
thrice
daily
for
at
least
7
days
(74
patients)
The
two
treatment
groups
did
not
significantly
differ
as
to
sex
age
weight
type
and
severity
of
infection
and
infecting
pathogens
Clinical
evaluation
was
performed
prior
to
therapy
on
treatment
days
1
3
5
and
7
and
on
day
10
Microbiological
and
laboratory
assessment
were
carried
out
at
baseline
and
after
the
end
of
therapeutic
course
Chest
X-ray
and
serologic
assays
for
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
infection
were
obtained
in
patients
suspected
to
have
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
At
the
end
of
therapy
clinical
cure
was
achieved
in
73
out
of
77
patients
(948%)
in
the
azithromycin
group
and
in
60/72
evaluable
subjects
(833%)
in
the
erythromycin
group
A
significantly
more
rapid
remission
of
several
illness-related
signs
and
symptoms
was
observed
in
patients
treated
with
azithromycin
A
total
of
75
bacterial
pathogens
were
isolated
at
baseline
microbiological
examination
at
the
end
of
the
therapeutic
course
bacteriological
eradication
was
obtained
in
34/34
cases
(100%)
treated
with
azithromycin
and
in
40/41
children
(975%)
treated
with
erythromycin(ABSTRACT
