Title
A
rapid
protocol
for
the
prevention
of
contrast-induced
renal
dysfunction
the
RAPPID
study
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
designed
to
test
a
rapid
protocol
of
intravenous
acetylcysteine
for
prevention
of
radiocontrast-induced
nephropathy
(RCIN)
Oral
acetylcysteine
(NAC)
may
provide
better
prophylaxis
against
RCIN
than
intravenous
(iv)
hydration
alone
Current
protocols
preclude
prophylaxis
of
same-day
or
emergency
patients
owing
to
the
need
for
prolonged
pretreatment
We
prospectively
randomized
80
patients
with
stable
renal
dysfunction
undergoing
cardiac
catheterization/intervention
to
a
rapid
protocol
of
iv
NAC
(150
mg/kg
in
500
ml
N/saline
over
30
min
immediately
before
contrast
followed
by
50
mg/kg
in
500
ml
N/saline
over
4
h
n
=
41
67
+/-
10
years
90%
men)
or
iv
hydration
(1
ml/kg/h
N/saline
for
12
h
pre-
and
post-contrast
n
=
39
71
+/-
88
years
85%
men)
Radiocontrast-induced
nephropathy
occurred
in
2
of
the
41
patients
in
the
NAC
group
(5%)
and
in
8
of
the
39
patients
in
the
hydration
group
(21%
p
=
0045
relative
risk
028
95%
confidence
interval
008
to
098)
In
the
NAC
group
mean
serum
creatinine
fell
from
185
+/-
059
to
177
+/-
073
and
179
+/-
073
mg/dl
48
h
and
four
days
post-contrast
(p
=
002
and
0023
vs
baseline
respectively)
In
the
hydration
group
serum
creatinine
increased
from
175
+/-
041
to
181
+/-
06
48
h
and
180
+/-
050
mg/dl
four
days
post-contrast
(p
=
099
and
023
respectively)
NAC
infusion
was
ceased
after
the
bolus
in
three
patients
(7%)
due
to
flushing
itching
or
a
transient
rash
Administration
of
iv
NAC
should
be
considered
in
all
patients
at
risk
of
RCIN
before
contrast
exposure
when
time
constraints
preclude
adequate
oral
prophylaxis
provided
the
patient
is
able
to
tolerate
this
degree
of
volume
loading
