Prevalence
and
clinical
spectrum
of
gastroesophageal
reflux
a
population-based
study
in
Olmsted
County
Minnesota
Abstract
Text
Gastroesophageal
reflux
is
considered
a
common
condition
but
detailed
population-based
data
on
reflux
in
the
United
States
are
lacking
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
prevalence
and
clinical
spectrum
of
gastroesophageal
reflux
in
Olmsted
County
Minnesota
A
reliable
and
valid
self-report
questionnaire
was
mailed
to
an
age-
and
sex-stratified
random
sample
of
2200
Olmsted
County
residents
aged
25-74
years
The
prevalence
per
100
of
heartburn
and/or
acid
regurgitation
experienced
at
least
weekly
was
198
(95%
confidence
interval
[95%
CI]
177-219)
Heartburn
and
acid
regurgitation
were
associated
with
noncardiac
chest
pain
(odds
ratio
[OR]
42
95%
CI
29-60)
dysphagia
(OR
47
95%
CI
29-74)
dyspepsia
(OR
31
95%
CI
19-50)
and
globus
sensation
(OR
19
95%
CI
10-36)
but
not
with
asthma
hoarseness
bronchitis
or
a
history
of
pneumonia
Among
subjects
with
reflux
symptoms
10%
reported
an
episode
of
hematemesis
and
13%
had
a
past
esophageal
dilatation
Symptoms
of
reflux
are
common
among
white
men
and
women
who
are
25-74
years
of
age
Heartburn
and
acid
regurgitation
are
significantly
associated
with
chest
pain
dysphagia
dyspepsia
and
globus
sensation
The
percentage
of
patients
reporting
complications
is
low
but
the
absolute
number
is
probably
considerable
given
the
high
prevalence
of
the
condition
in
the
community
