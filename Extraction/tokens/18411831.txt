Correlates
of
household

in
low-income

children
with
and

asthma
Abstract
Text
Exposure
to
secondhand
smoke
(SHS)
harms
all
children's
health
especially
children
with
asthma
Yet
children
with
asthma
are
as
likely
to
live
with
smokers
as
healthy
children
Household
smoking
bans
are
being
advocated
to
reduce
children's
harm
from
SHS
To
measure
the
effect
of
household
smoking
bans
on
child
SHS
exposure
and
to
examine
correlates
of
strict
smoking
bans
in
a
low-income
diverse
sample
91
children
with
asthma
were
matched
to
91
healthy
children
All
had
at
least
one
smoker
living
in
their
homes
Nicotine
dosimeters
child
cotinine
assays
and
maternal
reports
quantified
child
SHS
exposures
Maternal
reports
of
household
smoking
rules
behaviors
and
beliefs
and
other
family
characteristics
were
also
gathered
The
presence
of
a
strict
household
smoking
ban
vastly
reduced
children's
SHS
exposures
and
was
associated
with
fewer
cigarettes
smoked
by
the
mother
and
by
other
family
members
the
belief
that
SHS
was
a
personal
health
risk
having
children
with
asthma
and
living
in
a
single-family
home
Many
children
are
exposed
to
high
levels
of
SHS
at
home
Strict
household
smoking
bans
greatly
decrease
but
do
not
eliminate
children's
SHS
exposure
Even
in
disadvantaged
families
mutable
factors
were
associated
with
strict
smoking
bans
Increased
dissemination
and
use
of
established
public
health
strategies
are
needed
to
reduce
children's
SHS
exposures
