Abstract
Text
In
the
Expanded
Clinical
Evaluation
of
Lovastatin
(EXCEL)
Study
a
multicenter
double-blind
diet-
and
placebo-controlled
trial
we
evaluated
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
lovastatin
in
8245
patients
with
moderate
hypercholesterolemia
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
placebo
or
lovastatin
at
a
dosage
of
20
mg
once
daily
40
mg
once
daily
20
mg
twice
daily
or
40
mg
twice
daily
for
48
weeks
Lovastatin
produced
sustained
dose-related
(P
less
than
001)
changes
as
follows
(for
dosages
of
20
to
80
mg/d)
decreased
low-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol
level
(24%
to
40%)
increased
high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol
level
(66%
to
95%)
decreased
total
cholesterol
level
(17%
to
29%)
and
decreased
triglyceride
level
(10%
to
19%)
The
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program's
low-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol
level
goal
of
less
than
414
mmol/L
(160
mg/dL)
was
achieved
by
80%
to
96%
of
patients
while
the
less
than
336
mmol/L
(130
mg/dL)
goal
was
achieved
by
38%
to
83%
of
patients
The
difference
between
lovastatin
and
placebo
in
the
incidence
of
clinical
adverse
experiences
requiring
discontinuation
was
small
ranging
from
12%
at
20
mg
twice
daily
to
19%
at
80
mg/d
Successive
transaminase
level
elevations
greater
than
three
times
the
upper
limit
of
normal
were
observed
in
01%
of
patients
receiving
placebo
and
20
mg/d
of
lovastatin
increasing
to
09%
in
those
receiving
40
mg/d
and
15%
in
those
receiving
80
mg/d
of
lovastatin
(P
less
than
001
for
trend)
Myopathy
defined
as
muscle
symptoms
with
a
creatine
kinase
elevation
greater
than
10
times
the
upper
limit
of
normal
was
found
in
only
one
patient
(01%)
receiving
40
mg
once
daily
and
four
patients
(02%)
receiving
80
mg/d
of
lovastatin
Thus
lovastatin
when
added
after
an
adequate
trial
of
a
prudent
diet
is
a
highly
effective
and
generally
well-tolerated
treatment
for
patients
with
moderate
hypercholesterolemia
