Title
Bromocriptine/levodopa
combined
versus
levodopa
alone
for
early
Parkinson's
disease
Abstract
Text
Drugs
that
mimic
dopamine
such
as
bromocriptine
were
introduced
as
monotherapy
or
in
a
combination
with
LD
in
the
hope
that
this
approach
would
prevent
or
delay
the
onset
of
motor
complications
in
patients
with
Parkinson's
disease
(PD)
However
hitherto
the
role
of
bromocriptine
(BR)
in
this
issue
has
remained
controversial
The
present
study
is
a
systematic
review
of
all
randomised
controlled
trials
of
bromocriptine/levodopa
(BR/LD)
combination
therapy
compared
with
levodopa
(LD)
monotherapy
in
PD
To
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
BR/LD
combination
therapy
in
delaying
the
onset
of
motor
complications
associated
with
LD
monotherapy
in
patients
with
PD

on

and
reference
lists
of
all
included
studies
were
used
to
identify
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
of
interest
Randomised
trials
were
eligible
for
inclusion
if
they
evaluated
the
efficacy
of
BR/LD
combination
therapy
for
delaying
the
onset
of
motor
complications
compared
to
LD
monotherapy
in
PD
patients
Outcome
measures
that
were
evaluated
included
occurrence
and
severity
of
motor
complications
scores
on
impairment
and
disability
and
the
occurrence
of
side
effects
and
dropouts
To
determine
the
feasibility
of
a
quantitative
systematic
review
two
independent
reviewers
evaluated
the
methodological
quality
of
identified
trials
The
methodological
quality
of
five
trials
showed
important
shortcomings
All
studies
failed
to
adequately
describe
randomisation
procedures
Only
two
were
carried
out
according
to
a
double-blind
design
Differences
between
studies
concerning
the
mean
age
of
the
patients
the
BR
titration
phase
the
maximum
achieved
daily
dose
of
LD
(625-1000
mg)
and
BR
(5-50
mg)
and
the
applied
outcomes
were
found
Our
results
show
no
evidence
of
consistent
differences
concerning
the
occurrence
and
severity
of
motor
complications
scores
of
impairment
and
disability
and
the
occurrence
of
side
effects
between
both
treatment
groups
This
systematic
review
found
no
evidence
in
support
of
early
bromocriptine/levodopa
combination
therapy
as
a
strategy
to
prevent
or
delay
the
onset
of
motor
complications
in
the
treatment
of
PD
