health-care
settings
Abstract
Text
These
recommendations
for
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)
testing
are
intended
for
all
health-care
providers
in
the
public
and
private
sectors
including
those
working
in
hospital
emergency
departments
urgent
care
clinics
inpatient
services
substance
abuse
treatment
clinics
public
health
clinics
community
clinics
correctional
health-care
facilities
and
primary
care
settings
The
recommendations
address
HIV
testing
in
health-care
settings
only
They
do
not
modify
existing
guidelines
concerning
HIV
counseling
testing
and
referral
for
persons
at
high
risk
for
HIV
who
seek
or
receive
HIV
testing
in
nonclinical
settings
(eg
community-based
organizations
outreach
settings
or
mobile
vans)
The
objectives
of
these
recommendations
are
to
increase
HIV
screening
of
patients
including
pregnant
women
in
health-care
settings
foster
earlier
detection
of
HIV
infection
identify
and
counsel
persons
with
unrecognized
HIV
infection
and
link
them
to
clinical
and
prevention
services
and
further
reduce
perinatal
transmission
of
HIV
in
the
United
States
These
revised
recommendations
update
previous
recommendations
for
HIV
testing
in
health-care
settings
and
for
screening
of
pregnant
women
