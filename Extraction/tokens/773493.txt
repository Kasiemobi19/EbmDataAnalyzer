Title
Bran
tablets
and
diverticular
disease
Abstract
Text
Three
treatments
for
patients
with
symptomatic
diverticular
disease
were
compared
in
a
crossover
trial
Neither
a
high-roughage
diet
(HRD)
nor
Normacol
plus
an
antispasmodic
were
as
effective
as
bran
tablets
which
produced
a
significant
increase
in
daily
stool
weight
and
a
decrease
in
the
intestinal
transit
time
An
abnormal
rapid
electrical
rhythm
in
colonic
smooth
muscle
was
found
initially
in
80%
of
the
patients
but
the
incidence
was
reduced
by
each
treatment
after
one
month
it
was
present
in
only
40%
of
patients
after
treatment
with
bran
tablets
Only
bran
significantly
reduced
a
high
percentage
motility
to
within
normal
limits
Bran
proved
to
be
the
most
effective
treatment
not
only
in
improving
the
symptoms
in
patients
with
diverticular
disease
but
also
in
returning
to
normal
the
abnormal
pathophysiological
changes
Bran
tablets
were
both
convenient
and
acceptable
as
well
as
effective
