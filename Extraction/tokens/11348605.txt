Abstract
Text
This
study
presents
the
long-term
safety
data
from
AFCAPS/TexCAPS
the
first
primary
prevention
trial
to
demonstrate
that
men
and
women
with
average
levels
of
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C)
and
below
average
levels
of
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
can
significantly
benefit
from
long-term
treatment
to
lower
LDL-C
lovastatin
20
to
40
mg/day
reduced
the
risk
of
a
first
acute
major
coronary
event
(fatal
or
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
unstable
angina
or
sudden
death)
by
37%
(p
=
000008)
This
double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
trial
in
6605
generally
healthy
middle-aged
and
older
men
and
women
had
prespecified
end
point
and
cancer
analyses
All
analyses
were
intention-to-treat
Safety
monitoring
included
history
physical
examination
and
laboratory
studies
(including
hepatic
transaminases
and
creatine
phosphokinase
[CPK])
All
participants
even
those
who
discontinued
treatment
were
contacted
annually
for
vital
status
cardiovascular
events
and
cancer
history
After
an
average
of
52
years
of
follow-up
there
were
157
deaths
(80
receiving
lovastatin
and
77
receiving
placebo
relative
risk
[RR]
104
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
076
to
142
p
=
082)
of
which
115
were
noncardiovascular
(RR
121
CI
084
to
174
p
=
031)
and
of
these
82
were
due
to
cancer
(RR
141
CI
091
to
219
p
=
013)
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
treatment
groups
in
overall
cancer
rates
discontinuations
for
noncardiovascular
adverse
experiences
or
clinically
important
elevations
of
hepatic
transaminases
or
CPK
Among
those
who
used
cytochrome
P450
isoform
(CYP3A4)
inhibitors
there
were
no
treatment
group
differences
in
the
frequency
of
clinically
important
muscle-related
adverse
events
Treatment
with
lovastatin
20
to
40
mg
daily
for
primary
prevention
of
coronary
heart
disease
was
well
tolerated
and
reduced
the
risk
of
first
acute
coronary
events
without
increasing
the
risk
of
either
noncardiovascular
mortality
or
cancer
