Traumatic
brain

in

athletes
Abstract
Text
The
potential
seriousness
of
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
(MTBI)
is
increasingly
recognized
however
information
on
the
frequency
of
MTBI
among
high
school
athletes
is
limited
To
identify
the
type
frequency
and
severity
of
MTBI
in
selected
high
school
sports
activities
Observational
cohort
study
Two
hundred
forty-six
certified
athletic
trainers
recorded
injury
and
exposure
data
for
high
school
varsity
athletes
participating
in
boys'
football
wrestling
baseball
and
field
hockey
girls'
volleyball
and
softball
boys'
and
girls'
basketball
and
boys'
and
girls'
soccer
at
235
US
high
schools
during
1
or
more
of
the
1995-1997
academic
years
Rates
of
reported
MTBI
defined
as
a
head-injured
player
who
was
removed
from
participation
and
evaluated
by
an
athletic
trainer
or
physician
prior
to
returning
to
participation
National
incidence
figures
for
MTBI
also
were
estimated
Of
23566
reported
injuries
in
the
10
sports
during
the
3-year
study
period
1219
(55%)
were
MTBIs
Of
the
MTBIs
football
accounted
for
773
(634%)
of
cases
wrestling
128
(105%)
girls'
soccer
76
(62%)
boys'
soccer
69
(57%)
girls'
basketball
63
(52%)
boys'
basketball
51
(42%)
softball
25
(21%)
baseball
15
(12%)
field
hockey
13
(11%)
and
volleyball
6
(05%)
The
injury
rates
per
100
player-seasons
were
366
for
football
158
for
wrestling
114
for
girls'
soccer
104
for
girls'
basketball
092
for
boys'
soccer
075
for
boys'
basketball
046
for
softball
046
for
field
hockey
023
for
baseball
and
014
for
volleyball
The
median
time
lost
from
participation
for
all
MTBIs
was
3
days
There
were
6
cases
of
subdural
hematoma
and
intracranial
injury
reported
in
football
Based
on
these
data
an
estimated
62816
cases
of
MTBI
occur
annually
among
high
school
varsity
athletes
participating
in
these
sports
with
football
accounting
for
about
63%
of
cases
Rates
of
MTBI
vary
among
sports
and
none
of
the
10
popular
high
school
sports
we
studied
is
without
the
occurrence
of
an
MTBI
Continued
involvement
of
high
school
sports
sponsors
researchers
medical
professionals
coaches
and
sports
participants
is
essential
to
help
minimize
the
risk
of
MTBI
