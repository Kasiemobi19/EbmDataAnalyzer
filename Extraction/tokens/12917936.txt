Title
Oral
sumatriptan
for
acute
migraine
Abstract
Text
Migraine
is
a
common
neurovascular
disorder
characterized
by
recurrent
episodes
of
disabling
headache
autonomic
nervous
system
dysfunction
and
in
some
patients
neurological
aura
symptoms
Sumatriptan
is
one
of
a
class
of
selective
serotonin
5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-HT1B/1D)
agonists
(triptans)
thought
to
relieve
migraine
attacks
by
several
mechanisms
including
cranial
vasoconstriction
and
peripheral
and
central
neural
inhibition
To
describe
and
assess
the
evidence
from
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
concerning
the
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
oral
sumatriptan
for
the
treatment
of
a
single
acute
attack
of
migraine
in
adults
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(Cochrane
Library
Issue
4
2001)
MEDLINE
(1966
through
November
2001)
and
reference
lists
of
articles
and
books
We
included
double-blind
RCTs
comparing
oral
sumatriptan
(100
mg
50
mg
25
mg)
with
placebo
no
intervention
other
drug
treatments
behavioral
therapy
or
physical
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
an
acute
attack
of
migraine
in
adults
Trials
comparing
different
doses
of
sumatriptan
or
dosing
regimens
were
also
included
Outcomes
considered
were
2-hour
pain-free
response
headache
relief/headache
intensity
and
functional
disability
headache
recurrence
and
adverse
events
Data
were
abstracted
by
one
reviewer
and
over-read
by
the
other
The
two
reviewers
independently
assessed
trial
quality
Information
on
adverse
events
was
collected
from
trial
reports
Twenty-five
trials
involving
16200
participants
were
included
Methodological
quality
was
generally
good
Sixteen
trials
were
placebo
comparisons
and
showed
that
sumatriptan
in
doses
of
100
mg
(14
trials)
50
mg
(five
trials)
and
25
mg
(three
trials)
provided
significantly
better
pain-free
response
(100
mg
and
25
mg
only)
headache
relief
and
relief
of
disability
at
2
hours
Numbers-needed-to-treat
(NNTs)
for
pain-free
response
at
2
hours
were
51
(39
to
71)
for
the
100-mg
dose
(n
=
2221)
and
75
(27
to
142)
for
the
25-mg
dose
(n
=
131)
there
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
50-mg
dose
and
placebo
for
this
outcome
(n
=
127)
For
headache
relief
at
2
hours
NNTs
were
34
(30
to
40)
32
(24
to
51)
and
34
(23
to
66)
for
sumatriptan
100
mg
(n
=
2940)
50
mg
(n
=
420)
and
25
mg
(n
=
226)
respectively
Precise
estimates
of
the
efficacy
of
the
50-
and
25-mg
doses
relative
to
the
100-mg
dose
could
not
be
obtained
Adverse
events
were
more
common
with
sumatriptan
100
mg
than
with
placebo

RDs
for
the
50-
and

placebo
comparisons
were
not
statistically
significant
Oral
sumatriptan
has
been
shown
to
be
an
effective
drug
for
the
treatment
of
a
single
acute
attack
of
migraine
It
is
well
tolerated
though
minor
adverse
events
were
not
uncommon
in
the
included
trials
Other
triptans
were
generally
similar
in
efficacy
and
adverse
events
Among
non-triptan
drugs
ergotamine
+
caffeine
was
significantly
less
effective
than
sumatriptan
and
other
drugs
have
been
insufficiently
studied
to
draw
firm
conclusions
