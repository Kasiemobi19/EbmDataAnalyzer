Effective
treatment
of
cobalamin
deficiency
with
oral
cobalamin
Abstract
Text
Because
cobalamin
deficiency
is
routinely
treated
with
parenteral
cobalamin
we
investigated
the
efficacy
of
oral
therapy
We
randomly
assigned
38
newly
diagnosed
cobalamin
deficient
patients
to
receive
cyanocobalamin
as
either
1
mg
intramuscularly
on
days
1
3
7
10
14
21
30
60
and
90
or
2
mg
orally
on
a
daily
basis
for
120
days
Therapeutic
effectiveness
was
evaluated
by
measuring
hematologic
and
neurologic
improvement
and
changes
in
serum
levels
of
cobalamin
(normal
200
to
900
pg/mL)
methylmalonic
acid
(normal
73
to
271
nmol/L)
and
homocysteine
(normal
51
to
139
micromol/L)
Five
patients
were
subsequently
found
to
have
folate
deficiency
which
left
18
evaluable
patients
in
the
oral
group
and
15
in
the
parenteral
group
Correction
of
hematologic
and
neurologic
abnormalities
was
prompt
and
indistinguishable
between
the
2
groups
The
mean
pretreatment
values
for
serum
cobalamin
methylmalonic
acid
and
homocysteine
were
respectively
93
pg/mL
3850
nmol/L
and
37
2
micromol/L
in
the
oral
group
and
95
pg/mL
3630
nmol/L
and
400
micromol/L
in
the
parenteral
therapy
group
After
4
months
of
therapy
the
respective
mean
values
were
1005
pg/mL
169
nmol/L
and
106
micromol/L
in
the
oral
group
and
325
pg/mL
265
nmol/L
and
122
micromol/L
in
the
parenteral
group
The
higher
serum
cobalamin
and
lower
serum
methylmalonic
acid
levels
at
4
months
posttreatment
in
the
oral
group
versus
the
parenteral
group
were
significant
with
P
<
0005
and
P
<
05
respectively
In
cobalamin
deficiency
2
mg
of
cyanocobalamin
administered
orally
on
a
daily
basis
was
as
effective
as
1
mg
administered
intramuscularly
on
a
monthly
basis
and
may
be
superior
