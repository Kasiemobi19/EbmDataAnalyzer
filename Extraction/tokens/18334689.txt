Abstract
Text
Behavioral
weight
loss
interventions
achieve
short-term
success
but
re-gain
is
common
To
compare
2
weight
loss
maintenance
interventions
with
a
self-directed
control
group
Two-phase
trial
in
which
1032
overweight
or
obese
adults
(38%
African
American
63%
women)
with
hypertension
dyslipidemia
or
both
who
had
lost
at
least
4
kg
during
a
6-month
weight
loss
program
(phase
1)
were
randomized
to
a
weight-loss
maintenance
intervention
(phase
2)
Enrollment
at
4
academic
centers
occurred
August
2003-July
2004
and
randomization
February-December
2004
Data
collection
was
completed
in
June
2007
After
the
phase
1
weight-loss
program
participants
were
randomized
to
one
of
the
following
groups
for
30
months
monthly
personal
contact
unlimited
access
to
an
interactive
technology-based
intervention
or
self-directed
control
Main
Outcome
Changes
in
weight
from
randomization
Mean
entry
weight
was
967
kg
During
the
initial
6-month
program
mean
weight
loss
was
85
kg
After
randomization
weight
regain
occurred
Participants
in
the
personal-contact
group
regained
less
weight
(40
kg)
than
those
in
the
self-directed
group
(55
kg
mean
difference
at
30
months
-15
kg
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
-24
to
-06
kg
P
=

At
30
months
weight
regain
did
not
differ
between
the
interactive
technology-based
(52
kg)
and
self-directed
groups
(55
kg
mean
difference
-03
kg
95%
CI
-12
to
06
kg
P
=
51)
however
weight
regain
was
lower
in
the
interactive
technology-based
than
in
the
self-directed
group
at
18
months
(mean
difference
-11
kg
95%
CI
-19
to
-04
kg
P
=
003)
and
at
24
months
(mean
difference
-09
kg
95%
CI
-17
to
-002
kg
P
=
04)
At
30
months
the
difference
between
the
personal-contact
and
interactive
technology-based
group
was
-12
kg
(95%
CI
-21
to
-03
P
=
008)
Effects
did
not
differ
significantly
by
sex
race
age
and
body
mass
index
subgroups
Overall
71%
of
study
participants
remained
below
entry
weight
The
majority
of
individuals
who
successfully
completed
an
initial
behavioral
weight
loss
program
maintained
a
weight
below
their
initial
level
Monthly
brief
personal
contact
provided
modest
benefit
in
sustaining
weight
loss
whereas
an
interactive
technology-based
intervention
provided
early
but
transient
benefit
