Sustained-release
bupropion

a

study
Abstract
Text
The
authors
compared
low-dose
sustained-release
bupropion
with
placebo
for
sexual
dysfunction
induced
by
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
Thirty
adults
who
had
received
SSRIs
for
at
least
6
weeks
who
were
euthymic
and
who
had
sexual
dysfunction
as
determined
by
a
total
score
greater
than
19
out
of
a
possible
30
on
the
Arizona
Sexual
Experience
Scale
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
150
mg/day
of
sustained-release
bupropion
or
placebo
at
600
pm
for
3
weeks
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
sustained-release
bupropion
and
placebo
groups
as
measured
by
change
in
Arizona
Sexual
Experiences
Scale
or
Hamilton
Depression
Rating
Scale
scores
or
side
effects
Future
studies
should
compare
higher
doses
of
bupropion
for
treating
sexual
dysfunction
and
should
include
a
greater
number
of
subjects
