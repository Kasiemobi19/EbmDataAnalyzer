The
performance
of
screening
tests
for
ovarian
cancer
results
of
a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
performance
of
currently
available
tests
in
detecting
ovarian
cancer
in
asymptomatic
women
Systematic
review
of
prospective
screening
studies
Twenty-five
studies
were
identified
sixteen
studied
women
at
average
risk
and
nine
studied
women
at
higher
risk
Most
studies
evaluated
only
one
screening
method
were
small
detecting
few
cancers
and
gave
few
follow
up
details
Sensitivity
estimates
are
therefore
imprecise
In
a
typical
larger
study
reported
sensitivity
of
ultrasound
screening
at
one
year
was
around
100%
(95%
CI
54%-100%)
while
the
sensitivity
of
CA125
measurement
followed
by
ultrasound
(multimodal
screening)
was
about
80%
(95%
CI
49%-95%)
False
positive
rates
ranged
between
12%
and
25%
for
grey
scale
ultrasound
between
03%
and
07%
for
ultrasound
with
colour
Doppler
and
between
01%
and
06%
for
multimodal
screening
This
implies
that
in
annual
screening
of
a
population
with
an
incidence
of
40
per
100000
and
if
no
cancers
were
missed
between
25
and
60
women
would
undergo
surgery
for
every
primary
ovarian
cancer
detected
Ultrasound
and
multimodal
screening
can
detect
ovarian
cancer
in
asymptomatic
women
but
there
is
currently
no
evidence
on
whether
screening
improves
outcome
for
women
in
any
risk
group
On-going
randomised
controlled
trials
should
establish
the
magnitude
of
any
benefit
of
screening
The
low
prevalence
of
ovarian
cancer
in
the
population
and
its
rate
of
progression
may
limit
the
potential
cost-effectiveness
of
screening
