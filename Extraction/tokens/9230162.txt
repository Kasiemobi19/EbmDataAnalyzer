Abstract
Text
At
32-month
follow-up
of
older
patients
with
prior
myocardial
infarction
congestive
heart
failure
and
a
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
>
or
=
40%
treated
with
diuretics
plus
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
and
also
with
digoxin
if
atrial
fibrillation
was
present
propranolol
caused
a
35%
significant
reduction
in
total
mortality
and
a
37%
significant
decrease
in
total
mortality
plus
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
compared
with
no
propranolol
At
1-year
follow-up
propranolol
caused
a
significantly
greater
increase
in
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
(6%)
and
a
significantly
greater
reduction
in
left
ventricular
mass
(34
g)
than
did
no
propranolol
(2%
and
20
g
respectively)
