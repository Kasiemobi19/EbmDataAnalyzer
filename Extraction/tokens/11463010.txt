Abstract
Text
In
patients
with
idiopathic
deep
venous
thrombosis
continuing
anticoagulant
therapy
beyond
three
months
is
associated
with
a
reduced
incidence
of
recurrent
thrombosis
during
the
period
of
therapy
Whether
this
benefit
persists
after
anticoagulant
therapy
is
discontinued
is
controversial
Patients
with
a
first
episode
of
idiopathic
proximal
deep
venous
thrombosis
who
had
completed
three
months
of
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
(with
warfarin
in
97
percent
of
the
cases
and
acenocoumarol
in
3
percent)
were
randomly
assigned
to
the
discontinuation
of
oral
anticoagulants
or
to
their
continuation
for
nine
additional
months
The
primary
study
outcome
was
recurrence
of
symptomatic
objectively
confirmed
venous
thromboembolism
during
at
least
two
years
of
follow-up
The
primary
intention-to-treat
analysis
showed
that
of
134
patients
assigned
to
continued
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
21
had
a
recurrence
of
venous
thromboembolism
(157
percent
average
follow-up
378
months)
as
compared
with
21
of
133
patients
assigned
to
the
discontinuation
of
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
(158
percent
average
follow-up
372
months)
resulting
in
a
relative
risk
of
099
(95
percent
confidence
interval
057
to
173)
During
the
initial
nine
months
after
randomization
(after
all
patients
received
three
months
of
therapy)
1
patient
had
a
recurrence
while
receiving
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
(07
percent)
as
compared
with
11
of
the
patients
assigned
to
the
discontinuation
of
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
(83
percent
P=0003)
The
incidence
of
recurrence
after
the
discontinuation
of
treatment
was
51
percent
per
patient-year
in
patients
in
whom
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
was
discontinued
after
3
months
(95
percent
confidence
interval
32
to
75
percent
average
interval
since
discontinuation
372
months)
and
50
percent
per
patient-year
in
patients
who
received
an
additional
9
months
of
oral
anticoagulant
therapy
(95
percent
confidence
interval
31
to
78
percent
average
interval
since
discontinuation
294
months)
None
of
the
recurrences
were
fatal
Four
patients
had
non-fatal
major
bleeding
during
the
extended
period
of
anticoagulant
therapy
(30
percent)
In
patients
with
idiopathic
deep
venous
thrombosis
the
clinical
benefit
associated
with
extending
the
duration
of
anticoagulant
therapy
to
one
year
is
not
maintained
after
the
therapy
is
discontinued
