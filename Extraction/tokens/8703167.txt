Comparison
of
a
trial
of
labor
with
an
elective
second
cesarean
section
Abstract
Text
In
an
attempt
to
reduce
the
rate
of
cesarean
section
obstetricians
now
offer
a
trial
of
labor
to
pregnant
women
who
have
had
a
previous
cesarean
section
Although
a
trial
of
labor
is
usually
successful
and
is
relatively
safe
few
studies
have
directly
addressed
the
maternal
and
perinatal
morbidity
and
mortality
associated
with
this
method
of
delivery
We
performed
a
population-based
longitudinal
study
of
6138
women
in
Nova
Scotia
who
had
previously
undergone
cesarean
section
and
had
delivered
a
singleton
live
infant
in
the
period
from
1986
through
1992
A
total
of
3249
women
elected
a
trial
of
labor
and
2889
women
chose
to
undergo
a
second
cesarean
section
There
were
no
maternal
deaths
The
overall
rate
of
maternal
morbidity
was
81
percent
13
percent
had
major
complications
(a
need
for
hysterectomy
uterine
rupture
or
operative
injury)
and
69
percent
had
minor
complications
(puerperal
fever
a
need
for
blood
transfusion
or
abdominal-wound
infection)
Although
the
overall
rate
of
maternal
complications
did
not
differ
significantly
between
women
who
chose
a
trial
of
labor
and
the
women
who
elected
cesarean
section
(odds
ratio
for
the
trial-of-labor
group
09
95
percent
confidence
interval
08
to
11)
major
complications
were
nearly
twice
as
likely
among
women
undergoing
a
trial
of
labor
(odds
ratio
18
95
percent
confidence
interval
11
to
30)
Apgar
scores
admission
to
the
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
and
perinatal
mortality
were
similar
among
the
infants
whose
mothers
had
a
trial
of
labor
and
those
whose
mothers
underwent
elective
cesarean
section
Among
pregnant
women
who
have
had
a
cesarean
section
major
maternal
complications
are
almost
twice
as
likely
among
those
whose
deliveries
are
managed
with
a
trial
of
labor
as
among
those
who
undergo
an
elective
second
cesarean
section
