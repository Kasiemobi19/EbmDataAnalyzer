High
fat
and
alcohol
intakes
are
risk
factors
of
postmenopausal
breast
cancer
a
prospective
study
from
the
Malm√∂
diet
and
cancer
cohort
Abstract
Text
Associations
between
intakes
of
relative
fat
total
alcohol
and
alcoholic
beverages
and
risk
of
breast
cancer
were
examined
in
a
subsample
of
11726
postmenopausal
women
from
the
MDC
cohort
The
MDC
conducted
baseline
examinations
from
1991
to
1996
the
end
of
follow-up
was
31
December
2001
Data
were
obtained
by
an
interview-based
diet
history
method
a
structured
questionnaire
anthropometric
measurements
and
national
and
regional
cancer
registries
During
89602
person-years
of
follow-up
342
incident
cases
were
documented
Cox
regression
analysis
examined
breast
cancer
risks
adjusted
for
potential
confounders
Two
energy-adjustment
approaches
(ie
adjusting
for
total
energy
vs
adjusting
for
nonalcohol
energy)
were
used
High
total
alcohol
intake
was
associated
with
a
nonsignificantly
elevated
risk
High
wine
intake
was
associated
with
a
significantly
elevated
breast
cancer
risk
(relative
risk
=
212
95%
CI
124-360)
There
were
significant
trends
of
increased
breast
cancer
risk
across
quintiles
of
relative
fat
intake
Mutual
adjustment
did
not
affect
risk
estimates
for
total
alcohol
or
relative
fat
intakes
The
specific
energy-adjustment
approach
did
not
influence
associations
differentially
