Oral
griseofulvin
remains
the
treatment
of
choice
for
tinea
capitis
in
children
Abstract
Text
Tinea
capitis
is
one
of
the
most
common
infections
of
children
The
standard
treatment
is
griseofulvin
Itraconazole
and
terbinafine
have
in
large
part
replaced
griseofulvin
in
the
treatment
of
onychomycosis
and
in
addition
to
fluconazole
and
ketoconazole
are
evolving
treatments
for
tinea
capitis
The
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
compare
the
efficacy
safety
and
cost
of
oral
antifungal
agents
for
tinea
capitis
Small
open-label
studies
of
itraconazole
terbinafine
and
fluconazole
have
reported
encouraging
results
suggesting
that
these
drugs
may
be
effective
alternatives
to
griseofulvin
however
in
large
controlled
studies
griseofulvin
continues
to
exhibit
greater
or
equal
efficacy
Ketoconazole
appears
to
be
the
least
efficacious
All
five
drugs
appear
relatively
safe
however
only
griseofulvin
has
a
long
track
record
of
safety
is
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
approved
for
the
treatment
of
tinea
capitis
in
children
and
has
the
least
known
drug
interactions
Fluconazole
is
FDA
approved
for
use
in
children
more
than
6
months
of
age
yet
not
for
the
treatment
of
tinea
capitis
Oral
griseofulvin
and
terbinafine
tablets
are
the
least
expensive
of
the
antifungal
agents
griseofulvin
suspension
is
however
more
expensive
than
fluconazole
suspension
For
the
combined
reasons
of
efficacy
safety
and
cost
and
a
long
track
record
of
use
we
feel
oral
griseofulvin
is
still
the
present
treatment
of
choice
for
tinea
capitis
Newer
antifungals
are
currently
under
investigation
and
their
role
in
treating
tinea
capitis
in
children
is
still
being
defined
