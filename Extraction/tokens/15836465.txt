Title
Rapid
growth
in
infancy
and
childhood
and
obesity
in
later
life--a
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
The
association
between
obesity
and
morbidity
resulting
from
chronic
diseases
is
well
known
This
systematic
review
addresses
studies
of
the
role
of
rapid
growth
in
infancy
and
childhood
as
possible
determinants
of
overweight
and
obesity
later
in
the
life
course
We
reviewed
MEDLINE
for
studies
reporting
on
growth
in
infancy
and
childhood
as
well
as
measures
of
weight
or
adiposity
in
later
childhood
adolescence
or
adulthood
The
methodological
quality
of
the
papers
was
assessed
using
the
criteria
suggested
by
Downs
and
Black
Sixteen
articles
that
fulfilled
review
criteria
were
located
There
was
wide
variability
in
the
indicators
used
for
defining
rapid
growth
as
well
as
overweight
or
obesity
The
age
range
in
which
weight
or
adiposity
was
measured
ranged
from
3
to
70
years
In
spite
of
differences
in
definitions
used
13
articles
that
reported
on
early
rapid
growth
found
significant
associations
with
later
overweight
or
adiposity
Efforts
should
be
made
to
standardize
the
definition
of
rapid
growth
as
well
as
that
of
overweight
and
obesity
in
children
and
adolescents
The
most
frequent
definition
for
rapid
growth
in
this
review
was
a
Z-score
change
greater
than
067
in
weight
for
age
between
two
different
ages
in
childhood
Regarding
obesity
the
definition
proposed
by
the
International
Obesity
Task
Force
also
appears
to
be
most
appropriate
The
present
results
indicate
that
early
growth
is
indeed
associated
with
the
prevalence
of
obesity
later
in
the
life
course
