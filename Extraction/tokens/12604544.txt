High-dose
short-duration
early
valacyclovir
therapy
for
episodic
treatment
of
cold
sores
results
of
two
randomized
placebo-controlled
multicenter
studies
Abstract
Text
Oral
valacyclovir
is
better
absorbed
than
oral
acyclovir
increasing
acyclovir
bioavailability
three-
to
fivefold
This
provides
the
opportunity
to
explore
whether
high
systemic
acyclovir
concentrations
are
effective
in
the
treatment
of
cold
sores
(herpes
labialis)
Two
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
studies
were
conducted
Subjects
were
provided
with
2
g
of
valacyclovir
twice
daily
for
1
day
(1-day
treatment)
2
g
of
valacyclovir
twice
daily
for
1
day
and
then
1
g
of
valacyclovir
twice
daily
for
1
day
(2-day
treatment)
or
a
matching
placebo
and
instructed
to
initiate
treatment
upon
the
first
symptoms
of
a
cold
sore
In
study
1
the
median
duration
of
the
episode
(primary
endpoint)
was
reduced
by
10
day
(P
=
0001)
with
1-day
treatment
and
05
days
(P
=
0009)
with
2-day
treatment
compared
to
placebo
Similarly
the
mean
duration
of
the
episode
was
statistically
significantly
reduced
by
11
days
with
1-day
treatment
and
07
days
with
2-day
treatment
compared
to
placebo
The
proportion
of
subjects
in
whom
cold
sore
lesion
development
was
prevented
and/or
blocked
was
increased
by
64%
(P
=
0096)
with
1-day
treatment
and
85%
(P
=
0061)
with
2-day
treatment
compared
to
placebo
The
time
to
lesion
healing
and
time
to
cessation
of
pain
and/or
discomfort
were
statistically
significantly
reduced
with
valacyclovir
compared
to
placebo
In
study
2
results
similar
to
those
in
study
1
were
obtained
AEs
were
similar
across
treatment
groups
These
studies
provide
evidence
supporting
a
simple
1-day
valacyclovir
treatment
regimen
for
cold
sores
that
is
safe
and
effective
The
1-day
valacyclovir
regimen
offers
patients
a
unique
and
convenient
dosing
alternative
compared
to
available
topical
therapies
