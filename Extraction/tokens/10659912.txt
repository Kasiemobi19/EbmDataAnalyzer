Title
Risks
and
benefits
of
beta-receptor
blockers
for
pregnancy
hypertension
overview
of
the
randomized
trials
Abstract
Text
Examine
the
benefits/risks
of
beta-blockers
for
pregnancy
hypertension
Meta-analysis
of
relevant
trials
identified
by
comprehensive
literature
review
(1966-97)
Included
were
30
trials
for
pregnancy
hypertension
and
four
others
for
perinatal
outcomes
only
For
mild
chronic
hypertension
treated
throughout
pregnancy
(n=2
trials)
oral
beta-blockers
(compared
with
no
therapy)
were
associated
with
an
inconsistent
increase
in
small
for
gestational
age
(SGA)
infants
(OR
246
[102
592])
For
mild-moderate
'late-onset'
pregnancy
hypertension
(ie
either
chronic
treated
only
late
in
pregnancy
or
pregnancy-induced)
(n=8
trials)
oral
beta-blockers
(compared
with
no
therapy)
were
associated
with
a
decrease
in
severe
hypertension
(OR
027
[016
0451)
borderline
decrease
in
development
of
proteinuria
(OR
069
[048
102])
decrease
in
RDS
(OR
033
[013
085])
but
a
borderline
increase
in
SGA
infants
(OR
147
[096
226])
Beta-blockers
were
equivalent
to
other
agents
(n=15
trials)
For
severe
'late-onset'
pregnancy
hypertension
(n=5
trials)
iv
labetalol
produced
less
maternal
hypotension
(OR
013
[003
071])
and
fewer
cesareans
(OR
023
[013
063])
than
iv
hydralazine/diazoxide
It
is
not
clear
that
the
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
when
beta-blockers
are
used
to
treat
mild
to
moderate
chronic
or
pregnancy-induced
hypertension
given
the
unknown
overall
effect
on
perinatal
outcomes
For
severe
'late-onset'
pregnancy
hypertension
iv
labetalol
is
safer
than
iv
hydralazine
or
diazoxide
