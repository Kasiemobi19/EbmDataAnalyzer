Randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
of
cephalexin
for
treatment
of
uncomplicated
skin
abscesses
in
a
population
at
risk
for
community-acquired
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
infection
Abstract
Text
Empirical
use
of
beta-lactam
antibiotics
the
preferred
agents
for
treating
uncomplicated
skin
and
soft
tissue
infections
may
no
longer
be
appropriate
for
these
infections
because
of
the
increasing
prevalence
of
community
strains
of
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
(MRSA)
Retrospective
studies
however
suggest
that
outcomes
are
good
even
when
beta-lactams
are
used
We
conducted
a
randomized
double-blind
trial
of
166
outpatient
subjects
comparing
placebo
to
cephalexin
at
500
mg
orally
four
times
for
7
days
after
incision
and
drainage
of
skin
and
soft
tissue
abscesses
The
primary
outcome
was
clinical
cure
or
failure
7
days
after
incision
and
drainage
S
aureus
was
isolated
from
704%
of
abscess
cultures
Of
the
isolates
tested
878%
were
MRSA
93%
of
which
were
positive
for
Panton-Valentine
leucocidin
genes
Clinical
cure
rates
were
905%
(95%
confidence
interval
082
to
096)
in
the
84
placebo
recipients
and
841%
(95%
confidence
interval
074
to
091)
in
the
82
cephalexin
recipients
(difference
in
the
two
proportions
00006
95%
confidence
interval
-00461
to
00472
P
=
025)
The
905%
cure
rate
observed
in
the
placebo
arm
and
841%
cure
rate
observed
in
the
cephalexin
arm
provide
strong
evidence
that
antibiotics
may
be
unnecessary
after
surgical
drainage
of
uncomplicated
skin
and
soft
tissue
abscesses
caused
by
community
strains
of
MRSA
