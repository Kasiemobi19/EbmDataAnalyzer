Abstract
Text
To
investigate
why
sharing
the
bed
with
an
infant
is
a
not
consistent
risk
factor
for
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
in
ethnic
subgroups
in
New
Zealand
and
to
see
if
the
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
associated
with
this
practice
is
related
to
other
factors
particularly
maternal
smoking
and
alcohol
consumption
Nationwide
case-control
study
Region
of
New
Zealand
with
78%
of
all
births
during
1987-90
Home
interviews
were
completed
with
parents
of
393
(810%
of
total)
infants
who
died
from
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
in
the
postneonatal
age
group
and
1592
(884%
of
total)
controls
who
were
a
representative
sample
of
all
hospital
births
in
the
study
region
Maternal
smoking
interacted
with
infant
bed
sharing
on
the
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
Compared
with
infants
not
exposed
to
either
risk
factor
the
relative
risk
for
infants
of
mothers
who
smoked
was
394
(95%
confidence
interval
247
to
627)
for
bed
sharing
in
the
last
two
weeks
and
455
(263
to
788)
for
bed
sharing
in
the
last
sleep
after
other
confounders
were
controlled
for
The
results
for
infants
of
non-smoking
mothers
were
inconsistent
with
the
relative
risk
being
significantly
increased
for
usual
bed
sharing
in
the
last
two
weeks
(173
111
to
270)
but
not
for
bed
sharing
in
the
last
sleep
(098
044
to
218)
Neither
maternal
alcohol
consumption
nor
the
thermal
resistance
of
the
infant's
clothing
and
bedding
interacted
with
bed
sharing
to
increase
the
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
and
alcohol
was
not
a
risk
factor
by
itself
Infant
bed
sharing
is
associated
with
a
significantly
raised
risk
of
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
particularly
among
infants
of
mothers
who
smoke
The
interaction
between
maternal
smoking
and
bed
sharing
suggests
that
a
mechanism
involving
passive
smoking
rather
than
the
previously
proposed
mechanisms
of
overlaying
and
hyperthermia
increases
the
risk
of
sudden
infant
death
from
bed
sharing
