Title
Hormone
replacement
therapy
in
postmenopausal
women
endometrial
hyperplasia
and
irregular
bleeding
Abstract
Text
The
decline
in
circulating
oestrogen
around
the
time
of
the
menopause
often
induces
unacceptable
symptoms
that
affect
the
health
and
well
being
of
women
Hormone
replacement
therapy
(both
unopposed
oestrogen
and
oestrogen
and
progestogen
combinations)
is
an
effective
treatment
for
these
symptoms
In
women
with
an
intact
uterus
unopposed
oestrogen
may
induce
endometrial
stimulation
and
increase
the
risk
of
endometrial
hyperplasia
and
carcinoma
The
addition
of
progestogen
reduces
this
risk
but
may
cause
unacceptable
symptoms
bleeding
and
spotting
which
can
affect
adherence
to
therapy
The
objective
of
this
review
is
to
assess
which
hormone
replacement
therapy
regimens
provide
effective
protection
against
the
development
of
endometrial
hyperplasia
and/or
carcinoma
with
a
low
rate
of
abnormal
vaginal
bleeding

were

Attempts
were
also
made
to
identify
trials
from
citation
lists
of
review
articles
and
drug
companies
were
contacted
for
unpublished
data
In
most
cases
the
corresponding
author
of
each
included
trial
was
contacted
for
additional
information
The
inclusion
criteria
were
randomised
comparisons
of
unopposed
oestrogen
therapy
combined
continuous
oestrogen-progestogen
therapy
and
sequential
oestrogen-progestogen
therapy
with
each
other
and
placebo
administered
over
a
minimum
treatment
period
of
six
months
Trials
had
to
assess
which
regimen
was
the
most
protective
against
the
development
of
endometrial
hyperplasia/carcinoma
and/or
caused
the
lowest
rate
of
irregular
bleeding
Twenty
three
RCTs
were
identified
and
five
were
excluded
The
reviewers
assessed
the
eighteen
included
studies
for
quality
extracted
the
data
independently
and
odds
ratios
for
dichotomous
outcomes
were
estimated
Outcomes
analysed
included
frequency
of
endometrial
hyperplasia
or
carcinoma
frequency
of
irregular
bleeding
and
unscheduled
biopsies
or
dilation
and
curettage
and
adherence
to
therapy
Unopposed
moderate
or
high
dose
oestrogen
therapy
was
associated
with
a
significant
increase
in
rates
of
endometrial
hyperplasia
with
increasing
rates
at
longer
duration
of
treatment
and
follow
up
Odds
ratios
ranged
from
54
(1
4-209)
for
6
months
of
treatment
to
160
(93-275)
for
36
months
of
treatment
with
moderate
dose
oestrogen
(in
the
PEPI
trial
62%
of
those
who
took
moderate
dose
oestrogen
had
some
form
of
hyperplasia
at
36
months
compared
to
2%
of
those
who
took
placebo)
Irregular
bleeding
and
non
adherence
to
treatment
were
also
significantly
more
likely
under
these
unopposed
oestrogen
regimens
with
greater
effects
with
higher
dose
therapy
There
was
no
evidence
of
increased
hyperplasia
rates
however
with
low
dose
oestrogen
The
addition
of
progestogens
either
in
continuous
combined
or
sequential
regimens
helped
to
prevent
the
development
of
endometrial
hyperplasia
and
improved
adherence
to
therapy
(odds
ratios
of
37
for
sequential
therapy
and
60
for
continuous
therapy)
Irregular
bleeding
however
was
more
likely
under
a
continuous
than
a
sequential
oestrogen-progestogen
regimen
(OR
=
23
95%
CI
21-25)
but
at
longer
duration
of
treatment
continuous
therapy
was
more
protective
than
sequential
therapy
in
preventing
endometrial
hyperplasia
(OR
=
03
95%
CI
01-097)
There
was
evidence
of
a
higher
incidence
of
hyperplasia
under
long
cycle
sequential
therapy
(progestogen
given
every
3
months)
compared
to
monthly
sequential
therapy
(progestogen
given
every
month)
No
increase
in
endometrial
cancer
was
seen
in
any
of
the
treatment
groups
during
the
limited
duration
(maximum
of
3
years)
of
these
trials
