Title
Behavioural
treatment
for
chronic
low-back
pain
Abstract
Text
Behavioural
treatment
commonly
used
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
low-back
pain
(CLBP)
is
primarily
focused
at
reducing
disability
through
the
modification
of
environmental
contingencies
and
cognitive
processes
In
general
three
behavioural
treatment
approaches
are
distinguished
operant
cognitive
and
respondent
To
determine
if
behavioural
therapy
is
more
effective
than
reference
treatments
for
CLBP
and
which
type
of
behavioural
treatment
is
most
effective
We
searched
the
CENTRAL
MEDLINE
EMBASE
and
PsycLIT
databases
up
to
October
2003
References
of
identified
randomised
trials
and
relevant
systematic
reviews
were
screened
Only
randomised
trials
on
behavioural
treatment
for
non-specific
CLBP
were
included
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
the
methodological
quality
and
extracted
the
data
The
magnitude
of
effect
was
assessed
by
computing
a
pooled
effect
size
for
post-treatment
and
long-term
results
for
each
comparison
for
each
domain
(ie
behavioural
outcomes
overall
improvement
back
pain
specific
and
generic
functional
status
return
to
work
and
pain
intensity)
using
the
random
effects
model
Seven
studies
(33%)
were
considered
high
quality
Comparing
behavioural
treatment
to
waiting
list
control
(WLC)
revealed
strong
evidence
(4
trials
134
people)
in
favour
of
a
combined
respondent-cognitive
therapy
for
a
medium
positive
effect
on
pain
and
moderate
evidence
(2
trials
39
people)
in
favour
of
progressive
relaxation
for
a
large
positive
effect
on
pain
and
behavioural
outcomes
(short-term
only)
When
comparing
operant
treatment
to
WLC
no
significant
differences
could
be
detected
on
general
functional
status
(strong
evidence
2
trials
87
people)
or
on
behavioural
outcomes
(moderate
evidence
3
trials
153
people)
(short-term
only)
There
is
limited
evidence
(1
trial
98
people)
that
a
graded
activity
program
in
an
industrial
setting
is
more
effective
than
usual
care
for
early
return
to
work
and
reduced
long-term
sick
leave
There
is
limited
evidence
(1
trail
39
people)
that
there
are
no
differences
between
behavioural
treatment
and
exercises
Finally
there
is
moderate
evidence
(6
trials
210
people)
that
there
are
no
significant
differences
in
short-term
and
long-term
effectiveness
when
behavioural
components
are
added
to
usual
treatment
programs
for
CLBP
(ie
physiotherapy
back
education)
on
pain
generic
functional
status
and
behavioural
outcomes
Combined
respondent-cognitive
therapy
and
progressive
relaxation
therapy
are
more
effective
than
WLC
on
short-term
pain
relief
However
it
is
unknown
whether
these
results
sustain
in
the
long
term
No
significant
differences
could
be
detected
between
behavioural
treatment
and
exercise
therapy
Whether
clinicians
should
refer
patients
with
CLBP
to
behavioural
treatment
programs
or
to
active
conservative
treatment
cannot
be
concluded
from
this
review
