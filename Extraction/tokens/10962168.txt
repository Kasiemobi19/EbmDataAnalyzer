Factors
predicting
peri-
and
neonatal
outcome
in
diabetic
pregnancy
Abstract
Text
A
population-based
birth
cohort
including
296
consecutive
type
1
diabetic
births
in
a
geographically
defined
catchment
area
was
used
to
evaluate
factors
predicting
poor
perinatal
and
neonatal
outcome
Though
perinatal
mortality
has
decreased
(171/1000
births
at
28
or
more
weeks
of
gestation)
the
neonatal
morbidity
rate
still
remains
high
despite
improved
maternal
metabolic
control
and
developed
antepartum
surveillance
Poor
glycemic
control
during
the
first
weeks
of
pregnancy
was
the
most
important
risk
factor
(relative
risk
(RR)
291
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
129-655)
predicting
adverse
neonatal
events
such
as
long
(>10
days)
stay
in
the
neonatal
unit
malformation
or
perinatal
death
The
risk
was
further
increased
in
cases
of
severe
diabetes
(White
class
F-R
RR
275
95%
CI
159-476)
and
primiparity
(RR
164
95%
CI
102-265)
By
evaluating
these
risk
factors
at
the
first
antenatal
visit
a
subgroup
with
a
particular
need
of
counselling
and
intensive
feto-maternal
monitoring
can
be
identified
