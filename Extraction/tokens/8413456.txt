The
effect
of
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibition
on
diabetic
nephropathy

Group
Abstract
Text
Renal
function
declines
progressively
in
patients
who
have
diabetic
nephropathy
and
the
decline
may
be
slowed
by
antihypertensive
drugs
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
captopril
has
kidney-protecting
properties
independent
of
its
effect
on
blood
pressure
in
diabetic
nephropathy
We
performed
a
randomized
controlled
trial
comparing
captopril
with
placebo
in
patients
with
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
in
whom
urinary
protein
excretion
was
>
or
=
500
mg
per
day
and
the
serum
creatinine
concentration
was
<
or
=
25
mg
per
deciliter
(221
mumol
per
liter)
Blood-pressure
goals
were
defined
to
achieve
control
during
a
median
follow-up
of
three
years
The
primary
end
point
was
a
doubling
of
the
base-line
serum
creatinine
concentration
Two
hundred
seven
patients
received
captopril
and
202
placebo
Serum
creatinine
concentrations
doubled
in
25
patients
in
the
captopril
group
as
compared
with
43
patients
in
the
placebo
group
(P
=
0007)
The
associated
reductions
in
risk
of
a
doubling
of
the
serum
creatinine
concentration
were
48
percent
in
the
captopril
group
as
a
whole
76
percent
in
the
subgroup
with
a
baseline
serum
creatinine
concentration
of
20
mg
per
deciliter
(177
mumol
per
liter)
55
percent
in
the
subgroup
with
a
concentration
of
15
mg
per
deciliter
(133
mumol
per
liter)
and
17
percent
in
the
subgroup
with
a
concentration
of
10
mg
per
deciliter
(884
mumol
per
liter)
The
mean
(+/-
SD)
rate
of
decline
in
creatinine
clearance
was
11
+/-
21
percent
per
year
in
the
captopril
group
and
17
+/-
20
percent
per
year
in
the
placebo
group
(P
=
003)
Among
the
patients
whose
base-line
serum
creatinine
concentration
was
>
or
=
15
mg
per
deciliter
creatinine
clearance
declined
at
a
rate
of
23
+/-
25
percent
per
year
in
the
captopril
group
and
at
a
rate
of
37
+/-
25
percent
per
year
in
the
placebo
group
(P
=
001)
Captopril
treatment
was
associated
with
a
50
percent
reduction
in
the
risk
of
the
combined
end
points
of
death
dialysis
and
transplantation
that
was
independent
of
the
small
disparity
in
blood
pressure
between
the
groups
Captopril
protects
against
deterioration
in
renal
function
in
insulin-dependent
diabetic
nephropathy
and
is
significantly
more
effective
than
blood-pressure
control
alone
