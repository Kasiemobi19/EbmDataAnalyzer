A
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
land
based
therapeutic
exercise
is
beneficial
for
people
with
osteoarthritis
(OA)
of
the
hip
or
knee
in
terms
of
reduced
joint
pain
improved
physical
function
and/or
the
patient's
global
assessment
of
therapeutic
effectiveness
Five
databases
were
searched
for
randomized
clinical
trials
Standardized
mean
differences
(SMD)
with
their
95%
confidence
intervals
(CI)
were
calculated
for
each
study
and
then
combined
using
a
fixed
effects
model
Only
2
studies
totaling
about
100
participants
could
potentially
provide
data
on
people
with
hip
OA
Fourteen
studies
provided
data
on
1633
participants
with
knee
OA
Nine
of
these
studies
were
considered
of
high
methodological
quality
For
pain
combining
the
results
revealed
a
mean
moderate
beneficial
effect
(SMD
046
95%
Cl
035
057)
while
for
self-reported
physical
function
a
mean
small
beneficial
effect
(SMD
033
95%
CI
023
043)
was
found
These
results
appeared
to
be
sensitive
to
blinding
of
outcome
assessor
and
choice
of
control
group
Land
based
therapeutic
exercise
was
shown
to
reduce
pain
and
improve
physical
function
for
people
with
OA
of
the
knee
