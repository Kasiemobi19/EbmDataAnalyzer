Diagnostic
tests
for
renal
artery
stenosis
in
patients
suspected
of
having
renovascular
hypertension
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
To
summarize
and
compare
the
validity
of
computed
tomography
angiography
magnetic
resonance
angiography
ultrasonography
captopril
renal
scintigraphy
and
the
captopril
test
for
diagnosis
of
renal
artery
stenosis
in
patients
suspected
of
having
renovascular
hypertension
For
each
diagnostic
modality
published
studies
were
identified
by
MEDLINE
literature
searches
Original
studies
were
selected
if
they
met
the
following
criteria
1)
suspicion
of
renovascular
hypertension
was
the
indication
for
the
test
2)
intra-arterial
x-ray
angiography
was
used
as
the
gold
standard
3)
a
cutoff
point
for
a
positive
test
result
was
explicitly
defined
and
4)
absolute
numbers
of
true-positive
false-negative
true-negative
and
false-positive
results
were
available
or
could
be
derived
from
the
presented
data
A
standard
form
was
used
to
extract
relevant
data
Data
on
the
accuracy
of
the
different
diagnostic
methods
were
analyzed
and
compared
by
constructing
summary
receiver-operating
characteristic
(ROC)
curves
and
by
computing
areas
under
the
summary
ROC
curves
Although
accuracy
varied
greatly
for
all
diagnostic
modalities
summary
ROC
curves
found
that
computed
tomography
angiography
and
gadolinium-enhanced
three-dimensional
magnetic
resonance
angiography
performed
significantly
better
than
the
other
diagnostic
tests
Computed
tomography
angiography
and
gadolinium-enhanced
three-dimensional
magnetic
resonance
angiography
seem
to
be
preferred
in
patients
referred
for
evaluation
of
renovascular
hypertension
However
because
few
studies
of
these
tests
have
been
published
further
research
is
recommended
