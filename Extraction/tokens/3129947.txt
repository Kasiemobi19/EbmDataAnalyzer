Neuroendocrine-gonadal
axis
in
men
frequent
sampling
of
LH
FSH
and
testosterone
Abstract
Text
Previous
studies
of
episodic
hormone
secretion
of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal
axis
in
normal
men
have
produced
conflicting
results
due
to
examinations
of
small
cohorts
of
subjects
or
to
limited
sampling
techniques
We
evaluated
gonadotropin
and
testosterone
(T)
secretory
patterns
in
20
normal
men
by
sampling
blood
at
10-min
intervals
for
luteinizing
hormone
(LH)
and
follicle-stimulating
hormone
(FSH)
T
concentrations
were
also
analyzed
at
20-min
intervals
in
10
subjects
A
previously
unappreciated
spectrum
of
gonadotropin
and
T
secretory
patterns
was
observed
in
normal
men
Both
mean
LH
concentrations
and
mean
LH
pulse
amplitudes
varied
fourfold
between
individuals
LH
interpulse
intervals
varied
from
30
to
480
min
(mean
119
+/-
32)
Results
also
suggested
a
relative
refractory
period
at
the
level
of
the
hypothalamus
or
pituitary
In
three
subjects
a
striking
nighttime
accentuation
of
LH
pulsations
was
noted
Through
use
of
Fourier
analysis
a
diurnal
variation
in
LH
was
observed
in
the
population
(P
less
than
002)
Mean
FSH
levels
showed
marked
variation
between
individual
subjects
with
discrete
pulses
rarely
observed
No
diurnal
variation
in
FSH
secretion
was
noted
Serum
T
concentrations
determined
at
6-h
intervals
ranged
from
105
to
1316
ng/dl
between
subjects
When
T
was
measured
at
20-min
intervals
marked
intermittent
declines
in
the
T
concentrations
to
levels
well
below
the
normal
range
were
observed
in
3
of
10
subjects
T
secretion
was
found
to
lag
behind
LH
secretion
by
approximately
40
min
(P
less
than
002)
