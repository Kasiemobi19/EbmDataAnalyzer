Hepatotoxicity
associated

isoniazid
preventive
therapy
a

clinic
Abstract
Text
Isoniazid
preventive
therapy
for
latent
tuberculosis
(TB)
infection
has
been
debated
because
of
the
risk
of
hepatotoxicity
The
frequency
of
hepatotoxicity
was
05%
to
20%
in
early
studies
but
may
have
changed
with
new
criteria
for
diagnosis
and
patient
selection
To
determine
the
rate
of
isoniazid
hepatotoxicity
in
patients
managed
according
to
current
guidelines
and
practice
standards
Prospective
cohort
study
A
public
health
clinic
operated
by
the
TB
control
program
of
a
city-county
public
health
agency
A
total
of
11141
consecutive
patients
who
started
a
regimen
of
isoniazid
preventive
therapy
for
latent
TB
infection
from
January
1989
through
December
1995
The
rate
of
developing
symptoms
and
signs
of
hepatotoxicity
among
all
persons
starting
isoniazid
preventive
therapy
among
all
those
completing
therapy
and
by
age
sex
and
race
Eleven
patients
(010%
of
those
starting
and
015%
of
those
completing
treatment)
had
hepatotoxic
reactions
to
isoniazid
during
preventive
treatment
The
rate
of
hepatotoxicity
in
persons
receiving
preventive
therapy
increased
with
increasing
age
(chi2
for
linear
trend
=
522
P=02)
and
there
were
trends
toward
increased
rates
in
women
(odds
ratio
[OR]
330
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
087-1245
chi2
=
328
P=07)
and
in
whites
(OR
260
95%
CI
075-895
chi2
=
308
P=08)
The
rate
of
isoniazid
hepatotoxicity
during
clinically
monitored
preventive
therapy
was
lower
than
has
been
reported
previously
Clinicians
should
have
greater
confidence
in
the
safety
of
isoniazid
preventive
therapy
