Stripping
the
long
saphenous
vein
reduces
the
rate
of
reoperation
for
recurrent
varicose
veins
five-year
results
of
a
randomized
trial
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
possible
long-term
clinical
advantages
of
stripping
the
long
saphenous
vein
during
routine
primary
varicose
vein
surgery
The
study
was
designed
as
a
5-year
clinical
and
duplex
scan
follow-up
examination
of
a
group
of
patients
who
were
randomized
to
stripping
of
the
long
saphenous
vein
during
varicose
vein
surgery
versus
saphenofemoral
ligation
alone
The
study
was
conducted
in
the
vascular
unit
of
a
district
general
hospital
One
hundred
patients
(133
legs)
with
uncomplicated
primary
long
saphenous
varicose
veins
originally
were
randomized
After
invitation
5
years
later
78
patients
(110
legs)
underwent
clinical
review
and
duplex
scan
imaging
Sixty-five
patients
remained
pleased
with
the
results
of
their
surgery
(35
of
39
stripped
vs
30
of
39
ligated
P
=
13)
Reoperation
either
done
or
awaited
for
recurrent
long
saphenous
veins
was
necessary
for
three
of
52
of
the
legs
that
underwent
stripping
versus
12
of
58
ligated
legs
The
relative
risk
was
028
with
a
95%
confidence
interval
of
013
to
059
(P
=
02)
Neovascularization
at
the
saphenofemoral
junction
was
responsible
for
10
of
12
recurrent
veins
that
underwent
reoperation
and
also
was
the
cause
of
recurrent
saphenofemoral
incompetence
in
12
of
52
stripped
veins
versus
30
of
58
ligated
legs
The
relative
risk
was
045
with
a
95%
confidence
interval
of
026
to
078
(P
=
002)
Stripping
reduced
the
risk
of
reoperation
by
two
thirds
after
5
years
and
should
be
routine
for
primary
long
saphenous
varicose
veins
