Title
Immediate
mobilisation
in
acute
vein
thrombosis
reduces
post-thrombotic
syndrome
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
effect
of
compression
and
immediate
ambulation
in
the
acute
stage
of
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
on
the
development
of
postthrombotic
syndrome
(PTS)
Design
follow-up
study
of
patients
who
previously
have
been
enrolled
in
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Setting
outpatient
department
of
a
municipial
hospital
Subjects
and
interventions
a
follow-up
was
performed
2
years
after
53
patients
with
acute
proximal
DVT
had
been
enrolled
into
a
randomized
controlled
trial
comparing
bed
rest
and
no
compression
(n=17)
Unna
boot
bandages
plus
walking
(n=18)
and
compression
stockings
plus
walking
(n=18)
Telephone
interviews
could
be
conducted
with
11
patients
37
patients
could
be
reinvestigated
by
independent
observers
(11
from
the
bed-rest
group
13
from
the
bandage
group
and
13
from
the
stocking
group)
Compression
stockings
up
to
the
time
of
the
follow-up
were
worn
by
8/11
(73%)
of
the
bed-rest
patients
and
by
13/26
(50%)
of
the
mobile
patients
Main
outcome
measures
clinical
and
venous
duplex
investigation
pain
assessment
using
visual
analogue
scale
and
Lowenberg
test
leg
circumference
clinical
''PTS-score''
combining
5
subjective
symptoms
with
6
objective
signs
(Villalta-Prandoni-scale)

Duplex
investigation
of
the
deep
veins
and
pain
assessment
by
visual
analogue
scale
showed
no
significant
differences
between
the
groups
Nine
out
of
11
patients
after
bed
rest
but
only
16/26
in
the
mobile
groups
showed
a
larger
calf
circumference
on
the
diseased
leg
(ns)
Judged
by
the
Villalta-Prandoni-scale
a
significantly
better
outcome
could
be
found
in
the
mobile
group
(mean
score
51)
than
in
the
bed-rest
group
(mean
score
82)
(p<001)
(''Mild
PTS''
=
score
5-14
''severe
PTS''
score
=
or
>
15)
Eighteen
out
of
26
mobile
patients
but
only
2/11
bed-rest
patients
had
a
score
=
or
<
5
(''no
PTS'')
Immediate
mobilisation
with
compression
in
the
acute
stage
of
DVT
reduces
the
incidence
and
the
severity
of
PTS
