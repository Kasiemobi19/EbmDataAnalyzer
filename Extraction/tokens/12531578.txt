Combination
treatment
of
angiotensin-II
receptor
blocker
and
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor
in
non-diabetic
renal
disease
(COOPERATE)
a
randomised
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Present
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor
treatment
fails
to
prevent
progression
of
non-diabetic
renal
disease
We
aimed
to
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
combined
treatment
of
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor
and
angiotensin-II
receptor
blocker
and
monotherapy
of
each
drug
at
its
maximum
dose
in
patients
with
non-diabetic
renal
disease
336
patients
with
non-diabetic
renal
disease
were
enrolled
from
one
renal
outpatient
department
in
Japan
After
screening
and
an
18-week
run-in
period
263
patients
were
randomly
assigned
angiotensin-II
receptor
blocker
(losartan
100
mg
daily)
angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor
(trandolapril
3
mg
daily)
or
a
combination
of
both
drugs
at
equivalent
doses
Survival
analysis
was
done
to
compare
the
effects
of
each
regimen
on
the
combined
primary
endpoint
of
time
to
doubling
of
serum
creatinine
concentration
or
end-stage
renal
disease
Analysis
was
by
intention
to
treat
Seven
patients
discontinued
or
were
otherwise
lost
to
follow-up
Ten
(11%)
of
85
patients
on
combination
treatment
reached
the
combined
primary
endpoint
compared
with
20
(23%)
of
85
on
trandolapril
alone
(hazard
ratio
038
95%
CI
018-063
p=0018)
and
20
(23%)
of
86
on
losartan
alone
(040
017-069
p=0016)
Covariates
affecting
renal
survival
were
combination
treatment
(hazard

rate
(058

use
of
diuretics
(080
030-094
p=0043)
and
antiproteinuric
response
to
trandolapril
(081
021-091
p=0039)
Frequency
of
side-effects
with
combination
treatment
was
the
same
as
with
trandolapril
alone
Combination
treatment
safely
retards
progression
of
non-diabetic
renal
disease
compared
with
monotherapy
However
since
some
patients
reached
the
combined
primary
endpoint
on
combined
treatment
further
strategies
for
complete
management
of
progressive
non-diabetic
renal
disease
need
to
be
researched
