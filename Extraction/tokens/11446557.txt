Title
Treatment
of
painful
osteoporotic
vertebral
fractures
with
percutaneous
vertebroplasty
or
kyphoplasty
Abstract
Text
Vertebral
fracture
is
the
most
common
complication
of
osteoporosis
It
results
in
significant
mortality
and
morbidity
including
prolonged
and
intractable
pain
in
a
minority
of
patients
Vertebroplasty
and
kyphoplasty
procedures
that
involve
percutaneous
injection
of
bone
cement
into
a
collapsed
vertebra
have
recently
been
introduced
for
treatment
of
osteoporotic
patients
who
have
prolonged
pain
(several
weeks
or
longer)
following
vertebral
fracture
To
determine
the
details
of
the
procedures
and
to
gather
information
on
their
safety
and
efficacy
we
performed
a
MEDLINE
search
using
the
terms
'vertebroplasty'
and
'kyphoplasty'
We
reviewed
reports
of
these
procedures
in
patients
with
osteoporosis
We
supplemented
the
articles
found
with
other
papers
known
to
the
authors
and
with
presentations
at
national
meetings
Randomized
trials
of
vertebroplasty
and
kyphoplasty
have
not
been
reported
Case
reports
suggest
that
these
procedures
are
associated
with
pain
relief
in
67%
to
100%
of
cases
Short-term
complications
mainly
the
result
of
extravasation
of
cement
include
increased
pain
and
damage
from
heat
or
pressure
to
the
spinal
cord
or
nerve
roots
Proper
patient
selection
and
good
technique
should
minimize
complications
but
rarely
decompressive
surgery
is
needed
Long-term
benefits
have
not
yet
been
shown
but
potentially
include
prevention
of
recurrent
pain
at
the
treated
level(s)
with
both
procedures
and
with
kyphoplasty
reversal
of
height
loss
and
spinal
deformity
an
improved
level
of
function
and
avoidance
of
chronic
pain
and
restriction
of
internal
organs
Possible
long-term
complications
again
not
fully
evaluated
include
local
acceleration
of
bone
resorption
caused
by
the
treatment
itself
or
by
foreign-body
reaction
at
the
cement-bone
interface
and
increased
risk
of
fracture
in
treated
or
adjacent
vertebrae
through
changes
in
mechanical
forces
Controlled
trials
are
needed
to
determine
both
short-term
and
long-term
safety
and
efficacy
of
vertebroplasty
and
kyphoplasty
Both
procedures
may
be
useful
for
osteoporotic
patients
who
have
prolonged
pain
following
acute
vertebral
fracture
Until
there
is
conclusive
evidence
for
efficacy
and
long-term
safety
these
procedures
should
be
done
only
in
carefully
selected
patients
only
by
experienced
operators
with
appropriate
high-quality
imaging
equipment
and
ideally
at
centers
that
are
participating
in
controlled
trials
