Adiponectin
and
leptin
concentrations
may
aid
in
discriminating
disease
forms
in
children

adolescents

and

Abstract
Text
The
incidence
of
pediatric
type
2
diabetes
has
recently
seen
an
alarming
increase
To
improve
our
understanding
of
pediatric
type
2
diabetes
and
identify
markers
that
discriminate
these
subjects
from
those
with
type
1
diabetes
we
performed
a
multivariant
analysis
associating
serum
adiponectin
and
leptin
levels
with
anthropometrical
parameters
and
disease
state
Samples
from
children
and
adolescents
with
type
1
diabetes
(n
=
41)
and
type
2
diabetes
(n
=
17)
and
from
nondiabetic
individuals
of
similar
age
from
the
general
population
(n
=
43)
were
investigated
An
analysis
included
the
parameters
of
matching
for
BMI
and
Tanner
stage
Receiver-operator
characteristic
(ROC)
curves
were
established
to
assess
these
analytes'
association
with
disease
Contrary
to
studies
of
adult
type
1
diabetes
adiponectin
levels
in
our
pediatric
type
1
diabetic
subjects
(102
microg/ml
[95%
CI
86-117])
did
not
differ
from
those
of
healthy
control
subjects
(106
microg/ml
[92-120]
P
=
NS)
Children
with
type
2
diabetes
(55
microg/ml
[48-62])
had
significantly
lower
adiponectin
levels
than
both
of
those
groups
Conversely
type
2
diabetic
subjects
showed
marked
elevations
in
serum
leptin
concentrations
(243
ng/ml
[171-315])
compared
with
healthy
control
subjects
(27
ng/ml
[13-41]
P
<
0001)
and
type
1
diabetic
subjects
(51
ng/ml
[35-67]
P
<
0001)
Importantly
each
of
the
properties
ascribed
to
pediatric
type
2
diabetes
was
present
when
the
comparison
was
restricted
to
healthy
children
or
type
1
diabetic
patients
whose
BMI
was
>85th
percentile
or
who
had
Tanner
stage
4
and
5
The
evaluation
of
adiponectin-to-leptin
ratios
revealed
a
striking
difference
between
children
with
type
1
diabetes
(63
[38-88])
and
type
2
diabetes
(03
[02-05]
P
<
0001)
In
pediatric
diabetes
where
diagnosis
of
disease
is
often
difficult
these
studies
suggest
that
the
adiponectin-to-leptin
ratio
may
provide
additional
help
in
the
discrimination
between
type
1
and
type
2
diabetes
