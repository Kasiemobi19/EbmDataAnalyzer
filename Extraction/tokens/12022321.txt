A
randomized
controlled
trial
of
muscle
strengthening
versus
flexibility
training
in
fibromyalgia
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effectiveness
of
a
muscle
strengthening
program
compared
to
a
stretching
program
in
women
with
fibromyalgia
(FM)
Sixty-eight
women
with
FM
were
randomly
assigned
to
a
12
week
twice
weekly
exercise
program
consisting
of
either
muscle
strengthening
or
stretching
Outcome
measures
included
muscle
strength
(main
outcome
variable)
flexibility
weight
body
fat
tender
point
count
and
disease
and
symptom
severity
scales
No
statistically
significant
differences
between
groups
were
found
on
independent
t
tests
Paired
t
tests
revealed
twice
the
number
of
significant
improvements
in
the
strengthening
group
compared
to
the
stretching
group
Effect
size
scores
indicated
that
the
magnitude
of
change
was
generally
greater
in
the
strengthening
group
than
the
stretching
group
Patients
with
FM
can
engage
in
a
specially
tailored
muscle
strengthening
program
and
experience
an
improvement
in
overall
disease
activity
without
a
significant
exercise
induced
flare
in
pain
Flexibility
training
alone
also
results
in
overall
improvements
albeit
of
a
lesser
degree
