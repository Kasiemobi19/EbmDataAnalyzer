Risk
of
nonfatal
venous
thromboembolism
in
women
using
a

and
oral
contraceptives
containing
norgestimate
and

Abstract
Text
There
is
concern
that
a
new
transdermal
contraceptive
patch
containing
ethinyl
estradiol
(EE)
and
the
progestin
norelgestromin
increases
the
risk
for
venous
thromboembolism
(VTE)
compared
to
previously
marketed
oral
contraceptives
(OCs)
Quantitative
information
was
obtained
on
the
risk
of
nonfatal
VTE
in
women
using
the
contraceptive
patch
in
comparison
to
women
using
OCs
norgestimate
(either
monophasic
or
triphasic)
and
35
microg
EE
(norgestimate-35)
an
OC
that
has
been
marketed
for
over
a
decade
Nested
case-control
design
based
on
information
from
PharMetrics
a
US-based
company
that
collects
and
organizes
information
on
claims
paid
by
managed
care
plans
The
study
was
nested
among
all
women
aged
15
to
44
who
started
either
the
contraceptive
patch
or
norgestimate-35
after
April
1
2002
Cases
were
women
with
current
use
of
one
of
these
two
study
drugs
and
a
documented
diagnosis
of
VTE
in
the
absence
of
identifiable
clinical
risk
factors
(idiopathic
VTE)
Up
to
four
controls
were
matched
to
each
case
by
age
and
calendar
time
Odds
ratios
(ORs)
comparing
the
risk
of
nonfatal
VTE
in
new
users
of
the
two
contraceptives
and
incidence
rates
of
nonfatal
VTE
for
new
users
of
each
of
the
study
contraceptives
We
identified
68
newly
diagnosed
idiopathic
cases
of
VTE
in
the
study
population
In
the
case-control
analysis
the
OR
comparing
the
contraceptive
patch
to
norgestimate-35
was
09
(95%
CI
05-16)
The
overall
incidence
rate
for
VTE
was
528
per
100000
women-years
(95%
CI
358-749)
among
users
of
the
contraceptive
patch
and
418
per
100000
women-years
among
users
of
norgestimate-35
(95%
CI
294-576)
and
the
age-adjusted
VTE
incidence
rate
ratio
(IRR)
for
current
use
of
the
contraceptive
patch
vs
norgestimate-35
was
11
(95%
CI
07-18)
The
risk
of
nonfatal
VTE
for
the
contraceptive
patch
is
similar
to
the
risk
for
OCs
containing
35
microg
ethinylestradiol
and
norgestimate
