Title
Valacyclovir
for
prevention
of
recurrent
herpes
labialis
2
double-blind
placebo-controlled
studies
Abstract
Text
The
oral
antiviral
valacyclovir
which
is
3
to
5
times
more
bioavailable
than
its
parent
compound
acyclovir
is
a
good
candidate
for
effective
therapy
to
suppress
recurrent
herpes
labialis
lesions
The
efficacy
of
oral
valacyclovir
in
the
suppression
of
herpes
labialis
has
not
previously
been
reported
Two
identical
randomized
double-blind
parallel-group
studies
were
conducted
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
oral
valacyclovir
500
mg
(n=49)
versus
placebo
(n=49)
once
daily
for
16
weeks
in
the
suppression
of
herpes
labialis
among
patients
with
a
history
of
4
or
more
recurrent
lesions
in
the
previous
year
Data
from
the
studies
were
pooled
for
analysis
Twenty-eight
patients
(60%)
in
the
valacyclovir
group
compared
with
only
18
patients
(38%)
in
the
placebo
group
were
recurrence-free
throughout
the
4-month
treatment
period
(P=041)
The
mean
time
to
first
recurrence
was
significantly
longer
with
valacyclovir
(131
weeks)
compared
with
placebo
(96
weeks)
(P=016)
The
total
number
of
recurrences
in
patients
using
valacyclovir
was
24
compared
with
41
in
patients
using
placebo
The
incidence
of
adverse
events
during
the
4-month
treatment
period
was
slightly
lower
in
the
valacyclovir
group
(22
events
33%
of
patients)
compared
with
the
placebo
group
(29
events
39%
of
patients)
The
results
of
these
small
double-blind
placebo-controlled
studies
suggest
that
oral
valacyclovir
500
mg
once
daily
for
4
months
is
effective
and
well
tolerated
for
the
prevention
of
recurrent
herpes
labialis
More
research
with
larger
patient
numbers
is
warranted
to
corroborate
and
extend
these
findings
