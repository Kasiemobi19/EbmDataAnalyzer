Abstract
Text
To
quantify
the
decreased
incidence
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(SIDS)
and
investigate
risk
profile
changes
associated
with
changes
in
infant
sleep
position
A
population-based
case-control
study
that
used
birth
and
death
certificates
from
Washington
State
Cases
(n
=
1515)
were
all
singletons
born
in
Washington
between
1985
and
1995
(excluding
1991)
who
died
of
SIDS
Control
cases
(n
=
6060)
were
randomly
selected
singletons
born
in
the
same
period
who
did
not
die
of
SIDS
Multivariate
logistic
regression
compared
changes
in
the
magnitude
of
associations
between
risk
factors
and
SIDS
before
and
after
1991
The
incidence
of
SIDS
in
Washington
declined
from
26
(1985)
to
10
(1998)
per
1000
births
Over
time
the
risk
of
SIDS
increased
for
low
birth
weight
infants
(odds
ratio
[OR]
21
rose
to
36)
and
infants
born
to
mothers
who
were
smokers
(OR
27
rose
to
37)
unmarried
(OR
14
rose
to
20)
black
(OR
14
rose
to
25)
or
received
limited
prenatal
care
(OR
15
rose
to
25)
Five
exposures
were
associated
with
increased
risks
of
SIDS
These
may
not
require
a
prone
sleep
position
for
their
deleterious
impact
being
associated
with
distinct
causal
pathways
or
possibly
indicating
subpopulations
yet
to
recognize
the
importance
of
the
supine
sleep
position
