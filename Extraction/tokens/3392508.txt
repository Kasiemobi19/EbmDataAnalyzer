Abstract
Text
From
a
consecutive
series
of
3847
headache
patients
1331
patients
who
made
first
visits
for
new
headache
to
120
primary
care
physicians
were
studied
for
usual
care
over
a
14-month
period
Either
tension
or
vascular
headache
was
the
initial
diagnosis
in
238
percent
and
128
percent
of
patients
respectively
Nearly
one
half
(478
percent)
were
classified
as
having
headaches
other
than
tension
or
vascular
A
total
of
153
percent
of
headaches
were
undiagnosed
or
were
regarded
as
a
mixture
of
traditional
diagnostic
designations
At
first
visit
most
patients
(766
percent)
were
managed
without
diagnostic
tests
Drugs
were
prescribed
for
736
percent
and
advice
was
given
for
586
percent
Only
20
percent
of
patients
had
computerized
tomographic
scanning
ordered
at
first
visit
although
at
least
46
percent
met
National
Institutes
of
Health
criteria
a
finding
with
potential
economic
consequences
of
at
least
$2
billion
These
findings
suggest
the
need
for
reevaluation
of
diagnostic
categories
for
headache
reevaluation
of
strategies
for
headache
management
and
further
investigations
of
headache
in
primary
care
patients
