Pravastatin
in
elderly
individuals
at
risk
of
vascular
disease
(PROSPER)
a
randomised
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Although
statins
reduce
coronary
and
cerebrovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
in
middle-aged
individuals
their
efficacy
and
safety
in
elderly
people
is
not
fully
established
Our
aim
was
to
test
the
benefits
of
pravastatin
treatment
in
an
elderly
cohort
of
men
and
women
with
or
at
high
risk
of
developing
cardiovascular
disease
and
stroke
We
did
a
randomised
controlled
trial
in
which
we
assigned
5804
men
(n=2804)
and
women
(n=3000)
aged
70-82
years
with
a
history
of
or
risk
factors
for
vascular
disease
to
pravastatin
(40
mg
per
day
n=2891)
or
placebo
(n=2913)
Baseline
cholesterol
concentrations
ranged
from
40
mmol/L
to
90
mmol/L
Follow-up
was
32
years
on
average
and
our
primary
endpoint
was
a
composite
of
coronary
death
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
and
fatal
or
non-fatal
stroke
Analysis
was
by
intention-to-treat
Pravastatin
lowered
LDL
cholesterol
concentrations
by
34%
and
reduced
the
incidence
of
the
primary
endpoint
to
408
events
compared
with
473
on
placebo
(hazard
ratio
085
95%
CI
074-097
p=0014)
Coronary
heart
disease
death
and
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
risk
was
also
reduced
(081
069-094
p=0006)
Stroke
risk
was
unaffected
(103
081-131
p=08)
but
the
hazard
ratio
for
transient
ischaemic
attack
was
075
(055-100
p=0051)
New
cancer
diagnoses
were
more
frequent
on
pravastatin
than
on
placebo
(125
104-151
p=0020)
However
incorporation
of
this
finding
in
a
meta-analysis
of
all
pravastatin
and
all
statin
trials
showed
no
overall
increase
in
risk
Mortality
from
coronary
disease
fell
by
24%
(p=0043)
in
the
pravastatin
group
Pravastatin
had
no
significant
effect
on
cognitive
function
or
disability
Pravastatin
given
for
3
years
reduced
the
risk
of
coronary
disease
in
elderly
individuals
PROSPER
therefore
extends
to
elderly
individuals
the
treatment
strategy
currently
used
in
middle
aged
people
