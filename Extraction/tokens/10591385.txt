Dietary
sodium
intake
and
subsequent
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
in
overweight
adults
Abstract
Text
Dietary
sodium
is
positively
associated
with
blood
pressure
and
ecological
and
animal
studies
both
have
suggested
that
high
dietary
sodium
intake
increases
stroke
mortality
To
examine
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
associated
with
dietary
sodium
intake
in
overweight
and
nonoverweight
persons
Prospective
cohort
study
The
first
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
Epidemiologic
Follow-up
Study
conducted
in
1982-1984
1986
1987
and
1992
Of
those
aged
25
to
74
years
when
the
survey
was
conducted
in
1971
-1975
(14407
participants)
a
total
of
2688
overweight
and
6797
nonoverweight
persons
were
included
in
the
analysis
Dietary
sodium
and
energy
intake
were
estimated
at
baseline
using
a
single
24-hour
dietary
recall
method
Incidence
and
mortality
data
for
cardiovascular
disease
were
obtained
from
medical
records
and
death
certificates
For
overweight
and
nonoverweight
persons
over
an
average
of
19
years
of
follow-up
the
total
number
of
documented
cases
were
as
follows
680
stroke
events
(210
fatal)
1727
coronary
heart
disease
events
(614
fatal)
895
cardiovascular
disease
deaths
and
2486
deaths
from
all
causes
Among
overweight
persons
with
an
average
energy
intake
of
7452
kJ
a
100
mmol
higher
sodium
intake
was
associated
with
a
32%
increase
(relative
risk
[RR]

[CI]
107-164

in
stroke
incidence

(RR

in
stroke
mortality
44%

(RR

in
coronary
heart
disease
mortality
61%
increase
(RR
161
95%
CI
132-196
P<001)
in
cardiovascular
disease
mortality
and
39%
increase
(RR
139
95%
CI
123-158
P<001)
in
mortality
from
all
causes
Dietary
sodium
intake
was
not
significantly
associated
with
cardiovascular
disease
risk
in
nonoverweight
persons
Our
analysis
indicates
that
high
sodium
intake
is
strongly
and
independently
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
and
all-cause
mortality
in
overweight
persons
