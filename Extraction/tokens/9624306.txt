Predictors
of
occult
pneumococcal
bacteremia
in
young
febrile
children
Abstract
Text
Occult
pneumococcal
bacteremia
(OPB)
occurs
in
25%
to
3%
of
highly
febrile
children
3
to
36
months
of
age
and
10%
to
25%
of
untreated
patients
with
OPB
experience
complications
including
3%
to
6%
in
whom
meningitis
develops
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
identify
predictors
of
OPB
among
a
large
cohort
of
young
febrile
children
treated
as
outpatients
using
multivariable
statistical
methods
We
derived
and
validated
a
logistic
regression
model
for
the
prediction
of
OPB
We
evaluated
6579
outpatients
3
to
36
months
of
age
with
temperatures
of
39
degrees
C
or
higher
who
previously
had
been
enrolled
in
a
study
of
young
febrile
patients
at
risk
of
OPB
in
the
emergency
departments
of
10
hospitals
in
the
United
States
between
1987
and
1991
164
patients
(25%)
had
OPB
We
randomly
selected
two
thirds
of
this
population
for
the
derivation
of
the
model
and
one
third
for
validation
In
the
derivation
set
we
analyzed
the
univariate
relationships
of
six
variables
with
OPB
age
temperature
clinical
score
WBC
count
absolute
neutrophil
count
(ANC)
and
absolute
band
count
(ABC)
All
six
variables
were
then
entered
into
a
logistic
regression
equation
and
those
retaining
statistical
significance
were
considered
to
have
an
independent
association
with
OPB
Patients
with
OPB
were
younger
more
frequently
ill-appearing
and
had
higher
temperatures
WBC
ANC
and
ABC
than
patients
without
bacteremia
Only
three
variables
however
retained
statistically
significant
associations
with
OPB
in
the
multivariate
analysis
ANC
(Adjusted
odds
ratio
[OR]
115
for
each
1000
cells/mm3

temperature
(adjusted
OR
177
for
each
1
degree
C
increase
95%
CI
121
258)
and
age
younger
than
2
years
(adjusted
OR
243
versus
patients
2
to
3
years
old
95%
CI
interval
111
534)
In
the
derivation
set
81%
of
patients
with
ANCs
greater
than
or
equal
to
10000
cell/mm3
had
OPB
(95%
CI
63
101%)
versus
8%
of
patients
with
ANCs
less
than
10000
cells/mm3
(95%
CI
5
12%)
When
tested
on
the
validation
set
the
model
performed
similarly
Independent
predictors
of
OPB
in
children
3
to
36
months
of
age
with
temperatures
of
39
degrees
C
or
higher
treated
as
outpatients
include
ANC
temperature
and
age
younger
than
2
years
These
predictors
may
be
used
to
develop
clinical
strategies
to
limit
laboratory
testing
and
antibiotic
administration
to
those
children
at
greatest
risk
of
OPB
