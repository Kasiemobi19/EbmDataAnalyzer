Abstract
Text
Since
the
American
Heart
Association
last
presented
nutrition
guidelines
for
children
significant
changes
have
occurred
in
the
prevalence
of
cardiovascular
risk
factors
and
nutrition
behaviors
in
children
Overweight
has
increased
whereas
saturated
fat
and
cholesterol
intake
have
decreased
at
least
as
percentage
of
total
caloric
intake
Better
understanding
of
children's
cardiovascular
risk
status
and
current
diet
is
available
from
national
survey
data
New
research
on
the
efficacy
of
diet
intervention
in
children
has
been
published
Also
increasing
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
importance
of
nutrition
early
in
life
including
the
fetal
milieu
This
scientific
statement
summarizes
current
available
information
on
cardiovascular
nutrition
in
children
and
makes
recommendations
for
both
primordial
and
primary
prevention
of
cardiovascular
disease
beginning
at
a
young
age
