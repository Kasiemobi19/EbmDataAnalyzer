Bone
mass

hormone

Abstract
Text
Accelerated
bone
loss
after
stopping
hormone
therapy
(HRT)
is
postulated
to
explain
the
lack
of
hip-fracture
protection
conferred
by
former
HRT
use
The
abbreviation
HRT
(traditionally
standing
for
"hormone
replacement
therapy")
is
used
herein
because
of
its
wide
recognition
in
the
field
However
the
pharmacological
doses
of
estrogens
and
progestins
used
are
not
truly
"replacement"
in
nature
To
determine
whether
women
lose
bone
mineral
density
(BMD)
after
stopping
HRT
to
assess
whether
their
rate
of
loss
is
significantly
greater
than
that
of
women
not
undergoing
HRT
and
to
determine
whether
long-term
HRT
is
associated
with
continued
gains
in
BMD
A
total
of
495
women
who
were
adherent
to
assigned
treatment
in
the
3-year
Postmenopausal
Estrogen/Progestin
Interventions
randomized
controlled
trial
(PEPI-RCT)
and
who
had
an
additional
BMD
measurement
during
the
PEPI
Safety
Follow-up
Study
were
observed
for
an
average
of
3
years
during
and
4
years
after
the
PEPI-RCT
Women
who
stopped
HRT
after
1
year
during
the
PEPI-RCT
had
annual
rates
of
BMD
change
of
-054%
(hip)
and
-081%
(spine)
during
the
following
2
years
Those
who
underwent
HRT
for
3
years
during
the
PEPI-RCT
and
then
discontinued
it
had
annual
changes
of
-101%
(hip)
and
-104%
(spine)
Rates
of
BMD
loss
among
women
who
stopped
HRT
during
or
after
the
PEPI-RCT
did
not
differ
significantly
from
those
of
women
who
did
not
undergo
HRT
who
lost
bone
at
a
rate
of
approximately
1%
yearly
during
the
first
year
of
the
PEPI-RCT
and
about
half
that
rate
afterward
Women
who
continued
HRT
after
the
PEPI-RCT
did
not
show
additional
BMD
gains
Our
results
do
not
support
the
hypothesis
that
bone
is
lost
at
an
unusually
fast
rate
after
discontinuation
of
HRT
nor
do
they
suggest
that
longer-term
HRT
leads
to
additional
BMD
gain
beyond
that
evident
after
3
years
