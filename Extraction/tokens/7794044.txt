Intra-articular
triamcinolone
hexacetonide
in
knee
osteoarthritis
factors
influencing
the
clinical
response
Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
efficacy
of
a
single
intra-articular
injection
of
triamcinolone
hexacetonide
(THA)
in
knee
osteoarthritis
(OA)
and
examine
factors
which
may
relate
to
treatment
efficacy
Eighty
four
patients
with
clinical
and
radiographic
evidence
of
knee
OA
were
recruited
and
randomly
allocated
to
receive
either
THA
(20
mg
in
1
ml)
or
placebo
(09%
normal
saline
1
ml)
Follow
up
assessments
evaluated
the
following
outcome
variables
patient
opinion
of
overall
change
in
the
treated
knee
visual
analogue
pain
score
(VAS)
distance
walked
in
one
minute
(WD)
and
Health
Assessment
Questionnaire
modified
for
lower
limb
function
(HAQ)
Seventy
eight
percent
of
THA
and
49%
of
placebo
treated
patients
reported
overall
improvement
at
week
1
(p
<
005)
At
week
6
improvement
was
reported
in
57%
and
55%
of
patient
groups
respectively
VAS
improved
in
both
groups
at
week
1
(THA
p
<
0001
placebo
p
<
005)
and
week
6
(both
p
<
001)
Improvement
in
VAS
was
significantly
greater
among
THA
treated
patients
at
week
1
only
(p
<
001)
Subgroup
analysis
of
THA
treated
patients
revealed
greater
improvement
in
VAS
among
patients
with
clinical
evidence
of
an
effusion
(p
<
005)
and
those
who
had
synovial
fluid
successfully
aspirated
at
the
time
of
injection
(p
<
001)
WD
improved
in
THA
treated
patients
at
week
1
(p
<
0001)
and
in
both
groups
at
week
6
(THA
p
<
0001
placebo
p
<
001)
Improvements
in
HAQ
were
seen
in
THA
patients
only
at
weeks
1
and
6
(p
<
005)
Regression
analysis
did
not
identify
any
additional
clinical
radiographic
or
synovial
fluid
characteristics
which
influenced
the
response
THA
provided
short
term
pain
relief
in
knee
OA
Increased
benefit
was
associated
with
both
clinical
evidence
of
joint
effusion
and
successful
aspiration
of
synovial
fluid
at
the
time
of
injection
