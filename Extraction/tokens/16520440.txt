Title
Suicidality
in
pediatric
patients
treated
with
antidepressant
drugs
Abstract
Text
There
has
been
concern
that
widely
used
antidepressant
agents
might
be
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
suicidal
ideation
and
behavior
(suicidality)
in
pediatric
patients
To
investigate
the
relationship
between
antidepressant
drugs
and
suicidality
in
pediatric
patients
participating
in
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
Data
were
derived
from
23
trials
conducted
in
9
drug
company-supported
programs
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
antidepressants
in
pediatric
patients
and
1
multicenter
trial
(the
Treatment
for
Adolescents
With
Depression
Study)
that
evaluated
fluoxetine
hydrochloride
All
placebo-controlled
trials
submitted
to
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
were
eligible
for
inclusion
Evaluable
data
were
derived
from
4582
patients
in
24
trials
Sixteen
trials
studied
patients
with
major
depressive
disorder
and
the
remaining
8
studied
obsessive-compulsive
disorder
(n
=
4)
generalized
anxiety
disorder
(n
=
2)
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(n
=
1)
and
social
anxiety
disorder
(n
=
1)
Only
20
trials
were
included
in
the
risk
ratio
analysis
of
suicidality
because
4
trials
had
no
events
in
the
drug
or
placebo
groups
Individual
patient
data
were
available
for
all
the
trials
A
meta-analysis
was
conducted
to
obtain
overall
suicidality
risk
estimates
for
each
drug
individually
for
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
in
depression
trials
as
a
group
and
for
all
evaluable
trials
combined
There
were
no
completed
suicides
in
any
of
these
trials
The
multicenter
trial
was
the
only
individual
trial
to
show
a
statistically
significant
risk
ratio
(462
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
102-2092)
The
overall
risk
ratio
for
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
in
depression
trials
was
166
(95%
CI
102-268)
and
for
all
drugs
across
all
indications
was
195
(95%
CI
128-298)
The
overall
risk
difference
for
all
drugs
across
all
indications
was
002
(95%
CI
001-003)
Use
of
antidepressant
drugs
in
pediatric
patients
is
associated
with
a
modestly
increased
risk
of
suicidality
