Chronic
Achilles
tendon
pain
treated
with
eccentric
calf-muscle
training
Abstract
Text
Injuries
involving
the
Achilles
tendon
and
manifested
as
chronic
tendon
pain
are
common
especially
among
recreational
athletes
In
a
pilot
study
on
a
small
group
of
patients
with
chronic
painful
mid-portion
Achilles
tendinosis
eccentric
calf-muscle
training
was
shown
to
give
good
clinical
results
The
aim
of
this
prospective
study
was
to
investigate
if
the
previously
achieved
good
clinical
results
could
be
reproduced
in
a
larger
group
of
patients
and
also
to
investigate
the
effects
of
eccentric
calf-muscle
training
in
patients
with
chronic
insertional
Achilles
tendon
pain
Seventy-eight
consecutive
patients
having
chronic
painful
Achilles
tendinosis
at
the
mid-portion
(2-6
cm
level)
in
a
total
of
101
tendons
(55
unilateral
and
23
bilateral)
and
thirty
consecutive
patients
with
chronic
insertional
Achilles
tendon
pain
in
31
tendons
(29
unilateral
and
one
bilateral)
were
treated
with
eccentric
calf-muscle
training
for
12
weeks
Most
patients
were
recreational
athletes
Evaluation
of
the
amount
of
tendon
pain
during
activity
was
recorded
on
a
visual
analogue
scale
(VAS)
before
and
after
treatment
In
90
of
the
101
Achilles
tendons
(89%)
with
chronic
painful
mid-portion
Achilles
tendinosis
treatment
was
satisfactory
and
the
patients
were
back
on
their
pre-injury
activity
level
after
the
12-week
training
regimen
In
these
patients
the
amount
of
pain
during
activity
registered
on
the
VAS-scale
(mean+/-SD)
decreased
significantly
from
668+/-194
to
102+/-137
On
the
contrary
in
only
ten
of
the
tendons
(32%)
with
chronic
insertional
Achilles
tendon
pain
was
treatment
satisfactory
with
a
significant
decrease
on
the
VAS-scale
(mean+/-SD)
from
683+/-70
to
133+/-132
Our
conclusion
is
that
treatment
with
eccentric
calf-muscle
training
produced
good
clinical
results
in
patients
with
chronic
painful
mid-portion
Achilles
tendinosis
but
not
in
patients
with
chronic
insertional
Achilles
tendon
pain
