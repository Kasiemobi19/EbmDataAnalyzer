Abstract
Text
To
quantify
the
risk
of
Alzheimer's
disease
in
users
of
all
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
and
users
of
aspirin
and
to
determine
any
influence
of
duration
of
use
Systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
of
observational
studies
published
between
1966
and
October
2002
that
examined
the
role
of
NSAID
use
in
preventing
Alzheimer's
disease
Studies
identified
through
Medline
Embase
International
Pharmaceutical
Abstracts
and
the
Cochrane
Library
Nine
studies
looked
at
all
NSAIDs
in
adults
aged
>
55
years
Six
were
cohort
studies
(total
of
13
211
participants)
and
three
were
case-control
studies
(1443
participants)
The
pooled
relative
risk
of
Alzheimer's
disease
among
users
of
NSAIDs
was
072
(95%
confidence
interval
056
to
094)
The
risk
was
095
(070
to
129)
among
short
term
users
(<
1
month)
and
083
(065
to
106)
and
027
(013
to
058)
among
intermediate
term
(mostly
<
24
months)
and
long
term
(mostly
>
24
months)
users
respectively
The
pooled
relative
risk
in
the
eight
studies
of
aspirin
users
was
087
(070
to
107)
NSAIDs
offer
some
protection
against
the
development
of
Alzheimer's
disease
The
appropriate
dosage
and
duration
of
drug
use
and
the
ratios
of
risk
to
benefit
are
still
unclear
