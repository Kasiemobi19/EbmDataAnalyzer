Risk
factors
for
stroke
and
efficacy
of
antithrombotic
therapy
in
atrial
fibrillation
Analysis
of
pooled
data
from
five
randomized
controlled
trials
Abstract
Text
Atrial
fibrillation
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
ischemic
stroke
Data
on
individual
patients
were
pooled
from
five
recently
completed
randomized
trials
comparing
warfarin
(all
studies)
or
aspirin
(the
Atrial
Fibrillation
Aspirin
Anticoagulation
Study
and
the
Stroke
Prevention
in
Atrial
Fibrillation
Study)
with
control
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
The
purpose
of
the
analysis
was
to
(1)
identify
patient
features
predictive
of
a
high
or
low
risk
of
stroke
(2)
assess
the
efficacy
of
antithrombotic
therapy
in
major
patient
subgroups
(eg
women)
and
(3)
obtain
the
most
precise
estimate
of
the
efficacy
and
risks
of
antithrombotic
therapy
in
atrial
fibrillation
For
the
warfarin-control
comparison
there
were
1889
patient-years
receiving
warfarin
and
1802
in
the
control
group
For
the
aspirin-placebo
comparison
there
were
1132
patient-years
receiving
aspirin
and
1133
receiving
placebo
The
daily
dose
of
aspirin
was
75
mg
in
the
Atrial
Fibrillation
Aspirin
Anticoagulation
Study
and
325
mg
in
the
Stroke
Prevention
in
Atrial
Fibrillation
Study
To
monitor
warfarin
dosage
three
studies
used
prothrombin
time
ratios
and
two
used
international
normalized
ratios
The
lowest
target
intensity
was
a
prothrombin
time
ratio
of
12
to
15
and
the
highest
target
intensity
was
an
international
normalized
ratio
of
28
to
42
The
primary
end
points
were
ischemic
stroke
and
major
hemorrhage
as
assessed
by
each
study
At
the
time
of
randomization
the
mean
age
was
69
years
and
the
mean
blood
pressure
was
142/82
mm
Hg
Forty-six
percent
of
the
patients
had
a
history
of
hypertension
6%
had
a
previous
transient
ischemic
attack
or
stroke
and
14%
had
diabetes
Risk
factors
that
predicted
stroke
on
multivariate
analyses
in
control
patients
were
increasing
age
history
of
hypertension
previous
transient
ischemic
attack
or
stroke
and
diabetes
Patients
younger
than
65
years
who
had
none
of
the
other
predictive
factors
(15%
of
all
patients)
had
an
annual
rate
of
stroke
of
10%
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
03%
to
30%
The
annual
rate
of
stroke
was
45%
for
the
control
group
and
14%
for
the
warfarin
group
(risk
reduction
68%
95%
CI
50%
to
79%)
The
efficacy
of
warfarin
was
consistent
across
all
studies
and
subgroups
of
patients
In
women
warfarin
decreased
the
risk
of
stroke
by
84%
(95%
CI
55%
to
95%)
compared
with
60%
(95%
CI
35%
to
76%)
in
men
The
efficacy
of
aspirin
was
not
as
consistent
The
risk
reduction
with
75
mg
of
aspirin
in
the
Atrial
Fibrillation
Aspirin
Anticoagulation
Study
was
18%
(95%
CI
60%
to
58%)
and
with
325
mg
of
aspirin
in
the
Stroke
Prevention
in
Atrial
Fibrillation
Study
the
risk
reduction
was
44%
(95%
CI
7%
to
66%)
When
both
studies
were
combined
the
risk
reduction
was
36%
(95%
CI
4%
to
57%)
The
annual
rate
of
major
hemorrhage
(intracranial
bleeding
or
a
bleed
requiring
hospitalization
or
2
units
of
blood)
was
10%
for
the
control
group
10%
for
the
aspirin
group
and
13%
for
the
warfarin
group
In
these
five
randomized
trials
warfarin
consistently
decreased
the
risk
of
stroke
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
(a
68%
reduction
in
risk)
with
virtually
no
increase
in
the
frequency
of
major
bleeding
Patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
younger
than
65
years
without
a
history
of
hypertension
previous
stroke
or
transient
ischemic
attack
or
diabetes
were
at
very
low
risk
of
stroke
even
when
not
treated
The
efficacy
of
aspirin
was
less
consistent
Further
studies
are
needed
to
clarify
the
role
of
aspirin
in
atrial
fibrillation
