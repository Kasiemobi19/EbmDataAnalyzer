Abstract
Text
To
focus
attention
on
the
critical
unmet
needs
of
children
and
adolescents
with
mood
disorders
and
to
make
recommendations
for
future
research
and
allocation
of
healthcare
resources
The
36-member
Consensus
Development
Panel
consisted
of
experts
in
child/adolescent
or
adult
psychiatry
and
psychology
pediatrics
and
mental
health
advocacy
Reviews
of
the
literature
concerning
youth
mood
disorders
were
performed
on
the
subjects
of
risk
factors
prevention
diagnosis
treatment
and
services
delivery
and
opinions
and
experiences
of
mental
health
advocates
were
obtained
The
Consensus
Development
Panel
listened
to
presentations
and
participated
in
discussions
Independent
workgroups
of
clinicians
scientists
and
mental
health
advocates
considered
the
evidence
and
prepared
preliminary
statements
Workgroup
leaders
presented
drafts
for
discussion
by
the
Consensus
Development
Panel
The
final
document
was
reviewed
by
the
entire
group
and
edited
to
incorporate
input
from
all
participants
Evidence
suggests
high
rates
of
unmet
needs
for
children
and
adolescents
with
depression
or
bipolar
disorder
Training
is
largely
limited
to
child
mental
health
specialists
general
psychiatrists
pediatricians
and
other
primary
care
physicians
receive
little
or
no
training
As
a
result
treatment
patterns
may
reflect
adult
treatment
plans
that
are
not
validated
for
youths
Effective
treatments
have
been
identified
and
some
preliminary
prevention
models
have
been
developed
but
they
are
not
yet
widely
applied
Patients
experience
limited
exposure
to
clinicians
adequately
trained
to
address
their
problems
and
little
information
to
guide
care
decisions
particularly
concerning
bipolar
disorder
National
efforts
are
required
to
restructure
healthcare
delivery
and
provider
training
and
to
immediately
develop
more
advanced
research
on
pathophysiology
prevention
and
services
delivery
effectiveness
