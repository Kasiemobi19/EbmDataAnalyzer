Title
Does
using
the
Internet
facilitate
the
maintenance
of
weight
loss
Abstract
Text
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
effectiveness
of
a
weight
maintenance
program
conducted
over
the
Internet
Longitudinal
clinical
behavioral
weight
loss
trial
with
6-month
in-person
behavioral
obesity
treatment
followed
by
a
12-month
maintenance
program
conducted
both
in-person
(frequent
in-person
support
F-IPS
minimal
in-person
support
M-IPS)
and
over
the
Internet
(Internet
support
IS)
A
total
of
122
healthy
overweight
adults
(age=484+/-96
BMI=322+/-45
kg/m(2)
18
male)

Body
weight
dietary
intake
energy
expended
in
physical
activity
attendance
self-monitoring
comfort
with
technology
Results
(n=101)
showed
that
weight
loss
did
not
differ
by
condition
during
treatment
(80+/-5
vs
11+/-65
vs
98+/-59
kg
P=027
for
IS
M-IPS
and
F-IPS
respectively)
The
IS
condition
gained
significantly
more
weight
than
the
F-IPS
group
during
the
first
6
months
of
weight
maintenance
(+22+/-38
vs
0+/-4
kg
P<005)
and
sustained
a
significantly
smaller
weight
loss
than
both
in-person
support
groups
at
the
1
y
follow-up
(-57+/-59
vs
-104+/-93
vs
-104+/-63
kg
P<005
for
IS
M-IPS
and
F-IPS
respectively)
Attendance
at
maintenance
meetings
was
greater
for
the
F-IPS
than
the
IS
condition
over
the
1
y
maintenance
program
(54
vs
39%
P=004)
Acceptability
of
assigned
condition
was
higher
for
subjects
in
the
F-IPS
than
IS
condition
The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
Internet
support
does
not
appear
to
be
as
effective
as
minimal
or
frequent
intensive
in-person
therapist
support
for
facilitating
the
long-term
maintenance
of
weight
loss
