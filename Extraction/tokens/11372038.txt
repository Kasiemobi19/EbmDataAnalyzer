Safety
and
immunogenicity
of
a
conjugate
vaccine
against
Haemophilus
influenzae
type
b
in
splenectomized
and
nonsplenectomized
patients
with
Cooley
anemia
Abstract
Text
Patients
with
thalassemia
are
at
increased
risk
for
infections
especially
after
undergoing
splenectomy
Vaccinations
and
antimicrobial
prophylaxis
are
recommended
in
these
patients
but
the
optimal
immunization
schedule
for
Haemophilus
influenzae
type
b
(Hib)
vaccine
is
unknown
The
immunogenicity
of
a
conjugate
Hib
vaccine
was
investigated
in
57
patients
with
thalassemia
32
of
whom
had
undergone
splenectomy
Anti-capsular
antibodies
to
Hib
(anti-polyribosylribitol
phosphate)
were
measured
before
vaccination
and
2
6
12
24
and
36
months
after
vaccination
Immunization
was
well
tolerated
All
patients
achieved
protective
(>1
microg/mL)
antibody
levels
Antibody
titers
declined
after
the
initial
postvaccination
increase
becoming
undetectable
in
4
patients
and
decreasing
to
concentrations
of
015-1
microg/mL
in
another
2
patients
when
tested
2-3
years
after
vaccination
Hib
conjugate
vaccine
is
safe
and
immunogenic
in
patients
with
thalassemia
major
however
additional
studies
are
needed
to
assess
the
need
and
timing
of
booster
vaccination
to
maintain
long-term
immunity
