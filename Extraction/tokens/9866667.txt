Mupirocin
cream
is
as
effective
as
oral
cephalexin
in
the
treatment
of
secondarily
infected
wounds
Abstract
Text
Topical
antimicrobials
have
been
considered
for
treatment
of
secondarily
infected
wounds
because
of
the
potential
for
reduced
risk
of
adverse
effects
and
greater
patient
convenience
We
compared
mupirocin
cream
with
oral
cephalexin
in
the
treatment
of
wounds
such
as
small
lacerations
abrasions
or
sutured
wounds
In
2
identical
randomized
double-blind
studies
706
patients
with
secondarily
infected
wounds
(small
lacerations
abrasions
or
sutured
wounds)
received
either
mupirocin
cream
topically
3
times
daily
or
cephalexin
orally
4
times
daily
for
10
days
Clinical
success
at
follow-up
was
equivalent
in
the
two
groups
951%
and
953%
in
the
mupirocin
cream
and
the
cephalexin
groups
respectively
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
-40%
to
36%
P
=
89)
The
intention-to-treat
success
rate
was
83%
in
both
groups
Bacteriologic
success
at
follow-up
was
also
comparable
969%
in
the
mupirocin
cream
and
989%
in
the
cephalexin
groups
(95%
CI
-60%
to
20%
P
=
22)
The
occurrence
of
adverse
experiences
related
to
study
treatment
was
similar
for
the
2
groups
with
fewer
patients
in
the
mupirocin
cream
group
reporting
diarrhea
(11%
vs
23%
for
cephalexin)
Mupirocin
cream
applied
topically
3
times
daily
is
as
effective
as
oral
cephalexin
given
4
times
daily
for
the
treatment
of
secondarily
infected
wounds
and
was
well
tolerated
