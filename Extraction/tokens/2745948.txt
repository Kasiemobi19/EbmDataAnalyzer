Clinical
criteria
for
the
detection
of
pneumonia
in
adults
guidelines
for
ordering
chest
roentgenograms
in
the
emergency
department
Abstract
Text
Adults
presenting
to
an
emergency
department
with
acute
respiratory
illness
were
studied
prospectively
in
an
effort
to
identify
sensitive
clinical
criteria
for
the
diagnosis
of
pneumonia
Of
308
patients
studied
118
(38%)
had
definite
or
equivocal
infiltrates
and
were
considered
to
have
pneumonia
No
single
symptom
or
sign
was
reliably
predictive
of
pneumonia
Cough
was
the
most
common
symptom
in
patients
with
pneumonia
(86%)
but
was
equally
common
in
those
with
other
respiratory
illness
Fever
was
absent
in
36
patients
with
pneumonia
(31%)
Abnormal
findings
on
lung
examination
that
is
rales
rhonchi
decreased
breath
sounds
wheezes
altered
fremitus
egophony
and
percussion
dullness
were
each
found
in
fewer
than
half
of
the
patients
with
pneumonia
Twenty-six
patients
(22%)
with
a
completely
normal
chest
examination
had
pneumonia
Abnormal
vital
signs
(temperature
greater
than
378
degrees
C
(100
degrees
F)
pulse
greater
than
100/min
or
respirations
greater
than
20/min)
were
97%
sensitive
for
the
detection
of
pneumonia
These
criteria
retained
their
sensitivity
when
films
were
subjected
to
a
second
blinded
interpretation
by
a
senior
radiologist
We
conclude
that
restricting
chest
roentgenograms
to
patients
with
at
least
one
abnormal
vital
sign
will
detect
almost
all
radiographically
demonstrable
pneumonia
in
adult
emergency
department
patients
