Abstract
Text
The
significance
of
mild
hypercholesterolaemia
in
subclinical
hypothyroidism
and
whether
there
is
beneficial
reduction
after
thyroxine
replacement
remain
controversial
We
aimed
to
describe
the
association
between
hypercholesterolaemia
and
subclinical
hypothyroidism
and
to
quantify
the
effect
of
thyroid
substitution
therapy
by
an
analysis
of
previously
published
intervention
studies
Intervention
studies
cited
in
the
Medline
database
from
January
1976
until
January
1995
with
index
terms

hypercholesterolaemia
hyperlipidaemia
thyrotrophin
(TSH)
hypothyroidism

A
total
of
148

Qualitative
description
of

on
the

between

and

both
subclinical
and

Precision
weighted
pooled
estimates
of
the
effect
of
thyroid
substitution
therapy
on
the
plasma
levels
of
total
cholesterol
in
patients
with
subclinical
and
overt
hypothyroidism
Subclinical
hypothyroidism
was
two
to
three
times
more
frequent
in
people
with
an
elevated
total
plasma
cholesterol
In
addition
the
total
plasma
cholesterol
levels
were
slightly
elevated
in
patients
with
subclinical
dysfunction
of
the
thyroid
Thyroid
substitution
therapy
in
patients
with
subclinical
hypothyroidism
restoring
the
TSH
levels
to
normal
decreased
total
cholesterol
by
04
mmol/l
(95%
confidence
interval
(Cl)
02-06
mmol/l)
independently
of
the
initial
plasma
level
The
effect
of
thyroid
substitution
therapy
on
HDL-cholesterol
in
patients
with
subclinical
hypothyroidism
was
not
consistent
The
effect
of
thyroid
substitution
in
patients
with
overt
hypothyroidism
was
highly
dependent
on
the
pretreatment
levels
of
total
cholesterol
In
these
patients
substitution
therapy
decreased
total
cholesterol
by
12
mmol/l
(95%
Cl
09-15
mmol/l)
when
the
plasma
levels
were
elevated
up
to
8
mmol/l
and
by
34
mmol/l
(95%
Cl
30-37)
when
plasma
levels
were
higher
than
8
mmol/l
The
high
density
lipoprotein
(HDL)-cholesterol
level
decreased
and
amounted
to
016
mmol/l
(95%
Cl
007-024)
Thyroid
substitution
treatment
in
patients
with
hypercholesterolaemia
and
subclinical
hypothyroidism
decreases
total
plasma
cholesterol
by
04
mmol/l
but
plasma
levels
remain
elevated
in
most
patients
Further
treatment
with
dietary
restriction
and
cholesterol
synthesis
inhibitors
should
then
be
considered
