Abstract
Text
Current
prophylactic
feeding
guidelines
recommend
a
delayed
introduction
of
solids
for
the
prevention
of
atopic
diseases
This
study
investigates
whether
a
delayed
introduction
of
solids
(past
4
or
6
months)
is
protective
against
the
development
of
eczema
asthma
allergic
rhinitis
and
food
or
inhalant
sensitization
at
the
age
of
6
years
Data
from
2073
children
in
the
ongoing
LISA
birth
cohort
study
were
analyzed
at
6
years
of
age
Multivariate
logistic
regression
analyses
were
performed
for
all
children
and
for
children
without
skin
or
allergic
symptoms
within
the
first
6
months
of
life
to
take
into
account
reverse
causality
A
delayed
introduction
of
solids
(past
4
or
6
months)
was
not
associated
with
decreased
odds
for
asthma
allergic
rhinitis
or
sensitization
against
food
or
inhalant
allergens
at
6
years
of
age
On
the
contrary
food
sensitization
was
more
frequent
in
children
who
were
introduced
to
solids
later
The
relationship
between
the
timing
of
solid
food
introduction
and
eczema
was
not
clear
There
was
no
protective
effect
of
a
late
introduction
of
solids
or
a
less
diverse
diet
within
the
first
4
months
of
life
However
in
children
without
early
skin
or
allergic
symptoms
were
considered
eczema
was
significantly
more
frequent
in
children
who
received
a
more
diverse
diet
within
the
first
4
months
This
study
found
no
evidence
supporting
a
delayed
introduction
of
solids
beyond
4
or
6
months
for
the
prevention
of
asthma
allergic
rhinitis
and
food
or
inhalant
sensitization
at
the
age
of
6
years
For
eczema
the
results
were
conflicting
and
a
protective
effect
of
a
delayed
introduction
of
solids
cannot
be
excluded
Positive
associations
between
late
introduction
of
solids
and
food
sensitization
have
to
be
interpreted
with
caution
A
true
protective
effect
of
a
delayed
introduction
of
solids
on
food
sensitization
seems
unlikely
