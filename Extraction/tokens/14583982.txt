Title
Progestogen
for
preventing
miscarriage
Abstract
Text
Progesterone
a
female
sex
hormone
is
known
to
induce
secretory
changes
in
the
lining
of
the
uterus
essential
for
successful
implantation
of
a
fertilized
egg
It
has
been
suggested
that
a
causative
factor
in
many
cases
of
miscarriage
may
be
inadequate
secretion
of
progestogens
Therefore
progestational
agents
have
been
used
beginning
in
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
spontaneous
miscarriage
To
determine
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
progestogens
as
a
preventative
therapy
against
miscarriage
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group
trials
register
(April
2003)
CENTRAL
MEDLINE
(1966
to
April
2003)
EMBASE
(1980
to
April
2003)
CINAHL
(1982
to
April
2003)
NHMRC
Clinical
Trials
Register
(April
2003)
and
Meta-Register
(April
2003)
We
searched
references
from
relevant
articles
attempting
to
contact
authors
where
necessary
and
contacted
experts
in
the
field
for
unpublished
works
Randomised
or
quasi-randomised
controlled
trials
comparing
progestogens
with
placebo
or
no
treatment
given
in
an
effort
to
prevent
miscarriage
Thirty
trials
were
identified
in
the
initial
search
At
least
two
reviewers
assessed
trial
quality
and
extracted
data
Data
for
all
outcomes
were
in
dichotomous
form
and
the
Peto
odds
ratio
was
used
in
the
meta-analysis
for
all
comparisons
Fourteen
trials
(1988
women)
met
the
inclusion
criteria
The
meta-analysis
of
all
women
regardless
of
gravidity
and
number
of
previous
miscarriages
showed
no
statistically
significant
difference
in
the
risk
of
miscarriage
between
progestogen
and
placebo
or
no
treatment
groups
(odds
ratio
(OR)
105
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
083
to
134)
and
no
statistically
significant
difference
in
the
incidence
of
adverse
effect
in
either
mother
or
baby
In
a
subgroup
analysis
of
three
trials
involving
women
who
had
recurrent
miscarriages
(three
or
more
consecutive
miscarriages)
progestogen
treatment
showed
a
statistically
significant
decrease
in
miscarriage
rate
compared
to
placebo
or
no
treatment
(OR
039
95%
CI
017
to
091)
No
statistically
significant
differences
were
found
between
the
route
of
administration
of
progestogen
(oral
intramuscular
vaginal)
versus
placebo
or
no
treatment
There
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
routine
use
of
progestogen
to
prevent
miscarriage
in
early
to
mid
pregnancy
However
further
trials
in
women
with
a
history
of
recurrent
miscarriage
may
be
warranted
given
the
trend
for
improved
live
birth
rates
in
these
women
and
the
finding
of
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
treatment
and
control
groups
in
rates
of
adverse
effects
suffered
by
either
mother
or
baby
in
the
available
evidence
