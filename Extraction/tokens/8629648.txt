Intensity
of
murmurs
correlates
with
severity
of
valvular
regurgitation
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
relationship
between
the
intensity
of
murmurs
and
severity
of
mitral
and
aortic
regurgitation
Consecutive
patients
with
chronic
isolated
aortic
(n
=
40)
or
mitral
(n
=
170)
regurgitation
undergoing
echocardiographic
quantitation
of
regurgitation
between
1990
and
1991
were
studied
Regurgitant
volume
and
fraction
were
measured
using
two
simultaneous
methods
(quantitative
Doppler
echocardiography
and
quantitative
two-dimensional
echocardiography)
the
intensity
of
the
regurgitant
murmur
(grade
0
to
6)
was
noted
by
physicians
unaware
of
the
study
Correlations
between
murmur
intensity
and
regurgitant
volume
and
fraction
were
good
in
aortic
regurgitation
(r
=
60
and
r
=
67
respectively
P
<
0001)
and
mitral
regurgitation
(r
=
64
and
r
=
67
respectively
P
<
0001)
but
weaker
(r
=
47
and
r
=
45
respectively)
in
the
subset
of
mitral
regurgitation
of
ischemic
or
functional
cause
Murmur
intensity
grades
>
or
=
3
for
aortic
regurgitation
and
>
or
=
4
for
mitral
regurgitation
predicted
severe
regurgitation
(regurgitant
fraction
>
or
=
40%)
in
71%
and
91%
of
patients
respectively
Murmur
grades
<
or
=
1
for
aortic
regurgitation
and
<
or
=
2
for
mitral
regurgitation
predicted
"not
severe"
regurgitation
in
100%
and
88%
of
patients
respectively
Murmur
grades
2
for
aortic
regurgitation
and
3
for
mitral
regurgitation
were
not
correlated
to
degree
of
regurgitation
The
severity
of
regurgitation
was
the
most
powerful
determinant
of
intensity
of
murmur
Murmur
intensity
correlates
well
with
the
degree
of
chronic
organic
aortic
and
mitral
regurgitation
and
can
be
used
as
a
predictor
of
regurgitation
severity
and
as
a
simple
guideline
for
diagnostic
testing
in
these
patients
