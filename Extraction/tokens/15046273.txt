The
natural
history
of
idiopathic
toe-walking
a
long-term
follow-up
of
fourteen
conservatively
treated
children
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
long-term
results
after
conservative
treatment
(physiotherapy
casting
orthoses
or
a
combination
of
these)
of
idiopathic
toe-walking
(ITW)
Tiptoe-walking
is
diagnosed
as
idiopathic
(habitual)
if
no
signs
of
neurological
orthopaedic
or
psychiatric
disease
are
detected
The
diagnosis
is
one
of
exclusion
Sixteen
former
patients
with
ITW
all
now
at
least
13
y
old
were
asked
to
participate
in
a
follow-up
investigation
7-21
y
after
being
first
diagnosed
Two
cases
were
excluded
because
heel-cord
lengthening
had
been
performed
later
on
in
other
hospitals
The
remaining
14
patients
completed
a
questionnaire
Eleven
patients
consented
to
a
clinical
examination
during
which
they
were
videotaped
and
their
active
and
passive
ankle-joint
dorsiflexion
measured
These
data
were
compared
with
the
assessment
at
the
initial
evaluation
In
one
instance
the
toe-walking
ceased
after
conservative
treatment
(plaster
cast)
In
all
other
cases
the
toe-walking
pattern
recurred
At
follow-up
three
patients
showed
some
toe-walking
when
they
were
unobtrusively
observed
When
videotaped
they
did
not
toe-walk
although
a
distinct
heel-strike
was
missing
The
remaining
eight
patients
all
walked
with
a
heel-strike
Two
patients
had
slight
symptoms
possibly
related
to
toe-walking
No
fixed
contracture
was
present
at
the
first
evaluation
and
none
was
found
at
follow-up
There
was
no
systematic
change
in
ankle-joint
dorsiflexion
from
initial
assessment
to
follow-up
examination
Non-surgical
treatment
of
ITW
does
not
have
a
lasting
effect
and
the
long-term
results
in
this
study
are
considered
to
reflect
the
natural
history
ie
the
toe-walking
pattern
eventually
resolves
spontaneously
in
the
majority
of
children
Surgical
treatment
of
ITW
should
be
reserved
for
the
few
cases
with
a
fixed
ankle-joint
contracture
