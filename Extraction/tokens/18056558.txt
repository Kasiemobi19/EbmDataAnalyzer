Title
Effect
of
honey
dextromethorphan
and
no
treatment
on
nocturnal
cough
and
sleep
quality
for
coughing
children
and
their
parents
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
effects
of
a
single
nocturnal
dose
of
buckwheat
honey
or
honey-flavored
dextromethorphan
(DM)
with
no
treatment
on
nocturnal
cough
and
sleep
difficulty
associated
with
childhood
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
A
survey
was
administered
to
parents
on
2
consecutive
days
first
on
the
day
of
presentation
when
no
medication
had
been
given
the
prior
evening
and
then
the
next
day
when
honey
honey-flavored
DM
or
no
treatment
had
been
given
prior
to
bedtime
according
to
a
partially
double-blinded
randomization
scheme
A
single
outpatient
general
pediatric
practice
One
hundred
five
children
aged
2
to
18
years
with
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
nocturnal
symptoms
and
illness
duration
of
7
days
or
less
A
single
dose
of
buckwheat
honey
honey-flavored
DM
or
no
treatment
administered
30
minutes
prior
to
bedtime
Cough
frequency
cough
severity
bothersome
nature
of
cough
and
child
and
parent
sleep
quality
Significant
differences
in
symptom
improvement
were
detected
between
treatment
groups
with
honey
consistently
scoring
the
best
and
no
treatment
scoring
the
worst
In
paired
comparisons
honey
was
significantly
superior
to
no
treatment
for
cough
frequency
and
the
combined
score
but
DM
was
not
better
than
no
treatment
for
any
outcome
Comparison
of
honey
with
DM
revealed
no
significant
differences
In
a
comparison
of
honey
DM
and
no
treatment
parents
rated
honey
most
favorably
for
symptomatic
relief
of
their
child's
nocturnal
cough
and
sleep
difficulty
due
to
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
Honey
may
be
a
preferable
treatment
for
the
cough
and
sleep
difficulty
associated
with
childhood
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
