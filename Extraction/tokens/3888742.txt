Antepartum
fetal
surveillance
in
gestational
diabetes
mellitus
Abstract
Text
Pregnancy
in
patients
with
gestational
diabetes
mellitus
(GDM)
is
associated
with
increased
perinatal
morbidity
Whether
the
perinatal
mortality
rate
particularly
the
fetal
death
rate
is
greater
in
these
patients
remains
controversial
The
present
study
was
undertaken
to
review
the
role
of
antepartum
fetal
monitoring
in
69
patients
with
GDM
controlled
by
diet
only
(class
A)
and
28
women
requiring
insulin
therapy
(class
AB)
Hypertension
complicated
216%
of
these
pregnancies
Antepartum
fetal
surveillance
included
outpatient
nonstress
testing
urinary
estriol
assays
maternal
assessment
of
fetal
activity
and
clinical
estimation
of
fetal
weight
All
insulin-requiring
patients
as
well
as
fourteen
class
A
patients
with
identifiable
risk
factors
underwent
testing
No
perinatal
deaths
occurred
Only
six
patients
required
intervention
for
suspected
fetal
jeopardy
and
four
of
these
women
had
hypertension
Macrosomia
was
correctly
identified
in
only
6
of
16
infants
weighing
4000
g
or
more
This
study
suggests
that
in
GDM
an
outpatient
program
of
fetal
testing
using
primarily
the
nonstress
test
and
maternal
assessment
of
fetal
activity
can
be
employed
in
patients
requiring
insulin
as
well
as
class
A
patients
with
identifiable
risk
factors
This
protocol
resulted
in
a
low
rate
of
unnecessary
intervention
and
good
perinatal
outcome
The
risks
for
abnormal
antepartum
testing
results
appear
increased
in
GDM
with
hypertension
and
prolonged
pregnancy
