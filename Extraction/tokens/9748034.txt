Title
Effect
of
selegiline
on
mortality
in
patients
with
Parkinson's
disease
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
The
Parkinson's
Disease
Research
Group
of
the
United
Kingdom
(PDRG-UK)
reported
increased
mortality
in
PD
patients
treated
with
levodopa
plus
selegiline
compared
with
those
treated
with
levodopa
alone
We
performed
a
meta-analysis
on
five
long-term
prospective
randomized
trials
of
selegiline
in
patients
with
untreated
PD
Included
in
the
analysis
were
four
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
studies
and
one
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
of
2
years'
duration
followed
by
long-term
open
follow-up
The
mean
duration
of
follow-up
was
41
+/-
18
years
There
were
14
deaths
in
297
selegiline-treated
patients
(47%)
and
17
deaths
in
292
non-selegiline-treated
patients
(58%)
The
hazard
ratio
for
mortality
was
102
(95%
CI
044
to
237
p
=
096)
An
analysis
restricted
to
patients
receiving
only
levodopa
with
or
without
selegiline
noted
11
deaths
in
257
levodopa/selegiline-treated
patients
(43%)
and
11
deaths
in
254
patients
treated
with
levodopa
alone
(43%)
The
hazard
ratio
was
106
(95%
CI
044
to
255
p
=
090)
Death
rate
per
1000
patient
years
was
114
in
the
selegiline
group
and
142
in
the
nonselegiline
group
Kaplan-Meier
survival
curves
reflecting
pooled
survival
data
showed
no
significant
difference
in
duration
of
survival
The
hazard
ratio
was
084
(95%
CI
041
to
170
p
=
063)
for
selegiline-
versus
non-selegiline-treated
patients
and
105
(95%
CI
046
to
243
p
=
091)
for
selegiline/levodopa-
versus
levodopa-treated
patients
These
results
contrast
with
those
of
the
PDRG-UK
study
and
demonstrate
no
increase
in
mortality
associated
with
selegiline
treatment
whether
or
not
patients
also
received
levodopa
