Title
The
diagnosis
and
management
of
asymptomatic
primary
hyperparathyroidism
Abstract
Text
Classical
primary
hyperparathyroidism--a
disease
of
'bones
stones
and
psychic
groans'--is
a
rarity
in
the
US
although
it
is
still
seen
in
some
parts
of
the
world
Today
most
patients
with
primary
hyperparathyroidism
are
asymptomatic
This
change
in
clinical
profile
is
not
merely
because
of
improved
detection
techniques
and
patients
with
primary
hyperparathyroidism
who
lack
symptoms
if
left
untreated
rarely
develop
the
'classical'
features
that
were
common
previously
Indeed
currently
available
data
suggest
that
there
is
today
a
disorder
with
different
yet
characteristic
effects
on
the
end-organs
of
the
hyperparathyroid
process
In
this
review
the
features
of
the
skeletal
renal
neuropsychologic
cardiovascular
and
gastrointestinal
manifestations
of
'asymptomatic'
primary
hyperparathyroidism
will
be
discussed
The
considerable
body
of
data
that
has
emerged
since
the
recognition
of
the
new
clinical
profile
of
primary
hyperparathyroidism
has
allowed
a
reconsideration
of
standards
of
care
for
this
disease
These
data
were
reviewed
and
incorporated
into
new
clinical
guidelines
at
the
2002
NIH
workshop
on
asymptomatic
primary
hyperparathyroidism
These
recommendations
highlight
both
what
is
known
about
the
disease
and
important
areas
that
need
investigation
Continued
interest
in
the
skeletal
cardiovascular
and
neuropsychiatric
manifestations
of
the
disease
and
therapeutic
trials
of
medical
approaches
for
its
management
will
further
refine
our
current
understanding
and
could
lead
to
additional
modifications
in
the
approach
to
patients
with
this
common
endocrine
disorder
