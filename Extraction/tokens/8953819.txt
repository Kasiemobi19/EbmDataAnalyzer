Adverse
drug
reactions
with
fluoroquinolones
Abstract
Text
The
French
system
of
drug
surveillance
has
analysed
the
notifications
of
adverse
drug
reactions
(ADRs)
to
fluoroquinolones
since
they
were
launched
Their
frequency
ranges
from
1/15000
to
1/208000
case
per
days
of
treatment
Cutaneous
diseases
and
tendon
disorders
predominate
in
France
whereas
cutaneous
effects
and
neuropsychiatric
disorders
are
predominant
in
the
UK
tendon
disorders
take
up
only
the
5th
position
Among
the
most
unexpected
ADRs
are
the
following
-shock
represents
33
of
the
anaphylaxis
reactions
which
range
from
1/56
x
10(6)
to
1/44
x
10(5)
case
per
days
of
treatment
-acute
renal
failure
is
rare
one
case/80000
patients
treated
by
ciprofloxacin
to
1/320000
by
norfloxacin
The
pathophysiology
is
not
well
known
Tendon
ruptures
represent
81
cases
for
921
notifications
of
tendon
disorders
which
are
related
in
decreasing
order
to
pefloxacin
1/23130

days
of
treatment
ofloxacin
norfloxacin
and
ciprofloxacin
1/779600
case
per
days
of
treatment
Age
and
corticosteroids
increase
the
risk
of
tendon
rupture
