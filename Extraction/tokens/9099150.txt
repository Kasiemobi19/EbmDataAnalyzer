Title
Clinical
epidemiology
of
nocturnal
leg
cramps
in
male
veterans
Abstract
Text
This
article
describes
patients
with
nocturnal
leg
cramps
concerning
their
age
medical
problems
and
medications
and
reviews
any
medical
evaluation
performed
for
the
complaint
of
nocturnal
leg
cramps
Provided
is
a
retrospective
chart
review
of
50
patients
who
took
quinine
sulfate
for
nocturnal
leg
cramps
These
patients
were
identified
through
computerized
pharmacy
records
A
control
group
was
chosen
from
age-matched
patients
who
took
medications
other
than
quinine
during
the
study
period
In
a
university-affiliated
Veterans
Administration
hospital
patients
with
nocturnal
leg
cramps
had
a
significantly
higher
median
number
of
medical
problems
than
controls
Cardiovascular
diseases
and
neurological
diseases
were
significantly
more
common
in
patients
with
nocturnal
leg
cramps
(cases)
than
in
those
without
(controls)
(82%
versus
64%
and
36%
versus
18%
respectively)
The
most
striking
differences
between
patients
with
cramps
and
controls
were
peripheral
vascular
disease
(34%
versus
12%
P
=
009)
and
peripheral
neurological
deficit
(12%
versus
0%
P
=
0012)
Patients
with
nocturnal
leg
cramps
were
prescribed
significantly
more
medications
than
were
controls
but
no
specific
medication
or
type
of
medication
was
prescribed
more
frequently
to
patients
with
cramps
(other
than
quinine)
Results
suggested
that
men
with
nocturnal
leg
cramps
have
greater
medical
comorbidity
and
are
prescribed
more
medications
than
age-matched
control
patients
Unlike
in
previous
studies
no
evidence
was
found
that
specific
medications
such
as
diuretics
betaagonists
or
calcium-channel
antagonists
are
associated
with
nighttime
cramps
The
significantly
increased
frequency
of
peripheral
vascular
disease
and
peripheral
neurologic
deficits
in
patients
with
nocturnal
leg
cramps
raised
the
possibility
that
these
problems
contribute
to
the
occurrence
of
cramps
Although
the
size
of
the
study
and
its
methodologic
limitations
preclude
definitive
conclusions
areas
for
research
to
clarify
the
clinical
epidemiology
of
nocturnal
leg
cramps
are
suggested
