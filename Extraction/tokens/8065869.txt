Febrile
infants
at
low
risk
for
serious
bacterial
infection--an
appraisal
of
the
Rochester
criteria
and
implications
for
management
Febrile
Infant
Collaborative
Study
Group
Abstract
Text
Prospective
studies
were
conducted
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
infants
unlikely
to
have
serious
bacterial
infections
(SBI)
can
be
accurately
identified
by
low
risk
criteria
Febrile
infants
(rectal
T
>
or
=
38
degrees
C)
<
or
=
60
days
of
age
were
considered
at
low
risk
for
SBI
if
they
met
the
following
criteria
1)
appear
well
2)
were
previously
healthy
3)
have
no
focal
infection
4)
have

and
<
or

WBC
per
high
power
field
on
microscopic
examination
of
a
stool
smear
(if
diarrhea)
The
recommended
evaluation
included
the
culture
of
specimens
of
blood
cerebrospinal
fluid
and
urine
for
bacteria
Outcomes
were
determined
The
negative
predictive
values
of
the
low
risk
criteria
for
SBI
and
bacteremia
were
calculated
Of
1057
eligible
infants
931
were
well
appearing
and
of
these
437
met
the
remaining
low
risk
criteria
Five
low
risk
infants
had
SBI
including
two
infants
with
bacteremia
The
negative
predictive
value
of
the
low
risk
criteria
was
989%
(95%
confidence
interval
972%
to
996%)
for
SBI
and
995%
(95%
confidence
interval
982%
to
999%)
for
bacteremia
These
data
confirm
the
ability
of
the
low
risk
criteria
to
identify
infants
unlikely
to
have
SBI
Infants
who
meet
the
low
risk
criteria
can
be
carefully
observed
without
administering
antimicrobial
agents
