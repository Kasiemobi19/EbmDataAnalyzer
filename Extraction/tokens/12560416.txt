Relationship
between
pain
and
opioid
analgesics
on
the
development
of
delirium
following
hip
fracture
Abstract
Text
Delirium
and
pain
are
common
following
hip
fracture
Untreated
pain
has
been
shown
to
increase
the
risk
of
delirium
in
older
adults
undergoing
elective
surgery
This
study
was
performed
to
examine
the
relationship
among
pain
analgesics
and
other
factors
on
delirium
in
hip
fracture
patients
We
conducted
a
prospective
cohort
study
at
four
New
York
hospitals
that
enrolled
541
patients
with
hip
fracture
and
without
delirium
Delirium
was
identified
prospectively
by
patient
interview
supplemented
by
medical
record
review
Multiple
logistic
regression
was
used
to
identify
risk
factors
Eighty-seven
of
541
patients
(16%)
became
delirious
Among
all
subjects
risk
factors
for
delirium
were
cognitive
impairment
(relative
risk
or
RR
36
95%
confidence
interval
or
CI
18-72)
abnormal
blood
pressure
(RR
23
95%
CI
12-47)
and
heart
failure
(RR
29
95%
CI
16-53)
Patients
who
received
less
than
10
mg
of
parenteral
morphine
sulfate
equivalents
per
day
were
more
likely
to
develop
delirium
than
patients
who
received
more
analgesia
(RR
54
95%
CI
24-123)
Patients
who
received
meperidine
were
at
increased
risk
of
developing
delirium
as
compared
with
patients
who
received
other
opioid
analgesics
(RR
24
95%
CI
13-45)
In
cognitively
intact
patients
severe
pain
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
delirium
(RR
90
95%
CI
18-452)
Using
admission
data
clinicians
can
identify
patients
at
high
risk
for
delirium
following
hip
fracture
Avoiding
opioids
or
using
very
low
doses
of
opioids
increased
the
risk
of
delirium
Cognitively
intact
patients
with
undertreated
pain
were
nine
times
more
likely
to
develop
delirium
than
patients
whose
pain
was
adequately
treated
Undertreated
pain
and
inadequate
analgesia
appear
to
be
risk
factors
for
delirium
in
frail
older
adults
