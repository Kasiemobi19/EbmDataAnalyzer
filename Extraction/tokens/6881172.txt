Decreased
requirement
for
thyroid
hormone
in
older
hypothyroid
patients
Abstract
Text
In
84
patients
aged
23
to
84
with
primary
hypothyroidism
the
daily
dose
of
thyroxine
needed
to
lower
the
serum
thyrotropin
level
into
the
normal
range
was
significantly
less
in
older
patients
than
in
younger
ones
(p
less
than
001)
Most
of
the
difference
between
middle-aged
(40
to
60
years)
and
older
patients
(greater
than
60
years)
was
due
to
a
decrease
in
the
required
dose
in
men
there
was
no
difference
in
the
dose
needed
by
women
in
these
age
groups
Previous
hyperthyroidism
did
not
affect
the
dose
of
thyroxine
required
it
is
unlikely
that
residual
autonomous
thyroid
tissue
affected
the
dose
Although
the
wide
range
of
doses
needed
precludes
use
of
these
data
in
calculating
a
dose
of
thyroxine
for
an
individual
patient
doses
of
100
micrograms
per
day
or
less
were
common
in
patients
over
age
40
and
a
few
patients
over
age
60
needed
50
micrograms
per
day
or
less
Thus
(1)
there
is
a
sound
physiologic
basis
for
the
common
practice
of
using
low
doses
of
thyroxine
eg
25
micrograms
per
day
as
initial
therapy
in
older
hypothyroid
patients
and
(2)
it
may
be
reasonable
to
reassess
the
dose
of
thyroxine
after
several
years
in
older
patients
