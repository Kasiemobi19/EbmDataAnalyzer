Title
Tissue
adhesives
for
traumatic
lacerations
in
children
and
adults
Abstract
Text
Tissue
adhesives
have
been
used
for
many
years
to
close
simple
lacerations
as
an
alternative
to
standard
wound
closure
(sutures
staples
adhesive
strips)
They
offer
many
potential
advantages
over
standard
wound
closure
including
ease
of
use
decrease
in
pain
and
time
to
apply
as
well
as
not
requiring
a
follow-up
visit
for
removal
Many
studies
have
compared
tissue
adhesives
and
standard
wound
closure
to
determine
the
cosmetic
outcome
as
well
as
these
other
secondary
outcomes
in
their
respective
study
populations
However
due
to
the
wide
variation
in
study
parameters
there
are
no
generalisable
definitive
answers
about
the
effectiveness
of
tissue
adhesives
No
study
has
been
adequately
powered
to
assess
differences
in
complications
which
are
rare
To
summarize
the
best
available
evidence
for
the
effect
of
tissue
adhesives
in
the
management
of
traumatic
lacerations
in
children
and
adults
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
(CD
ROM
2001
Issue

the
Cochrane
Wounds
Group
Specialized
Trials
Register
(Nov
2001)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
Oct
1
2001)
and
EMBASE
(1988
to
Sept
1
2001)
for
relevant
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
We
also
searched
the
citations
of
selected
studies
and
we
contacted
relevant
authors
and
manufacturers
of
tissue
adhesives
to
inquire
about
other
published
and
unpublished
trials
We
included
RCTs
comparing
tissue
adhesives
versus
standard
wound
closure
or
tissue
adhesive
versus
tissue
adhesive
for
acute
linear
low
tension
traumatic
lacerations
in
an
emergency
or
primary
care
setting
Trials
evaluating
tissue
adhesives
for
surgical
incisions
or
other
types
of
wounds
were
not
considered
Data
from
eligible
studies
were
extracted
by
one
reviewer
and
checked
for
accuracy
by
a
second
reviewer
Two
reviewers

assessed

and

were
analysed
separately
for
two
comparisons
1)
tissue

versus

and
2)
tissue

versus

Eight
studies
compared
a
tissue
adhesive
with
standard
wound
care
No
significant
difference
was
found
for
cosmesis
at
any
of
the
time
points
examined
using
either
Cosmetic
Visual
Analogue
Scale
(CVAS)
or
Wound

(WES)
Data
were
only
available
for
subgroup
analysis
for

no

were
found

Other

were

Only
one
study
was
identified
that
compared
two
tissue
adhesives
(butylcyanoacrylate
(Histoacryl
TM)
versus
octylcyanoacrylate
(Dermabond
TM))
for
pediatric
facial
lacerations
No
significant
difference
was
found
for
cosmesis
using
CVAS
at
1-3
months
or
using
WES
at
5-14
days
and
1-3
months
Similarly
no
significant
difference
was
found
in
pain
procedure
time
or
complications
Results
for
ease
of
use
were
incomplete
as
reported
Tissue
adhesives
are
an
acceptable
alternative
to
standard
wound
closure
for
repairing
simple
traumatic
lacerations
There
is
no
significant
difference
in
cosmetic
outcome
between
tissue
adhesives
and
standard
wound
closure
or
between
different
tissue
adhesives
They
offer
the
benefit
of
decreased
procedure
time
and
less
pain
compared
to
standard
wound
closure
A
small
but
statistically
significant
increased
rate
of
dehiscence
with
tissue
adhesives
must
be
considered
when
choosing
the
closure
method
