Gynaecology
department
of
a

UK
teaching
hospital
Women
referred
to
the
gynaecologist
for
treatment
of
heavy
menstrual
loss
Eligible
women
without
a
treatment
preference
were
randomised
equally
to
either
medical

transcervical

One
hundred
and
forty-four
patients
completed
questionnaires
achieving
77%
follow
up
(medical

At
five-year
follow
up
7/71
(10%)
of
those
randomised
to
the
medical
arm
still
used
medical
treatment
while
72/94
(77%)
had
undergone
surgical
treatment
and
17/94
(18%)
a
hysterectomy
Twenty-five
(27%)
women
allocated
to
transcervical
resection
of
the
endometrium
had
undergone
further
surgery
18/93
(19%)
a
hysterectomy
At
five
years
women
initially
randomised
to
medical
treatment
were
significantly
less
likely
to
be
totally
satisfied
(P
<

difference
21%
95%

or
to

their
allocated

to
a
friend
(P

difference
59%
95%
CI
-73%
to
-45%)
Bleeding
and
pain
scores
were
similar
in
both
groups
and
highly
significantly
reduced
Significantly
more
women
in
the
transcervical
resection
of
the
endometrium
arm
had
no
bleeding
or
very
light
bleeding
(P
<

and
they
had
significantly
less

health
survey
scores
were
significantly
improved
from
baseline
for
all
eight
health
scales
in
the
transcervical
resection
of
the
endometrium
arm
and
four
in
the
medical
arm
A
policy
of
immediate
transcervical
resection
of
the
endometrium
for
women
referred
to
a
gynaecologist
for
treatment
of
heavy
menstrual
loss
achieves
higher
levels
of
satisfaction
better
menstrual
status
and
greater
improvements
in
health
related
quality
of
life
than
medical
treatment
In
addition
transcervical
resection
of
the
endometrium
is
safe
and
does
not
lead
to
an
increase
in
the
number
of
hysterectomies
An
effective
endometrial
ablative
technique
should
be
offered
to
all
eligible
women
seeking
treatment
of
their
heavy
menses
from
a
gynaecologist
