This
chapter
about
antithrombotic
therapy
for
venous
thromboembolic
disease
is
part
of
the
seventh
ACCP
Conference
on
Antithrombotic
and
Thrombolytic
Therapy
Evidence
Based
Guidelines
Grade
1
recommendations
are
strong
and
indicate
that
the
benefits
do
or
do
not
outweigh
risks
burden
and
costs
Grade
2
suggests
that
individual
patients'
values
may
lead
to
different
choices
(for
a
full
understanding
of

Among
the
key
recommendations
in
this
chapter
are
the
following
for
patients
with
objectively
confirmed
deep
vein
thrombosis
(DVT)
we
recommend
short-term
treatment
with
subcutaneous
(SC)
low
molecular
weight
heparin
(LMWH)
or
alternatively
IV
unfractionated
heparin
(UFH)
[both
Grade
1A]
For
patients
with
a
high
clinical
suspicion
of
DVT
we
recommend
treatment
with
anticoagulants
while
awaiting
the
outcome
of
diagnostic
tests
(Grade
1C+)
In
acute
DVT
we
recommend
initial
treatment
with
LMWH
or
UFH
for
at
least
5
days
(Grade
1C)
initiation
of
vitamin
K
antagonist
(VKA)
together
with
LMWH
or
UFH
on
the
first
treatment
day
and
discontinuation
of
heparin
when
the
international
normalized
ratio
(INR)
is
stable
and
>
20
(Grade
1A)
For
the
duration
and
intensity
of
treatment
for
acute
DVT
of
the
leg
the
recommendations
include
the
following
for
patients
with
a
first
episode
of
DVT
secondary
to
a
transient
(reversible)
risk
factor
we
recommend
long-term
treatment
with
a
VKA
for
3
months
over
treatment
for
shorter
periods
(Grade
1A)
For
patients
with
a
first
episode
of
idiopathic
DVT
we
recommend
treatment
with
a
VKA
for
at
least
6
to
12
months
(Grade
1A)
We
recommend
that
the
dose
of
VKA
be
adjusted
to
maintain
a
target
INR
of
25
(INR
range
20
to
30)
for
all
treatment
durations
(Grade
1A)
We
recommend
against
high-intensity
VKA
therapy
(INR
range
31
to
40)
[Grade
1A]
and
against
low-intensity
therapy
(INR
range
15
to
19)
compared
to
INR
range
of
20
to
30
(Grade
1A)
For
the
prevention
of
the
postthrombotic
syndrome
we
recommend
the
use
of
an
elastic
compression
stocking
(Grade
1A)
For
patients
with
objectively
confirmed
nonmassive
PE
we
recommend
acute
treatment
with
SC
LMWH
or
alternatively
IV
UFH
(both
Grade
1A)
For
most
patients
with
pulmonary
embolism
(PE)
we
recommend
clinicians
not
use
systemic
thrombolytic
therapy
(Grade
1A)
For
the
duration
and
intensity
of
treatment
for
PE
the
recommendations
are
similar
to
those
for
DVT
