Sex-based
differences
in
the
effect
of
digoxin
for
the
treatment
of
heart
failure
Abstract
Text
The
Digitalis
Investigation
Group
trial
reported
that
treatment
with
digoxin
did
not
decrease
overall
mortality
among
patients
with
heart
failure
and
depressed
left
ventricular
systolic
function
although
it
did
reduce
hospitalizations
slightly
Even
though
the
epidemiologic
features
causes
and
prognosis
of
heart
failure
vary
between
men
and
women
sex-based
differences
in
the
effect
of
digoxin
were
not
evaluated
We
conducted
a
post
hoc
subgroup
analysis
to
assess
whether
there
were
sex-based
differences
in
the
effect
of
digoxin
therapy
among
the
6800
patients
in
the
Digitalis
Investigation
Group
study
The
presence
of
an
interaction
between
sex
and
digoxin
therapy
with
respect
to
the
primary
end
point
of
death
from
any
cause
was
evaluated
with
the
use
of
Mantel-Haenszel
tests
of
heterogeneity
and
a
multivariable
Cox
proportional-hazards
model
adjusted
for
demographic
and
clinical
variables
There
was
an
absolute
difference
of
58
percent
(95
percent
confidence
interval
05
to
111)
between
men
and
women
in
the
effect
of
digoxin
on
the
rate
of
death
from
any
cause
(P=0034
for
the
interaction)
Specifically
women
who
were
randomly
assigned
to
digoxin
had
a
higher
rate
of
death
than
women
who
were
randomly
assigned
to
placebo
(331
percent
vs
289
percent
absolute
difference
42
percent
95
percent
confidence
interval
-05
to
88)
In
contrast
the
rate
of
death
was
similar
among
men
randomly
assigned
to
digoxin
and
men
randomly
assigned
to
placebo
(352
percent
vs
369
percent
absolute
difference
-16
percent
95
percent
confidence
interval
-42
to
10)
In
the
multivariable
analysis
digoxin
was
associated
with
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
death
among
women
(adjusted
hazard
ratio
for
the
comparison
with
placebo
123
95
percent
confidence
interval
102
to
147)
but
it
had
no
significant
effect
among
men
(adjusted
hazard
ratio
093
95
percent
confidence
interval
085
to
102
P=0014
for
the
interaction)
The
effect
of
digoxin
therapy
differs
between
men
and
women
Digoxin
therapy
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
death
from
any
cause
among
women
but
not
men
with
heart
failure
and
depressed
left
ventricular
systolic
function
