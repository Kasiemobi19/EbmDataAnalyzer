Effects
of
low-carbohydrate
vs
low-fat
diets
on
weight
loss
and
cardiovascular
risk
factors
a
meta-analysis
of
randomized
controlled
trials
Abstract
Text
Low-carbohydrate
diets
have
become
increasingly
popular
for
weight
loss
However
evidence
from
individual
trials
about
benefits
and
risks
of
these
diets
to
achieve
weight
loss
and
modify
cardiovascular
risk
factors
is
preliminary
We
used
the
Cochrane
Collaboration
search
strategy
to
identify
trials
comparing
the
effects
of
low-carbohydrate
diets
without
restriction
of
energy
intake
vs
low-fat
diets
in
individuals
with
a
body
mass
index
(calculated
as
weight
in
kilograms
divided
by
the
square
of
height
in
meters)
of
at
least
25
Included
trials
had
to
report
changes
in
body
weight
in
intention-to-treat
analysis
and
to
have
a
follow-up
of
at
least
6
months
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
trial
eligibility
and
quality
of
randomized
controlled
trials
Five
trials
including
a
total
of
447
individuals
fulfilled
our
inclusion
criteria
After
6
months
individuals
assigned
to
low-carbohydrate
diets
had
lost
more
weight
than
individuals
randomized
to
low-fat
diets
(weighted
mean
difference
-33
kg
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
-53
to
-14
kg)
This
difference
was
no
longer
obvious
after
12
months
(weighted
mean
difference
-10
kg
95%
CI
-35
to
15
kg)
There
were
no
differences
in
blood
pressure
Triglyceride
and
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
values
changed
more
favorably
in
individuals
assigned
to
low-carbohydrate
diets
(after
6
months
for
triglycerides
weighted
mean
difference
-221
mg/dL
[-025
mmol/L]
95%
CI
-381
to
-53
mg/dL
[-043
to
-006
mmol/L]
and
for
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
weighted
mean
difference
46
mg/dL
[012
mmol/L]
95%
CI
15-81
mg/dL
[004-021
mmol/L])
but
total
cholesterol
and
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
values
changed
more
favorably
in
individuals
assigned
to
low-fat
diets
(weighted
mean
difference
in
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
after
6
months
54
mg/dL
[014
mmol/L]
95%
CI
12-101
mg/dL
[003-026
mmol/L])
Low-carbohydrate
non-energy-restricted
diets
appear
to
be
at
least
as
effective
as
low-fat
energy-restricted
diets
in
inducing
weight
loss
for
up
to
1
year
However
potential
favorable
changes
in
triglyceride
and
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
values
should
be
weighed
against
potential
unfavorable
changes
in
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
values
when
low-carbohydrate
diets
to
induce
weight
loss
are
considered
