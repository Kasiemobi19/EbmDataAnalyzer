Abstract
Text
Metoprolol
can
improve
haemodynamics
in
chronic
heart
failure
but
survival
benefit
has
not
been
proven
We
investigated
whether
metoprolol
controlled
release/extended
release
(CR/XL)
once
daily
in
addition
to
standard
therapy
would
lower
mortality
in
patients
with
decreased
ejection
fraction
and
symptoms
of
heart
failure
We
enrolled
3991
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
in
New
York
Heart
Association
(NYHA)
functional
class
II-IV
and
with
ejection
fraction
of
040
or
less
stabilised
with
optimum
standard
therapy
in
a
double-blind
randomised
controlled
study
Randomisation
was
preceded
by
a
2-week
single-blind
placebo
run-in
period
1990
patients
were
randomly
assigned
metoprolol
CR/XL
125
mg
(NYHA
III-IV)
or
250
mg
once
daily
(NYHA
II)
and
2001
were
assigned
placebo
The
target
dose
was
200
mg
once
daily
and
doses
were
up-titrated
over
8
weeks
Our
primary
endpoint
was
all-cause
mortality
analysed
by
intention
to
treat
The
study
was
stopped
early
on
the
recommendation
of
the
independent
safety
committee
Mean
follow-up
time
was
1
year
All-cause
mortality
was
lower
in
the
metoprolol
CR/XL
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
(145
[72%
per
patient-year
of
follow-up])
vs
217
deaths
[110%]
relative
risk
066
[95%
CI
053-081]
p=000009
or
adjusted
for
interim
analyses
p=00062)
There
were
fewer
sudden
deaths
in
the
metoprolol
CR/XL
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
(79
vs
132
059
[045-078]
p=00002)
and
deaths
from
worsening
heart
failure
(30
vs
58
051
[033-079]
p=00023)
Metoprolol
CR/XL
once
daily
in
addition
to
optimum
standard
therapy
improved
survival
The
drug
was
well
tolerated
