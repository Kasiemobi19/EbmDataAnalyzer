The
influence
of
elective
amniotomy
on
fetal
heart
rate
patterns
and
the
course
of
labor
in
term
patients
a
randomized
study
Abstract
Text
Our
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
routine
elective
amniotomy
on
the
frequency
and
severity
of
abnormal
fetal
heart
rate
patterns
and
on
the
course
of
labor
and
the
need
for
oxytocin
augmentation
A
randomized
controlled
trial
was
conducted
at
term
in
patients
in
active
labor
who
were
randomly
selected
to
undergo
elective
amniotomy
(amniotomy
group)
or
left
intact
with
amniotomy
reserved
for
specific
indications
(intact
group)
Four
hundred
fifty-nine
patients
were
studied
(235
in
the
amniotomy
group
vs
224
in
the
intact
group)
Average
cervical
dilatation
at
rupture
was
55
cm
in
the
amniotomy
group
and
81
cm
in
the
intact
group
Analysis
of
fetal
heart
rate
revealed
more
mild
and
moderate
variable
decelerations
in
the
active
phase
of
labor
in
the
amniotomy
group
but
no
difference
in
the
frequency
of
more
severe
decelerations
or
operative
deliveries
In
the
intact
group
the
need
for
oxytocin
was
twice
as
common
(76
in
the
intact
group
vs
36
in
the
amniotomy
group
p
=
0000005)
and
the
active
phase
of
labor
was
considerably
longer
(5
hours
56
minutes
in
the
intact
group
vs
4
hours
35
minutes
in
the
amniotomy
group)
Neonatal
outcome
was
similar
in
the
two
groups
Elective
amniotomy
appears
to
increase
the
likelihood
of
umbilical
cord
compression
in
the
active
phase
of
labor
and
results
in
more
mild
and
moderate
variable
decelerations
but
it
does
not
result
in
more
severe
abnormal
fetal
heart
rate
patterns
or
more
operative
intervention
Elective
amniotomy
does
however
shorten
the
active
phase
of
labor
and
decreases
the
need
for
oxytocin
augmentation
