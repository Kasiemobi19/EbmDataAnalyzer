Beta-blockers
to
reduce
mortality
in
patients
with
systolic
dysfunction
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
The
researchers
reviewed
published
clinical
trials
and
performed
a
meta-analysis
to
assess
if
therapy
with
adrenergic
beta-antagonists
(beta-blockers)
reduces
the
risk
of
mortality
in
patients
with
systolic
dysfunction
A
systematic
review
was
performed
with
meta-analysis
where
appropriate
Clinical
trials
were
reviewed
with
respect
to
the
quality
of
the
research
methods
including
patient
population
and
end
points
Two
independent
reviewers
calculated
relative
risk
relative
risk
reduction
absolute
risk
reduction
and
number
needed
to
treat
for
the
total
mortality
end
point
reported
in
each
trial
A
meta-analysis
was
performed
The
study
team
searched
pertinent
indexing
services
and
references
from
published
articles
for
relevant
literature
The
selected
clinical
trials
were
randomized
double-blinded
and
controlled
and
included
patients
with
systolic
heart
failure
Mortality
was
assessed
as
a
primary
or
secondary
end
point
The
primary
outcome
was
mortality
Statistically
and
clinically
significant
improvement
including
a
statistically
significant
reduction
in
mortality
has
been
noted
in
patients
receiving
therapy
with
either
bisoprolol
carvedilol
or
metoprolol
Pooled
analysis
revealed
a
statistically
significant
reduction
in
the
risk
of
total
mortality
(odds
ratio
[OR]MH=066
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
058-075)
and
sudden
death
(ORMH=061
95%
CI
05-075)
for
patients
receiving
beta-blocker
therapy
All
patients
with
New
York
Heart
Association
class
II
and
III
heart
failure
should
receive
beta-blocker
therapy
with
bisoprolol
carvedilol
or
metoprolol
Additional
clinical
trials
are
ongoing
and
will
provide
further
data
on
which
patients
receive
the
greatest
benefit
from
therapy
and
which
beta-blocker
may
be
preferred
