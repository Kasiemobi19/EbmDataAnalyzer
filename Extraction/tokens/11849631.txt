the

pooled

Abstract
Text
To
present
efficacy
and
cycle
control
data
pooled
from
three
pivotal
studies
of
the
contraceptive
patch
(Ortho
Evra/Evra)
Three
multicenter
open-label
contraceptive
studies
that
included
up
to
13
treatment
cyclesSetting
183

womenIntervention(s)
Three
consecutive
7-day
patches
(21
days)
with
1
patch-free
week
per
cycle
Contraceptive
efficacy
and
cycle
control
Overall
and
method
failure
life-table
estimates
of
contraceptive
failure
through
13
cycles
were
08%
(95%
CI
03%-13%)
and
06%
(95%
CI
02%-09%)
respectively
Corresponding
Pearl
indices
were
088
(95%
CI
044-133)
and
07
(95%
CI
031-110)
Contraceptive
failure
among
women
with
a
body
weight
<
90
kg
(<198
lb)
was
low
and
uniformly
distributed
across
the
weight
range
A
subgroup
of
women
with
body
weight
>
or
=
90
kg
(>
or
=
198
lb)
may
have
increased
risk
of
pregnancy
The
incidence
of
breakthrough
bleeding
was
low
and
decreased
over
time
In
contraceptive
patch
users
the
overall
annual
probability
of
pregnancy
was
08%
and
the
method
failure
probability
was
06%
The
efficacy
of
the
patch
was
high
and
similar
across
age
and
racial
groups
Among
women
<
90
kg
(<198
lb)
contraceptive
failure
was
low
and
uniformly
distributed
across
the
range
of
body
weights
In
women
>
or
=
90
kg
(>
or
=
198
lb)
contraceptive
failures
may
be
increased
Efficacy
and
cycle
control
have
been
shown
to
be
comparable
to
an
established
oral
contraceptive
