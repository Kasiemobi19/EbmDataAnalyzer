Use
of
copper
intrauterine
devices
and
the
risk
of
tubal
infertility
among
nulligravid
women
Abstract
Text
Previous
studies
of
intrauterine
devices
(IUDs)
many
of
which
are
no
longer
in
use
suggested
that
they
might
cause
tubal
infertility
The
concern
that
IUDs
that
contain
copper--currently
the
most
commonly
used
type--may
increase
the
risk
of
infertility
in
nulligravid
women
has
limited
the
use
of
this
highly
effective
method
of
birth
control
We
conducted
a
case-control
study
of
1895
women
recruited
between
1997
and
1999
We
enrolled
358
women
with
primary
infertility
who
had
tubal
occlusion
documented
by
hysterosalpingography
as
well
as
953
women
with
primary
infertility
who
did
not
have
tubal
occlusion
(infertile
controls)
and
584
primigravid
women
(pregnant
controls)
We
collected
information
on
the
women's
past
use
of
contraceptives
including
copper
IUDs
previous
sexual
relationships
and
history
of
genital
tract
infections
Each
woman's
blood
was
tested
for
antibodies
to
Chlamydia
trachomatis
We
used
stratified
analyses
and
logistic
regression
to
assess
the
association
between
the
previous
use
of
a
copper
IUD
and
tubal
occlusion
In
analyses
involving
the
women
with
tubal
occlusion
and
the
infertile
controls
the
odds
ratio
for
tubal
occlusion
associated
with
the
previous
use
of
a
copper
IUD
was
10
(95
percent
confidence
interval
06
to
17)
When
the
primigravid
women
served
as
the
controls
the
corresponding
odds
ratio
was
09
(95
percent
confidence
interval
05
to
16)
Tubal
infertility
was
not
associated
with
the
duration
of
IUD
use
the
reason
for
the
removal
of
the
IUD
or
the
presence
or
absence
of
gynecologic
problems
related
to
its
use
The
presence
of
antibodies
to
chlamydia
was
associated
with
infertility
The
previous
use
of
a
copper
IUD
is
not
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
tubal
occlusion
among
nulligravid
women
whereas
infection
with
C
trachomatis
is
