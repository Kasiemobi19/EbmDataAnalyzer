The
association
of
changes
in
physical-activity
level
and
other
lifestyle
characteristics
with
mortality
among
men
Abstract
Text
Recent
trends
toward
increasing
physical
exercise
stopping
cigarette
smoking
and
avoiding
obesity
may
increase
longevity
We
analyzed
changes
in
the
lifestyles
of
Harvard
College
alumni
and
the
associations
of
these
changes
with
mortality
Men
who
were
45
to
84
years
of
age
in
1977
and
who
had
reported
no
life-threatening
disease
on
questionnaires
completed
in
1962
or
1966
and
again
in
1977
were
classified
according
to
changes
in
lifestyle
characteristics
between
the
first
and
second
questionnaires
We
analyzed
changes
in
their
level
of
physical
activity
cigarette
smoking
blood
pressure
and
body
weight
and
the
relation
of
these
factors
to
mortality
between
1977
and
1985
Of
the
10269
men
476
died
during
this
period
(which
totaled
90650
man-years
of
observation)
Beginning
moderately
vigorous
sports
activity
(at
an
intensity
of
45
or
more
metabolic
equivalents)
was
associated
with
a
23
percent
lower
risk
of
death
(95
percent
confidence
interval
4
to
42
percent
P
=
0015)
than
not
taking
up
moderately
vigorous
sports
Quitting
cigarette
smoking
was
associated
with
a
41
percent
lower
risk
(95
percent
confidence
interval
20
to
57
percent
P
=
0001)
than
continuing
smoking
but
with
a
23
percent
higher
risk
than
constant
nonsmoking
Men
with
recently
diagnosed
hypertension
had
a
lower
risk
of
death
than
those
with
long-term
hypertension
(relative
risk
075
95
percent
confidence
interval
055
to
102
P
=
0057)
as
did
men
with
consistently
normal
blood
pressure
(relative
risk
052
95
percent
confidence
interval
040
to
068
P
<
0001)
Maintenance
of
lean
body
mass
was
associated
with
a
lower
mortality
rate
than
long-term
recent
or
previous
obesity
The
associations
between
changes
in
lifestyle
and
mortality
were
independent
and
were
largely
undiminished
by
age
Our
findings
on
death
from
coronary
heart
disease
mirrored
those
on
death
from
all
causes
Beginning
moderately
vigorous
sports
activity
quitting
cigarette
smoking
maintaining
normal
blood
pressure
and
avoiding
obesity
were
separately
associated
with
lower
rates
of
death
from
all
causes
and
from
coronary
heart
disease
among
middle-aged
and
older
men
