The
prevalence
and
severity
of
fluorosis
in
children
who
received
toothpaste
containing
either
440
or
1450
ppm
F
from
the
age
of
12
months
in
deprived
and
less
deprived
communities
Abstract
Text
This
study
compared
fluorosis
in
the
upper
central
incisors
of
children
from
socially
diverse
backgrounds
who
had
received
either
440-
or
1450-ppm
F
toothpaste
from
12
months
of
age
The
children
were
resident
in
non-fluoridated
districts
in
the
north-west
of
England
They
received
either
440-
or
1450-ppm
F
toothpaste
and
advice
regarding
its
use
until
the
age
of
5-6
years
Dental
fluorosis
(TF
index)
was
assessed
on
digital
images
of
dried
teeth
when
the
children
(n
=
1268)
were
8-10
years
old
In
the
less
deprived
districts
the
prevalences
of
fluorosis
(TF
>or=0)
for
the
1450-
and
440-ppm
F
groups
were
345
and
237%
(p
=
0006)
In
the
deprived
districts
the
prevalences
of
fluorosis
were
252
and
195%
(p
=
02)
Overall
the
prevalences
of
TF
>or=2
were
7
and
21%
for
the
1450-
and
440-ppm
F
groups
and
22
and
02%
for
TF
>or=3
These
differences
were
statistically
significant
(p
<
0003)
There
was
a
strong
association
between
the
deprivation
status
of
wards
and
fluorosis
Only
1
subject
with
a
TF
score
of
3
was
identified
in
the
two
most
deprived
quintiles
of
the
Townsend
score
It
is
concluded
that
careful
targeting
of
programmes
of
this
type
to
children
living
in
high
caries
risk
deprived
communities
carries
only
a
small
risk
of
aesthetically
objectionable
fluorosis
(TF
>2)
whether
low
or
high
fluoride
toothpastes
are
used
High
fluoride
(1450
ppm
F)
toothpastes
should
not
be
provided
on
a
community
basis
to
very
young
children
in
less
deprived
communities
