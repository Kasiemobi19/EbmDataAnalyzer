the
NCAA
Concussion
Study
Abstract
Text
Lack
of
empirical
data
on
recovery
time
following
sport-related
concussion
hampers
clinical
decision
making
about
return
to
play
after
injury
To
prospectively
measure
immediate
effects
and
natural
recovery
course
relating
to
symptoms
cognitive
functioning
and
postural
stability
following
sport-related
concussion
Prospective
cohort
study
of
1631
football
players
from
15
US
colleges
All
players
underwent
preseason
baseline
testing
on
concussion
assessment
measures
in
1999
2000
and
2001
Ninety-four
players
with
concussion
(based
on
American
Academy
of
Neurology
criteria)
and
56
noninjured
controls
underwent
assessment
of
symptoms
cognitive
functioning
and
postural
stability
immediately
3
hours
and

No
player
with

was
excluded
from
participation
79

completed
the

Players
with

On

Mild
impairments
in
cognitive
processing
and
verbal
memory
evident
on
neuropsychological

2
days
after
concussion
resolved
by

There
were
no
significant
differences
in
symptoms
or
functional
impairments
in
the
concussion
and
control
groups
90
days
after
concussion
Collegiate
football
players
may
require
several
days
for
recovery
of
symptoms
cognitive
dysfunction
and
postural
instability
after
concussion
Further
research
is
required
to
determine
factors
that
predict
variability
in
recovery
time
after
concussion
Standardized
measurement
of
postconcussive
symptoms
cognitive
functioning
and
postural
stability
may
enhance
clinical
management
of
athletes
recovering
from
concussion
