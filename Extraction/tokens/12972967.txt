Title
Excision
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoid
under
local
anesthesia
a
retrospective
evaluation
of
340
patients
Abstract
Text
This
study
was
a
retrospective
analysis
of
complication
rates
symptom
recurrence
long-term
results
and
patient
satisfaction
after
outpatient
excision
(local
anesthesia)
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
From
1995
to
2000
340
patients
(166
males)
underwent
office-based
excision
of
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoids
under
local
anesthesia
Data
regarding
complications
operations
because
of
recurrence
residual
symptoms
patient's
satisfaction
with
anesthesia
and
wound
treatment
were
obtained
by
questionnaire
Response
was
solicited
at
a
minimum
of
9
months
postprocedure
Complete
follow-up
data
was
available
in
88
percent
of
patients
(mean
follow-up
173
months)
Recurrent
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoid
requiring
a
procedure
developed
in
22
(65
percent)
patients
Other
complications
that
required
operative
intervention
were
one
(03
percent)
incidence
of
postoperative
bleeding
and
seven
(21
percent)
perianal
abscess/fistula
The
majority
of
patients
(66
percent)
had
no
anal
complaints
at
follow-up
Local
anesthesia
would
be
preferred
if
a
repeat
excision
was
required
in
79
percent
whereas
11
percent
would
prefer
another
form
of
anesthesia
and
10
percent
were
unsure
Outpatient
excision
under
local
anesthesia
of
a
thrombosed
external
hemorrhoid
can
be
safely
performed
with
a
low
recurrence
and
complication
rate
while
offering
a
high
level
of
patient
of
acceptance
and
satisfaction
