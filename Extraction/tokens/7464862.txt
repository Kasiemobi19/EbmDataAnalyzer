Title
The
natural
history
of
unruptured
intracranial
aneurysms
Abstract
Text
This
study
defines
the
natural
history
of
a
selected
group
of
65
patients
with
81
unruptured
intracranial
saccular
aneurysms
who
did
not
undergo
surgery
Eight
of
the
65
patients
with
aneurysms
had
intracranial
hemorrhage
due
to
aneurysmal
rupture
over
a
mean
follow-up
interval
of
slightly
over
eight
years
We
performed
a
multivariate
discriminant
analysis
to
assess
the
relation
of
several
independent
variables
to
aneurysmal
ruptures
These
variables
included
age
sex
aneurysm
size
number
of
aneurysms
presence
of
multilobed
aneurysms
aneurysmal
symptoms
other
than
rupture
aneurysm
location
and
hypertension
at
or
before
the
identification
of
the
aneurysm
The
only
variable
of
unquestionable
significance
was
aneurysm
size
which
was
noted
in
73
instances
None
of
the
44
aneurysms
smaller
than
1
cm
in
diameter
ruptured
whereas
eight
of
the
29
aneurysms
1
cm
or
more
in
diameter
eventually
did
We
conclude
that
unruptured
intracranial
saccular
aneurysms
smaller
than
1
cm
in
diameter
have
a
very
low
probability
of
subsequent
rupture
