Diagnostic
efficacy

Abstract
Text
Magnetic
resonance
(MR)
imaging
has
proved
to
be
an
excellent
tool
in
diagnosing
injuries
of
the
cruciate
ligaments
and
menisci
However
multiple
planes
and
sometimes
optimal
oblique
or
double-oblique
scan
planes
are
needed
due
to
the
variability
in
the
positioning
of
important
structures
which
means
there
is
a
lower
throughput
and
longer
scanning
time
To
compare
the
performance
of
a
1-mm-thickness
fast
spin-echo
(FSE)
proton-density-weighted
(PDW)
MR
imaging
technique
with
multiplanar
reconstruction
(MPR)
in
diagnosing
tears
of
the
menisci
and
cruciate
ligaments
with
that
of
conventional
MR
imaging
Twenty-five
consecutive
patients
underwent
preoperative
conventional
and
1-mm-thickness
FSE
PDW
MR
imaging
with
subsequent
knee
arthroscopic
surgery
Two
musculoskeletal
radiologists
evaluated
the
status
of
the
cruciate
ligaments
and
menisci
using
two
sets
of
MR
images
(method
A
conventional
images
including
seven
sequences
taking
26
min
method
B
1-mm-thickness
FSE
PDW
images
with
MPR
taking
7
min
20
s)
The
diagnostic
efficacies
of
both
methods
for
tears
of
the
cruciate
ligament
and
menisci
were
calculated
and
compared
Arthroscopic
surgery
revealed
10
anterior
cruciate
ligament
(ACL)
tears
one
posterior
cruciate
ligament
(PCL)
tear
and
26
meniscal
tears
The
diagnostic
values
of
both
methods
were
100%
for
a
cruciate
ligament
tear
The
diagnostic
values
(sensitivity
specificity
accuracy
positive
predictive
value
and
negative
predictive
value)
for
meniscal
tears
were
90%
100%
96%
100%
and
94%
for
method
A
and
95%
100%
98%
100%
and
97%
for
method
B
respectively
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
diagnostic
values
between
methods
A
and
B

1-mm-slice-thickness
FSE
PDW
imaging
with
MPR
showed
comparable
performance
in
diagnosing
tears
of
the
cruciate
ligaments
and
menisci
to
conventional
sequences
but
the
scan
time
was
much
shorter
Therefore
this
technique
(method
B)
might
improve
the
throughput
of
a
3T
MR
imaging
system
