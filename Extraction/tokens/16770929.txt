Peripheral
vascular
disease
diagnosis
and
treatment
Abstract
Text
Peripheral
vascular
disease
is
a
manifestation
of
systemic
atherosclerosis
that
leads
to
significant
narrowing
of
arteries
distal
to
the
arch
of
the
aorta
The
most
common
symptom
of
peripheral
vascular
disease
is
intermittent
claudication
At
other
times
peripheral
vascular
disease
leads
to
acute
or
critical
limb
ischemia
Intermittent
claudication
manifests
as
pain
in
the
muscles
of
the
legs
with
exercise
it
is
experienced
by
2
percent
of
persons
older
than
65
years
Physical
findings
include
abnormal
pedal
pulses
femoral
artery
bruit
delayed
venous
filling
time
cool
skin
and
abnormal
skin
color
Most
patients
present
with
subtle
findings
and
lack
classic
symptoms
which
makes
the
diagnosis
difficult
The
standard
office-based
test
to
determine
the
presence
of
peripheral
vascular
disease
is
calculation
of
the
ankle-brachial
index
Magnetic
resonance
arteriography
duplex
scanning
and
hemodynamic
localization
are
noninvasive
methods
for
lesion
localization
and
may
be
helpful
when
symptoms
or
findings
do
not
correlate
with
the
ankle-brachial
index
Contrast
arteriography
is
used
for
definitive
localization
before
intervention
Treatment
is
divided
into
lifestyle
medical
and
surgical
therapies
Lifestyle
therapies
focus
on
exercise
smoking
cessation
and
dietary
modification
Medical
therapy
is
directed
at
reducing
platelet
aggregation
In
addition
patients
with
contributing
disorders
such
as
hypertension
diabetes
and
hyperlipidemia
need
to
have
these
conditions
managed
as
aggressively
as
possible
Surgical
therapies
include
stents
arterectomies
angioplasty
and
bypass
surgery
