Are
fibre
supplements
really
necessary
in
diverticular
disease
of
the
colon
A
controlled
clinical
trial
Abstract
Text
Fifty-eight
patients
with
uncomplicated
diverticular
disease
of
the
colon
took
bran
crispbread
ispaghula
drink
and
placebo
for
four
months
each
in
a
randomised
cross-over
double-blind
controlled
trial
Assessments
were
made
subjectively
using
a
monthly
self-administered
questionnaire
and
objectively
by
examining
a
seven-day
stool
collection
at
the
end
of
each
treatment
period
In
terms
of
a
pain
score
lower
bowel
symptom
score
(the
pain
score
and
sensation
of
incomplete
emptying
straining
stool
consistency
flatus
and
aperients
taken)
and
total
symptom
score
(belching
nausea
vomiting
dyspepsia
and
abdominal
distension)
fibre
supplementation
conferred
no
benefit
Symptoms
of
constipation
however
when
assessed
alone
were
significantly
relieved
Both
fibre
regimens
produced
the
expected
changes
in
stool
weight
consistency
and
frequency
It
is
concluded
that
dietary
fibre
supplements
in
the
commonly
used
doses
do
no
more
than
relieve
constipation
Perhaps
the
impression
that
fibre
helps
diverticular
disease
is
simply
a
manifestation
of
Western
civilisation's
obsession
with
the
need
for
regular
frequent
defecation
