Title
Interventions
for
treating
acute
and
chronic
Achilles
tendinitis
Abstract
Text
Achilles
tendinitis
is
one
of
the
most
common
of
all
sports
injuries
There
is
no
consensus
on
treatment
To
assess
the
effectiveness
of
various
treatment
interventions
for
acute
and
chronic
Achilles
tendinitis
in
adults
The
Cochrane
Musculoskeletal
Injuries
Group
specialised
register
(December
2000)
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
(The
Cochrane
Library
Issue
4
2000)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
December
2000)
EMBASE
(1980
to
2001
wk
04)
CINAHL
(1982
to
December
2000)
and
reference
lists
of
identified
trials
were
searched
Randomised
or
quasi-randomised
trials
of
treatment
interventions
for
acute
and
chronic
Achilles
tendinitis
in
adults
Studies
focusing
on
pathological
tendinitis
were
excluded
Excluded
were
those
trials
that
compared
different
dosages
of
the
same
drug
or
drugs
within
the
same
class
of
drugs
for
example
different
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs)
Three
reviewers
independently
assessed
trial
quality
by
use
of
a
ten
item
check
list
and
extracted
data
Requests
were
sent
for
separate
data
for
Achilles
tendinitis
patients
in
studies
within
trials
of
mixed
patient
populations
Where
possible
quantitative
analysis
and
limited
pooling
of
data
were
undertaken
Nine
trials
involving
697
patients
met
the
inclusion
criteria
of
the
review
Methodological
quality
was
adequate
in
most
of
the
trials
with
regards
to
blinding
but
the
assessment
of
outcome
was
incomplete
and
short-term
There
was
weak
but
not
robust
evidence
from
three
trials
of
a
modest
benefit
of
NSAIDs
for
the
alleviation
of
acute
symptoms
There
was
some
weak
evidence
of
no
difference
compared
with
no
treatment
of
low
dose
heparin
heel
pads
topical
laser
therapy
and
peritendonous
steroid
injection
but
this
could
not
be
fully
evaluated
from
the
reports
of
four
trials
The
results
of
an
experimental
preparation
of
a
calf-derived
deproteinized
haemodialysate
Actovegin
were
promising
but
the
severity
of
patient
symptoms
was
questionable
in
the
single
small
trial
testing
this
comparison
The
results
of
a
comparison
of
glycosaminoglycan
sulfate
with
a
NSAID
were
inconclusive
There
is
insufficient
evidence
from
randomised
controlled
trials
to
determine
which
method
of
treatment
is
the
most
appropriate
for
the
treatment
of
acute
or
chronic
Achilles
tendinitis
Further
research
is
warranted
