Oral
zinc
sulphate
in
the
treatment
of
recalcitrant
viral
warts
randomized
placebo-controlled
clinical
trial
Abstract
Text
Viral
warts
are
common
dermatological
diseases
although
the
rate
of
spontaneous
recovery
is
high
it
usually
takes
a
long
time
and
some
patients
might
not
show
this
spontaneous
healing
Zinc
has
an
important
effect
on
the
immune
system
and
it
has
been
used
as
an
immunomodulator
to
treat
a
variety
of
skin
disorders
To
assess
whether
oral
zinc
was
effective
in
treating
viral
warts
of
patients
evaluated
between
May
1999
and
April
2000
This
was
a
placebo-controlled
clinical
trial
Eighty
patients
with
viral
warts
(common
plantar
and
plane)
were
all
resistant
to
all
forms
of
treatment
Each
patient
had
>
15
warts
Forty
patients
were
treated
by
oral
zinc
sulphate
at
a
dose
of
10
mg
kg(-1)
daily
up
to
600
mg
day(-1)
and
followed-up
for
resolution
of
their
warts
and
for
any
evidence
of
recurrence
for
2-6
months
Another
40
patients
were
given
a
placebo
oral
treatment
in
the
form
of
glucose
and
followed-up
for
the
same
period
Only
23
patients
of
the
first
group
(zinc
treated)
and
20
patients
of
the
second
group
(placebo
treated)
completed
the
study
In
all
patients
the
serum
level
of
zinc
was
low
In
the
zinc-treated
group
the
overall
response
was
complete
clearance
of
warts
observed
in
20
patients
(869%)
after
2
months
of
treatment
Fourteen
patients
(609%)
showed
complete
disappearance
of
their
warts
after
1
month
Three
patients
(133%)
failed
to
respond
to
the
treatment
after
2
months
of
therapy
The
response
to
treatment
was
directly
related
to
the
increment
in
serum
zinc
level
No
patient
of
the
placebo-treated
group
showed
any
response
We
conclude
that
zinc
sulphate
at
a
dose
of
10
mg
kg(-1)
daily
seems
to
be
a
highly
efficacious
therapeutic
option
for
recalcitrant
viral
warts
and
proved
to
be
safe
with
few
adverse
effects
