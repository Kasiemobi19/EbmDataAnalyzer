Title
Closure
of
lacerations
and
incisions
with
octylcyanoacrylate
a
multicenter
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Most
lacerations
and
surgical
incisions
are
closed
with
sutures
or
staples
Octylcyanoacrylate
tissue
adhesive
(OCA)
was
recently
approved
for
use
in
the
United
States
We
compared
the
cosmetic
appearance
of
lacerations
and
incisions
repaired
with
OCA
versus
standard
wound
closure
methods
(SWC)
A
multicenter
randomized
clinical
trial
including
patients
with
simple
lacerations
or
surgical
incisions
was
conducted
at
10
clinical
sites
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
treatment
with
OCA
or
SWC
Follow-up
was
performed
at
1
week
and
at
3
months
to
determine
infection
rates
and
cosmetic
outcome
Eight
hundred
fourteen
patients
with
924
wounds
(383
traumatic
lacerations
235
excisions
of
skin
lesions
or
scar
revisions
208
minimally
invasive
surgeries
and
98
general
surgical
procedures)
were
enrolled
Groups
were
similar
in
baseline
characteristics
Wound
closure
with
OCA
was
faster
than
with
SWC
(29
vs
52
minutes
P
<001)
At
1
week
infection
rates
were
similar
(OCA
21%
vs
SWC
07%
P
=09)
and
fewer
OCA
wounds
were
erythematous
(18%
vs
36%
P
<001)
There
were
no
differences
in
wound
dehiscence
rates
(OCA
16%
vs
SWC
09%
P
=35)
At
3
months
there
was
no
difference
in
the
percent
of
wounds
with
optimal
appearance
(OCA
82%
vs
SWC
83%
P
=67)
Repair
of
traumatic
lacerations
and
surgical
incisions
with
OCA
is
faster
than
with
SWC
and
cosmetic
outcome
is
similar
at
3
months
