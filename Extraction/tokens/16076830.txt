Title
Duration
of
breastfeeding
and
risk
of
overweight
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Observational
studies
suggest
a
longer
duration
of
breastfeeding
to
be
associated
dose
dependently
with
a
decrease
in
risk
of
overweight
in
later
life
The
authors
performed
a
comprehensive
meta-analysis
of
the
existing
studies
on
duration
of
breastfeeding
and
risk
of
overweight
Studies
were
included
that
reported
the
odds
ratio
and
95%
confidence
interval
(or
the
data
to
calculate
them)
of
overweight
associated
with
breastfeeding
and
that
reported
the
duration
of
breastfeeding
and
used
exclusively
formula-fed
subjects
as
the
referent
Seventeen
studies
met
the
inclusion
criteria
By
meta-regression
the
duration
of
breastfeeding
was
inversely
associated
with
the
risk
of
overweight
(regression

Categorical

confirmed
this
dose-response

One
month
of
breastfeeding
was
associated
with
a
4%
decrease
in
risk
(OR=096/month
of
breastfeeding
95%

The
definitions
of
overweight
and
age
had
no
influence
These
findings
strongly
support
a
dose-dependent
association
between
longer
duration
of
breastfeeding
and
decrease
in
risk
of
overweight
