Abstract
Text
Markers
of
inflammation
such
as
C-reactive
protein
(CRP)
are
related
to
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
(CVD)
events
in
those
with
angina
but
little
is
known
about
individuals
without
prevalent
clinical
CVD
We
performed
a
prospective
nested
case-control
study
in
the
Cardiovascular
Health
Study
(CHS
5201
healthy
elderly
men
and
women)
Case
subjects
(n
=
146
men
and
women
with
incident
CVD
events
including
angina
myocardial
infarction
and
death)
and
control
subjects
(n
=
146)
were
matched
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
significant
subclinical
CVD
at
baseline
(average
follow-up
24
years)
In
women
but
not
men
the
mean
CRP
level
was
higher
for
case
subjects
than
for
control
subjects
(P
<
or
=
05)
In
general
CRP
was
higher
in
those
with
subclinical
disease
Most
of
the
association
of
CRP
with
female
case
subjects
versus
control
subjects
was
in
the
subgroup
with
subclinical
disease
333
versus
190
mg/L
P
<
05
adjusted
for
age
and
time
of
follow-up
Case-control
differences
were
greatest
when
the
time
between
baseline
and
the
CVD
event
was
shortest
The
strongest
associations
were
with
myocardial
infarction
and
there
was
an
overall
odds
ratio
for
incident
myocardial
infarction
for
men
and
women
with
subclinical
disease
(upper
quartile
versus
lower
three
quartiles)
of
267
(confidence
interval
[CI]
=
104
to
681)
with
the
relationship
being
stronger
in
women
(450
[CI
=
097
to
208])
than
in
men
(175
[CI
=
051
to
598])
We
performed
a
similar
study
in
the
Rural
Health
Promotion
Project
in
which
mean
values
of
CRP
were
higher
for
female
case
subjects
than
for
female
control
subjects
but
no
differences
were
apparent
for
men
Comparing
the
upper
quintile
with
the
lower
four
the
odds
ratio
for
CVD
case
subjects
was
27
(CI
=
110
to
660)
In
conclusion
CRP
was
associated
with
incident
events
in
the
elderly
especially
in
those
with
subclinical
disease
at
baseline
