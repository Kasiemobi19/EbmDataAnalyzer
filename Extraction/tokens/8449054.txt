Abstract
Text
The
efficacy
and
safety
of
orally
administered
clarithromycin
and
erythromycin
in
the
treatment
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
were
assessed
in
a
multicenter
double-blind
randomized
study
Two
hundred
sixty-eight
patients
were
randomized
to
receive
either
clarithromycin
250
mg
twice
a
day
or
erythromycin
stearate
500
mg
4
times
a
day
for
7
to
14
days
Efficacy
was
evaluable
in
173
patients
(92
for
clarithromycin
81
for
erythromycin)
No
statistically
significant
difference
in
clinical
success
rate
(cure
or
improvement)
was
observed
between
the
two
groups
(clarithromycin
97
percent
erythromycin
96
percent)
Both
groups
had
identical
radiologic
response
(97
percent
with
resolution
or
improvement)
Similarly
no
statistically
significant
difference
in
bacteriologic
response
toward
the
target
pathogens
was
observed
among
evaluable
patients
(clarithromycin
23/26
erythromycin
17/17
p
value
=
0287)
Clinical
response
toward
Mycoplasma
and
Chlamydia
pneumonia
was
comparable
between
the
two
groups
(clarithromycin
15/16
erythromycin
10/11)
However
patients
receiving
erythromycin
had
a
twofold
higher
incidence
of
adverse
events
mostly
related
to
the
gastrointestinal
system
and
were
five
times
more
likely
to
withdraw
from
therapy
because
of
drug-related
adverse
events
These
results
show
that
clarithromycin
is
as
effective
as
erythromycin
in
the
outpatient
treatment
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
Furthermore
the
lower
incidence
of
adverse
events
associated
with
clarithromycin
indicates
that
it
is
more
acceptable
to
patients
and
therefore
can
enhance
compliance
