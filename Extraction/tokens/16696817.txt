Title
Pilot
study
of
the
efficacy
of
renzapride
on
gastrointestinal
motility
and
symptoms
in
patients
with
constipation-predominant
irritable
bowel
syndrome
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
renzapride
a
potent
5-hydroxytryptamine
type-4
receptor
full
agonist
and
5-hydroxytryptamine
type-3
receptor
antagonist
in
patients
with
constipation-predominant
irritable
bowel
syndrome
In
this
dose-escalating
pilot
study
17
patients
with
constipation-predominant
irritable
bowel
syndrome
received
placebo
renzapride
2
mg
od
and
renzapride
2
mg
bd
sequentially
for
28
days
Response
was
determined
by
radio-opaque
marker
measurement
of
overall
gastrointestinal
and
segmental
colonic
transit
and
patients'
assessment
of
their
irritable
bowel
syndrome
symptoms
Renzapride
reduced
mean
overall
gastrointestinal
transit
time
(placebo
29
+/-
16
days
renzapride
2
mg
od
26
+/-
14
days
renzapride
2
mg
bd
19
+/-
16
days)
(P
=
0024)
and
accelerated
segmental
colonic
transit
with
statistically
significant
differences
for
renzapride
2
mg
bd
over
placebo
in
caecum/ascending
colon
(P
=
0019)
and
descending
colon
(P
=
0022)
Renzapride
also
reduced
abdominal
pain
increased
the
number
of
pain-free
days
and
improved
stool
consistency
The
frequency
of
reported
adverse
events
was
similar
on
renzapride
and
placebo
Renzapride
is
well-tolerated
stimulates
gastrointestinal
transit
and
improves
symptoms
in
patients
with
constipation-predominant
irritable
bowel
syndrome
particularly
at
the
2
mg
bd
dose
where
improvements
in
gastrointestinal
symptoms
were
evident
over
placebo
This
study
has
established
proof
of
concept
and
supports
further
investigation
of
renzapride
in
patients
with
constipation-predominant
irritable
bowel
syndrome
