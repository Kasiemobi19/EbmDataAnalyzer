Effectiveness
of
treatments
for
infantile
colic
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
diets
drug
treatment
and
behavioural
interventions
on
infantile
colic
in
trials
with
crying
or
the
presence
of
colic
as
the
primary
outcome
measure
Controlled
clinical
trials
identified
by
a
highly
sensitive
search
strategy
in
Medline
(1966-96)
Embase
(1986-95)
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Register
in
combination
with
reference
checking
for
further
relevant
publications
Keywords
were
crying
and
colic
Two
independent
assessors
selected
controlled
trials
with
interventions
lasting
at
least
3
days
that
included
infants
younger
than
6
months
who
cried
excessively
Methodological
quality
was
assessed
by
two
assessors
independently
with
a
quality
assessment
scale
(range
0-5)
Effect
sizes
were
calculated
as
percentage
success
Effect
sizes
of
trials
using
identical
interventions
were
pooled
using
a
random
effects
model
27
controlled
trials
were
identified
Elimination
of
cows'
milk
protein
was
effective
when
substituted
by
hypoallergenic
formula
milks
(effect
size
022
(95%
confidence
interval
009
to
034))
The
effectiveness
of
substitution
by
soy
formula
milks
was
unclear
when
only
trials
of
good
methodological
quality
were
considered
The
benefit
of
eliminating
cows'
milk
protein
was
not
restricted
to
highly
selected
populations
Dicyclomine
was
effective
(effect
size
046
(033
to
060))
but
serious
side
effects
have
been
reported
The
advice
to
reduce
stimulation
was
beneficial
(effect
size
048
(023
to
074))
whereas
the
advice
to
increase
carrying
and
holding
seemed
not
to
reduce
crying
No
benefit
was
shown
for
simethicone
Uncertainty
remained
about
the
effectiveness
of
low
lactose
formula
milks
Infantile
colic
should
preferably
be
treated
by
advising
carers
to
reduce
stimulation
and
with
a
one
week
trial
of
a
hypoallergenic
formula
milk
