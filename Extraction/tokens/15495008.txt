Title
Psychosocial
and
psychological
interventions
for
preventing
postpartum
depression
Abstract
Text
The
cause
of
postpartum
depression
remains
unclear
with
extensive
research
suggesting
a
multi-factorial
aetiology
However
epidemiological
studies
and
meta-analyses
of
predictive
studies
have
consistently
demonstrated
the
importance
of
psychosocial
and
psychological
variables
While
interventions
based
on
these
variables
may
be
effective
treatment
strategies
theoretically
they
may
also
be
used
in
pregnancy
and
the
early
postpartum
period
to
prevent
postpartum
depression
Primary
to
assess
the
effect
of
diverse
psychosocial
and
psychological
interventions
compared
with
usual
antepartum
intrapartum
or
postpartum
care
to
reduce
the
risk
of
developing
postpartum
depression
Secondary
to
examine
(1)
the
effectiveness
of
specific
types
of
psychosocial
and
psychological
interventions
(2)
the
effectiveness
of
individual
versus
group-based
interventions
(3)
the
effects
of
intervention
onset
and
duration
and
(4)
whether
interventions
are
more
effective
in
women
selected
with
specific
risk
factors
We
searched
the
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group
trials
register
(January
27
2004)
the
Cochrane
Depression
Anxiety
and
Neurosis
Group
trials
register
(October
2003)
the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(October
2003)
MEDLINE
(1966
to
2004)
EMBASE
(1980
to
2004)
and
CINAHL
(1982
to
2004)
We
scanned
secondary
references
and
contacted
experts
in
the
field
All
published
and
unpublished
randomised
controlled
trials
of
acceptable
quality
comparing
a
psychosocial
or
psychological
intervention
with
usual
antenatal
intrapartum
or
postpartum
care
Both
reviewers
participated
in
the
evaluation
of
methodological
quality
and
data
extraction
Additional
information
was
sought
from
several
trial
researchers
Results
are
presented
using
relative
risk
for
categorical
data
and
weighted
mean
difference
for
continuous
data
Fifteen
trials
involving
over
7600
women
were
included
Overall
women
who
received
a
psychosocial
intervention
were
equally
likely
to
develop
postpartum
depression
as
those
receiving
standard
care
(relative
risk
(RR)
081
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
065
to
102)
One
promising
intervention
appears
to
be
the
provision
of
intensive
postpartum
support
provided
by
public
health
nurses
or
midwives
(RR
068
95%
CI
055
to
084)
Identifying
mothers
'at-risk'
assisted
the
prevention
of
postpartum
depression
(RR
067
95%
CI
051
to
089)
Interventions
with
only
a
postnatal
component
appeared
to
be
more
beneficial
(RR
076
95%
CI
058
to
098)
than
interventions
that
also
incorporated
an
antenatal
component
While
individually-based
interventions
may
be
more
effective
(RR
076
95%
CI
059
to
100)
than
those
that
are
group-based
women
who
received
multiple-contact
intervention
were
just
as
likely
to
experience
postpartum
depression
as
those
who
received
a
single-contact
intervention
Overall
psychosocial
interventions
do
not
reduce
the
numbers
of
women
who
develop
postpartum
depression
However
a
promising
intervention
is
the
provision
of
intensive
professionally-based
postpartum
support
