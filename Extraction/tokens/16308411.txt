Abstract
Text
To
compare
two
treatments
in
common
usage
for
children
with
atopic
eczema
"wet
wrap"
bandages
versus
conventional
topically
applied
ointments
A
total
of
50
children
(age
4-27
months)
with
moderate
to
severe
eczema
were
randomised
to
one
or
other
treatment
Two
research
nurses
supervised
the
study
The
first
gave
advice
and
support
and
the
second
blinded
to
the
treatment
modality
being
used
scored
the
change
in
eczema
severity
over
a
period
of
four
weeks
using
the
SCORAD
eczema
severity
scale
Both
treatments
gave
a
benefit
in
overall
SCORAD
scores
(mean
change
for
wet
wrap
group
was
53
to
24
for
the
conventional
group
41
to
17)
There
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
two
groups
in
terms
of
overall
improvement
at
four
weeks
or
in
the
timescale
of
improvements
The
amount
of
topical
of
topical
steroid
used
was
similar
in
both
groups
The
wet
wrap
group
suffered
significantly
more
skin
infections
requiring
antibiotics
Carers
reported
that
wet
wraps
were
less
easy
to
apply
than
conventional
treatment
