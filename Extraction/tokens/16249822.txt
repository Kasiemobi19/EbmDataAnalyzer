An
efficient
method
of
identifying
major
depression
and
panic
disorder
in
primary
care
Abstract
Text
The
research
literature
is
replete
with
evidence
of
and
concerns
about
the
prevalence
and
undertreatment
of
mental
disorders
in
primary
care
Although
screening
on
its
own
may
not
directly
affect
clinical
outcomes
it
is
still
the
most
efficient
and
effective
way
to
identify
psychologically
distressed
patients
for
either
research
purposes
or
to
provide
patients
with
or
refer
patients
to
appropriate
care
The
current
study
sought
to
establish
the
utility
of
the
MHI-5
for
the
detection
of
patients
suffering
from
major
depression
or
panic
disorder
two
of
the
most
common
psychiatric
conditions
seen
in
primary
care
settings
This
study
was
conducted
in
a
family
medicine
clinic
and
246
adult
outpatients
participated
Patients
completed
the
Mental
Health
Index-5
(MHI-5)
as
the
screening
measure
and
the
PRIME-MD
Patient
Health
Questionnaire
(PHQ)
as
the
diagnostic
instrument
ROC
analyses
indicated
that
a
cut-off
score
of
23
on
the
MHI-5
yielded
a
sensitivity
of
91%
and
a
specificity
of
58%
for
predicting
provisional
diagnoses
of
major
depression
or
panic
disorder
from
the
PHQ
Using
a
single
item
to
screen
for
a
PHQ
diagnosis
of
major
depression
yielded
a
sensitivity
of
88%
and
a
specificity
of
62%
and
a
second
question
had
a
sensitivity
of
100%
and
specificity
of
63%
for
PHQ
diagnosis
of
panic
disorder
These
results
indicate
that
it
is
possible
to
use
a
small
number
of
items
to
efficiently
and
effectively
screen
for
mental
disorders
affecting
a
significant
portion
of
primary
care
patients
