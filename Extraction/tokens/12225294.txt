Title
Ultrasonographic
endometrial
thickness
for
diagnosing
endometrial
pathology
in
women
with
postmenopausal
bleeding
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Our
aim
was
to
determine
the
diagnostic
accuracy
of
endometrial
thickness
measurement
by
pelvic
ultrasonography
for
predicting
endometrial
carcinoma
and
disease
(hyperplasia
and/or
carcinoma)
during
an
investigation
of
postmenopausal
bleeding
We
performed
a
systematic
quantitative
review
of
the
available
published
literature
which
consisted
of
online
searching
the
MEDLINE
and
EMBASE
databases
(1966-2000)
coupled
with
scanning
of
bibliography
of
known
primary
and
review
articles
The
selection
of
studies
assessment
of
study
quality
and
extraction
of
data
were
performed
in
duplicate
under
masked
conditions
Included
in
the
analyses
were
57
studies
with
9031
patients
Accuracy
data
were
summarized
using
likelihood
ratios
for
various
cut-off
levels
of
abnormal
endometrial
thickness
The
commonest
cut-offs
were
4
mm
(9
studies)
and
5
mm
(21
studies)
measuring
both
endometrial
layers
None
of
the
nine
studies
using
the
<
or
=
4
mm
cut-off
level
were
of
good
quality
Only
four
studies
(out
of
the
21)
used
the
<
or
=
5
mm
cut-off
level
which
employed
the
best-quality
criteria
Using
the
pooled
estimates
from
these
four
studies
only
a
positive
test
result
raised
the
probability
of
carcinoma
from
140%
(95%
CI
133-147)
to
313%
(95%
CI
261-363)
while
a
negative
test
reduced
it
to
25%
(95%
CI
09-64)
In
conclusion
ultrasound
measurement
of
endometrial
thickness
alone
using
the
best-quality
studies
cannot
be
used
to
accurately
rule
However
a
negative
result
at
<
or
=
5
mm
cut-off
level
measuring
both
endometrial
layers
in
the
presence
of
endometrial
pathology
rules
out
endometrial
pathology
with
good
certainty
