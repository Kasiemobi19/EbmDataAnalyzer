Clinical
effectiveness
of
pneumococcal
vaccine
Meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
clinical
effectiveness
of
pneumococcal
vaccine
Computerized
searches
of
MEDLINE
EMBASE
and
SCISEARCH
databases
were
performed
reference
lists
of
retrieved
articles
were
reviewed
and
first
authors
of
published
studies
were
contacted
Studies
of
use
of
pneumococcal
vaccines
in
adults
were
included
if
the
study
design
was
a
randomized
or
quasi-randomized
controlled
trial
and
at
least
one
of
the
following
clinical
outcomes
was
reported
vaccine-type
systemic
pneumococcal
infection
systemic
pneumococcal
infection
vaccine-type
pneumococcal
pneumonia
pneumococcal
pneumonia
non-vaccine-type
pneumococcal
pneumonia
Study
quality
was
assessed
and
descriptive
information
concerning
the
study
populations
interventions
and
outcome
measurements
was
extracted
for
13
trials
involving
more
than
65000
patients
Estimates
of
vaccine
efficacy
based
on
a
meta-analysis
of
randomized
and
quasi-randomized
trials
were
determined
for
clinical
outcomes
Vaccination
with
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
can
be
expected
to
reduce
the
risk
of
systemic
infection
due
to
pneumococcal
types
included
in
the
vaccine
by
83%
and
systemic
infection
due
to
all
pneumococci
by
73%
We
found
no
evidence
that
the
vaccine
was
less
efficacious
for
the
elderly
institutionalized
people
or
those
with
chronic
disease
