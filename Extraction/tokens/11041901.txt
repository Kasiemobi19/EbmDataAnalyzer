New
transient
ischemic
attack
and
stroke
outpatient
management
by
primary

physicians
Abstract
Text
Patients
with
transient
ischemic
attack
(TIA)
or
stroke
frequently
first
contact
their
primary
care
physician
rather
than
seeking
care
at
a
hospital
emergency
department
The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
a
group
of
patients
seen
by
primary
care
physicians
in
an
office
setting
for
a
first-ever
TIA
or
stroke
and
characterize
their
evaluation
and
management
Practice
audit
based
on
retrospective
structured
medical
record
abstraction
from
27
primary
care
medical
practices
in
2
geographically
separate
communities
in
the
eastern
United
States
Ninety-five
patients
with
a
first-ever
TIA
and
81
with
stroke
were
identified
Seventy-nine
percent
of
those
with
TIA
vs
88%
with
stroke
were
evaluated
on
the
day
their
symptoms
occurred
(P
=12)
Only
6%
were
admitted
to
a
hospital
for
evaluation
and
treatment
on
the
day
of
the
index
visit
(2%
TIA
10%
stroke
P
=03)
only
an
additional
3%
were
admitted
during
the
subsequent
30
days
Specialists
were
consulted
for
45%
of
patients
A
brain
imaging
study
(computed
tomography
or
magnetic
resonance
imaging)
was
ordered
on
the
day
of
the
index
visit
in
30%
(23%
TIA
37%
stroke
P
=04)
regardless
of
whether
the
patient
was
referred
to
a
specialist
Carotid
ultrasound
studies
were
obtained
in
28%
(40%
TIA
14%
stroke
P<001)
electrocardiograms
in
19%
(18%
TIA
21%
stroke
P
=60)
and
echocardiograms
in
16%
(19%
TIA
14%
stroke
P
=34)
Fewer
than
half
of
patients
with
a
prior
history
of
atrial
fibrillation
(n
=
24)
underwent
anticoagulation
when
evaluated
at
the
index
visit
Thirty-two
percent
of
patients
(31%
TIA
33%
stroke
P
=70)
were
not
hospitalized
and
had
no
evaluations
performed
during
the
first
month
after
presenting
to
a
primary
care
physician
with
a
first
TIA
or
stroke
Of
these
patients
59%
had
a
change
in
antiplatelet
therapy
on
the
day
of
the
index
visit
Further
primary
care
physician
education
regarding
the
importance
of
promptly
and
fully
evaluating
patients
with
TIA
or
stroke
may
be
warranted
and
barriers
to
implementation
of
established
secondary
stroke
prevention
strategies
need
to
be
carefully
explored
