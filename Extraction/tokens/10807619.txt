Randomised

fluticasone

the

trial
Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
effect
of
long
term
inhaled
corticosteroids
on
lung
function
exacerbations
and
health
status
in
patients
with
moderate
to
severe
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
Double
blind
placebo
controlled
study
Eighteen
UK
hospitals
Participants
751
men
and
women
aged
between
40
and
75
years
with
mean
forced
expiratory
volume
in
one
second
(FEV(1))
50%
of
predicted
normal
Interventions
Inhaled
fluticasone
propionate
500
microgram
twice
daily
from
a
metered
dose
inhaler
or
identical
placebo
Main
outcome
measures
Efficacy
measures
rate
of
decline
in
FEV(1)
after
the
bronchodilator
and
in
health
status
frequency
of
exacerbations
respiratory
withdrawals
Safety
measures
morning
serum
cortisol
concentration
incidence
of
adverse
events
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
annual
rate
of
decline
in
FEV(1
)(P=016)
Mean
FEV(1)
after
bronchodilator
remained
significantly
higher
throughout
the
study
with
fluticasone
propionate
compared
with
placebo
(P<0001)
Median
exacerbation
rate
was
reduced
by
25%
from
132
a
year
on
placebo
to
099
a
year
on
with
fluticasone
propionate
(P=0026)
Health
status
deteriorated
by
32
units
a
year
on
placebo
and
20
units
a
year
on
fluticasone
propionate
(P=00043)
Withdrawals
because
of
respiratory
disease
not
related
to
malignancy
were
higher
in
the
placebo
group
(25%
v
19%
P=0034)
Fluticasone
propionate
500
microgram
twice
daily
did
not
affect
the
rate
of
decline
in
FEV(1)
but
did
produce
a
small
increase
in
FEV(1)
Patients
on
fluticasone
propionate
had
fewer
exacerbations
and
a
slower
decline
in
health
status
These
improvements
in
clinical
outcomes
support
the
use
of
this
treatment
in
patients
with
moderate
to
severe
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
