Monitoring
weight
daily
blocks
the
freshman
weight
gain
a
model
for
combating
the
epidemic
of
obesity
Abstract
Text
The
Tissue
Monitoring
System
(TMS)
is
an
algorithm
that
estimates
changes
in
body
tissue
from
a
series
of
daily
weight
measures
It
is
intended
to
provide
people
with
a
feedback
of
changes
in
their
tissue
weight
so
they
may
have
a
basis
for
estimating
how
much
they
would
have
to
change
their
intake
or
expenditure
to
maintain
their
weight
at
a
prescribed
level
We
tested
the
effectiveness
of
the
TMS
to
prevent
freshmen
from
gaining
weight
during
their
first
semester
in
college
In
two
similar
but
independent
studies
(Fall
2002
2003)
female
freshmen
college
students
were
given
analog
bathroom
scales
and
instructed
to
weigh
themselves
each
morning
immediately
after
rising
from
bed
then
e-mail
their
weight
to
our
staff
After
7
days
a
linear
function
was
performed
on
the
most
recent
7
days
of
the
weight-day
function
for
each
participant
In
the
first
study
the
slope
of
this
function
was
e-mailed
back
to
the
participants
In
the
second
study
the
difference
between
last
point
and
the
original
weight
was
determined
using
linear
regression
techniques
converted
to
calories
and
the
information
was
e-mailed
back
to
the
participants
Control
participants
in
both
studies
were
weighed
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
semester
The
untreated
controls
gained
31+/-051
kg
and
20+/-065
kg
respectively
(P<001
for
both
studies)
whereas
weight
gain
of
the
experimental
groups
was
01+/-099
kg
and
-082+/-056
kg
values
that
were
not
significantly
different
than
zero
The
TMS
appears
to
be
an
effective
technique
to
help
female
college
freshmen
resist
gaining
weight
in
an
environment
that
is
conducive
to
weight
gain
These
results
suggest
that
the
TMS
may
be
a
useful
method
to
help
curb
the
slow
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
overweight
and
obesity
that
is
characteristic
of
all
industrialized
societies
