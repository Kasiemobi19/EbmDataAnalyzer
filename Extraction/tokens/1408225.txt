The

for

of
benign

vertigo
Abstract
Text
The
Canalith
Repositioning
Procedure
(CRP)
is
designed
to
treat
benign
paroxysmal
positional
vertigo
(BPPV)
through
induced
out-migration
of
free-moving
pathological
densities
in
the
endolymph
of
a
semicircular
canal
using
timed
head
maneuvers
and
applied
vibration
This
article
describes
the
procedure
and
its
rationale
and
reports
the
results
in
30
patients
who
exhibited
the
classic
nystagmus
of
BPPV
with
Hallpike
maneuvers
CRP
obtained
timely
resolution
of
the
nystagmus
and
positional
vertigo
in
100%
Of
these
10%
continued
to
have
atypical
symptoms
suggesting
concomitant
pathology
30%
experienced
one
or
more
recurrences
but
responded
well
to
retreatment
with
CRP
These
results
also
support
an
alternative
theory
that
the
densities
that
impart
gravity-sensitivity
to
a
semicircular
canal
in
BPPV
are
free
in
the
canal
rather
than
attached
to
the
cupula
CRP
offers
significant
advantages
over
invasive
and
other
noninvasive
treatment
modalities
in
current
use
