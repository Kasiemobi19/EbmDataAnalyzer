Transvaginal
sonography
of
the
endometrium
in
postmenopausal
women
monitoring
the
effect
of
hormone
replacement
therapy
Abstract
Text
BACKGROUND
It
is
well
known
that
progestins
given
in
sufficient
dosage
reduce
the
risk
of
endometrial
cancer
and
endometrial
hyperplasia
It
is
also
not
uncommon
that
patients
receiving
hormone
replacement
therapy
(HRT)
require
endometrial
biopsy
in
order
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
oestrogens
and
progestogens
on
endometrium
However
endometrial
biopsy
is
often
associated
with
pain
and
discomfort
and
transvaginal
sonography
has
been
suggested
as
a
new
and
painless
method
of
monitoring
the
effects
of
HRT
on
the
endometrium
METHODS
Transvaginal
ultrasonography
was
performed
in
a
series
of
women
on
several
regimens
of
HRT
immediately
prior
to
endometrial
biopsy
(Cornier
cannula)
We
correlated
the
morphology
and
thickness
of
the
endometrium
as
assessed
by
transvaginal
ultrasonography
with
the
endometrial
histology
Patients
were
assigned
into
four
groups
The
first
(n
=
15)
received
06
mg/day
of
conjugated
equine
oestrogen
(CEE)
cyclically
and
the
second
(n
=
6)
received
50
micrograms/day
of
transdermal
oestradiol
cyclically
All
these
groups
also
received
5
mg
of
medroxy-progesterone
acetate
(MPA)
sequentially
for
the
last
12
days
of
HRT
while
the
third
therapy
group
(n
=
7)
received
0625
mg/day
of
CEE
and
5
mg/day
of
MPA
uninterruptedly
The
fourth
group
(n
=
8)
constituted
a
treatment-free
control
group
In
total
36
biopsies
were
taken
Our
initial
results
suggest
that
endometrial
thickness
under
4
mm
measured
by
ultrasonography
is
not
associated
with
endometrial
abnormalities
and
that
transvaginal
ultrasonographic
scanning
of
the
endometrium
may
be
a
useful
tool
in
determining
which
patients
require
endometrial
histologic
evaluation
and
perhaps
in
detecting
those
who
need
adjustment
in
the
progestin
dosage
