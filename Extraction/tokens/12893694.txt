Red
flags
in
patients
presenting
with
headache
clinical
indications
for
neuroimaging
Abstract
Text
Headache
is
a
very
common
patient
complaint
but
secondary
causes
for
headache
are
unusual
Neuroimaging
is
both
expensive
and
has
a
low
yield
in
this
group
Most
patients
with
intracranial
pathology
have
clinical
features
that
would
raise
a
"red
flag"
Appropriate
selection
of
patients
with
headache
for
neuroimaging
to
look
for
secondary
causes
is
very
important
Red
flags
act
as
screening
tools
to
help
in
identifying
those
patients
presenting
with
headache
who
would
benefit
from
prompt
neuroimaging
and
may
increase
the
yield
The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
evaluate
clinical
features
in
patients
with
headache
using
neuroimaging
as
a
screening
tool
for
intracranial
pathology
20
red
flags
were
defined
A
retrospective
study
of
111
patients
was
performed
and
the
outcomes
were
divided
into
positive
and
negative
Abnormal
neuroimaging
was
present
in
39
patients
Results
were
analysed
using
the
Logistic
Regression
model
Sensitivity
and
specificity
of
red
flags
were
analysed
to
establish
the
cut-off
point
to
predict
abnormal
neuroimaging
and
a
receiver
operating
characteristic
(ROC)
curve
plotted
to
show
the
sensitivity
of
the
diagnostic
test
Three
red
flag
features
proved
to
be
statistically
significant
with
the
p-value
of
less
than
005
on
both
univariate
and
multivariate
analysis
These
were
paralysis
papilloedema
and
"drowsiness
confusion
memory
impairment
and
loss
of
consciousness"
In
addition
if
three
or
more
red
flags
from
the
list
were
present
this
showed
strong
indication
of
abnormal
neuroimaging
from
cut-off
point
of
ROC
curve
(area
under
the
curve
=076)
