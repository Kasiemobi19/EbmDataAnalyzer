Title
Utility
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
in
premature
ejaculation
Abstract
Text
The
introduction
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
has
revolutionized
our
understanding
of
the
treatment
of
premature
ejaculation
Lifelong
premature
ejaculation
may
be
a
neurobiological
phenomenon
namely
part
of
a
biological
variability
of
the
intravaginal
ejaculation
latency
time
in
men
Animal
studies
support
this
view
and
an
animal
model
for
premature
and
delayed
ejaculation
has
recently
been
developed
It
is
proposed
that
drug
treatment
of
premature
ejaculation
should
consist
of
5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-HT)2c
receptor
stimulation
and/or
5-HT1A
receptor
inhibition
A
meta-analysis
of
35
daily
treatment
studies
with
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
and
clomipramine
demonstrated
comparable
efficacy
of
clomipramine
with
the
SSRIs
sertraline
and
fluoxetine
in
delaying
ejaculation
whereas
the
efficacy
of
the
SSRI
paroxetine
was
greater
than
all
other
SSRIs
and
clomipramine
It
is
postulated
that
acute
treatment
with
SSRIs
including
those
with
short
half-lives
will
not
produce
an
ejaculation
delay
equivalent
to
that
induced
by
daily
treatment
of
SSRIs
