Randomised
controlled
trial
of
faecal-occult-blood
screening
for
colorectal
cancer
Abstract
Text
There
is
growing
evidence
that
faecal-occult-blood
(FOB)
screening
may
reduce
colorectal
cancer
(CRC)
mortality
but
this
reduction
in
CRC
mortality
has
not
been
shown
in
an
unselected
population-based
randomised
controlled
trial
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
effect
of
FOB
screening
on
CRC
mortality
in
such
a
setting
Between
February
1981
and
January
1991
152850
people
aged
45-74
years
who
lived
in
the
Nottingham
area
of
the
UK
were
recruited
to
our
study
Participants
were
randomly
allocated
FOB
screening
(76466)
or
no
screening
(controls
76384)
Controls
were
not
told
about
the
study
and
received
no
intervention
Screening-group
participants
were
sent
a
Haemoccult
FOB
test
kit
with
instructions
from
their
family
doctor
FOB
tests
were
not
rehydrated
and
dietary
restrictions
were
imposed
only
for
retesting
borderline
results
Individuals
with
negative
FOB
tests
at
the
first
screening
together
with
those
who
tested
positive
but
in
whom
no
neoplasia
was
found
on
colonoscopy
were
invited
to
take
part
in
further
screening
every
2
years
Screening
was
stopped
in
February
1995
by
which
time
screening-group
participants
had
been
offered
FOB
tests
between
three
and
six
times
Screening-group
participants
who
had
a
positive
test
were
offered
full
colonoscopy
All
participants
were
followed
up
until
June
1995
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
CRC
mortality
Of
the
152850
individuals
recruited
to
the
study
2599
could
not
be
traced
or
had
emigrated
and
were
excluded
from
the
analysis
Thus
there
were
75253
participants
in
the
screening
group
and
74998
controls
44838
(596%)
screening-group
participants
completed
at
least
one
screening
28720
(382%)
of
these
individuals
completed
all
the
FOB
tests
they
were
offered
and
16118
(214%)
completed
at
least
one
screening
but
not
all
the
tests
they
were
offered
30415
(404%)
did
not
complete
any
test
Of
893
cancers
(20%
stage
A)
diagnosed
in
screening-group
participants
(CRC
incidence
of
149
per
1000
person-years)
236
(264%)
were
detected
by
FOB
screening
249
(279%)
presented
after
a
negative
FOB
test
or
investigation
and
400
(448%)
presented
in
non-responders
The
incidence
of
cancer
in
the
control
group
(856
cases
11%
stage
A)
was
144
per
1000
person-years
Median
follow-up
was
78
years
(range
45-145)
360
people
died
from
CRC
in
the
screening
group
compared
with
420
in
the
control
group-a
15%
reduction
in
cumulative
CRC
mortality
in
the
screening
group
(odds
ratio=085
[95%
CI
074-098]
p
=
0026)
Our
findings
together
with
evidence
from
other
trials
suggest
that
consideration
should
be
given
to
a
national
programme
of
FOB
screening
to
reduce
CRC
mortality
in
the
general
population
