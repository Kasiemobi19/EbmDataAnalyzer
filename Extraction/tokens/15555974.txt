The
timing
of
elective
colectomy
in
diverticulitis
a
decision
analysis
Abstract
Text
Determining
the
optimal
strategy
for
elective
colectomy
in
patients
with
diverticular
disease
involves
a
balance
of
the
morbidity
mortality
costs
and
quality
of
life
associated
with
both
elective
and
expectant
management
We
used
decision
and
cost
analysis
to
simulate
the
clinical
and
economic
outcomes
after
recovery
from
an
episode
of
nonsurgically
treated
diverticulitis
to
determine
the
preferable
management
strategy
A
Markov
model
was
constructed
to
evaluate
lifetime
risks
of
death
and
colostomy
care
costs
and
quality
of
life
associated
with
elective
colectomy
after
subsequent
episodes
of
diverticulitis
The
analysis
was
from
the
payer's
perspective
using
hypothetical
cohorts
of
35-
and
50-year-old
patients
who
recovered
from
a
nonsurgically
treated
diverticulitis
episode
Probabilities
of
clinical
events
and
costs
for
the
base-case
analysis
were
derived
from
a
large
cohort
using
a
statewide
administrative
database
and
published
estimates
Performing
colectomy
after
the
fourth
rather
than
the
second
episode
in
patients
older
than
50
years
resulted
in
05%
fewer
deaths
07%
fewer
colostomies
and
saved
US
1035
dollars
per
patient
In
younger
patients
performing
colectomy
after
the
fourth
episode
compared
with
the
first
episode
resulted
in
01%
fewer
deaths
2%
fewer
colostomies
and
saved
US
5429
dollars
per
patient
Expectant
management
through
three
recurrent
episodes
with
elective
colectomy
after
the
fourth
episode
was
the
dominant
strategy
across
the
full
range
of
the
variables
tested
in
the
sensitivity
analysis
compared
with
earlier
intervention
This
study
suggests
that
expectant
management
is
associated
with
lower
rates
of
death
and
colostomy
and
is
cost-saving
for
both
younger
and
older
patients
