Albuterol
delivered
by
metered-dose
inhaler
to
treat
acute
bronchitis
Abstract
Text
Previous
research
has
suggested
that
cough
associated
with
acute
bronchitis
is
more
likely
to
subside
within
7
days
when
treated
with
albuterol
than
with
an
antibiotic
This
study
examines
the
effectiveness
of
aerosolized
albuterol
for
the
treatment
of
acute
bronchitis
in
patients
treated
with
erythromycin
or
placebo
A
double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
trial
of
albuterol
delivered
by
metered-dose
inhaler
(MDI)
was
conducted
in
a
primary
care
setting
with
healthy
adult
patients
who
presented
with
a
productive
cough
of
fewer
than
30
days'
duration
In
addition
to
randomization
for
albuterol
patients
were
also
randomized
to
receive
erythromycin
or
placebo
Outcomes
were
assessed
at
follow-up
after
7
days
Patients
treated
with
albuterol
MDI
were
less
likely
to
be
coughing
after
7
days
of
treatment
than
were
patients
using
a
placebo
inhaler
(61%
still
coughing
vs
91%
P
=
02)
When
analysis
was
stratified
by
cigarette
smoking
status
and
the
use
of
erythromycin
the
differences
observed
between
albuterol
MDI
patients
and
controls
persisted
Albuterol
appears
to
reduce
the
likelihood
that
patients
with
acute
bronchitis
will
be
coughing
after
7
days
following
initiation
of
treatment
This
effect
appears
to
be
independent
of
cigarette
smoking
or
the
concomitant
use
of
antibiotics
