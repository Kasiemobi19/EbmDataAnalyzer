Abstract
Text
To
review
the
epidemiology
pathophysiology
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
urinary
tract
infections
in
men
especially
insofar
as
they
differ
from
those
in
women
Studies
published
between
1954
and
1988
were
identified
using
MEDLINE
(1981-1988)
and
Index
Medicus
(1981-1988)
and
through
extensive
manual
searching
of
textbooks
symposia
monographs
and
bibliographies
of
identified
articles
More
than
200
studies
were
reviewed
those
studies
most
pertinent
to
the
topics
reviewed
were
cited
Unpublished
data
from
the
author's
studies
were
also
cited
Study
quality
and
descriptive
information
about
prevalence
evaluations
interventions
and
outcomes
were
assessed
Quantitative
synthesis
was
not
done
Most
men
with
urinary
tract
infection
have
a
functional
or
anatomic
abnormality
of
the
genitourinary
tract
Prostatic
hypertrophy
and
genitourinary
instrumentation
are
the
major
predispositions
to
infection
in
men
Signs
and
symptoms
of
bacteriuria
in
men
are
similar
to
those
in
women
Diagnosis
rests
on
a
properly
collected
specimen
yielding
10(3)
or
more
colony-forming
units/mL
of
a
single
or
predominant
species
Eschericia
coli
is
the
most
frequent
uropathogen
but
other
gram-negative
and
gram-positive
species
cause
up
to
one
half
of
cases
Treatment
of
men
with
single-dose
therapy
is
inadequate
men
with
recurrent
infections
require
at
least
6
weeks
of
appropriate
treatment
Asymptomatic
bacteriuria
is
common
in
elderly
men
but
does
not
usually
necessitate
treatment
Although
genitourinary
abnormalities
are
frequent
in
bacteriuric
male
patients
a
diagnostic
evaluation
is
probably
indicated
only
in
young
boys
and
in
men
with
recurrent
or
complicated
infections
Several
important
aspects
of
the
epidemiology
pathophysiology
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
urinary
tract
infections
differ
in
male
populations
from
those
in
the
much
better
studied
female
populations
Knowledge
of
recently
available
data
will
help
clinicians
develop
a
rational
approach
to
caring
for
bacteriuric
men
