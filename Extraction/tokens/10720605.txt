Abstract
Text
This
article
is
a
critical
review
of
the
available
evidence
on
the
prognostic
value
of
ambulatory
blood
pressure
(ABP)
Several
event-based
cohort
studies
have
shown
that
ABP
improves
cardiovascular
risk
stratification
over
and
beyond
traditional
risk
factors
including
office
BP
Most
of
these
studies
have
been
conducted
in
subjects
with
essential
hypertension
who
were
untreated
at
the
time
of
execution
of
ABP
monitoring
other
studies
have
been
conducted
in
subjects
who
were
poorly
controlled
with
treatment
or
in
the
general
population
In
these
studies
ABP
was
examined
as
a
continuous
variable
or
with
operational
risk
categories
Cardiovascular
risk
showed
a
direct
and
independent
association
with
the
observed
ABP
(systolic
diastolic
and
pulse)
and
an
inverse
association
with
the
degree
of
BP
reduction
from
day
to
night
Cardiovascular
risk
was
also
directly
associated
with
the
difference
between
the
observed
value
of
ABP
and
that
predicted
from
the
office
BP
White-coat
hypertension
versus
ambulatory
hypertension
and
dippers
versus
nondippers
are
2
classifications
based
on
arbitrary
operational
risk
categories
A
blunted
or
absent
BP
reduction
from
day
to
night
defined
with
ABP
as
a
continuous
variable
or
with
operational
thresholds
was
also
associated
with
a
worse
outcome
regardless
of
the
average
value
of
ABP
during
the
24
hours
Overall
these
studies
indicate
that
ABP
monitoring
is
particularly
valuable
to
refine
cardiovascular
risk
stratification
in
untreated
subjects
with
office
hypertension
and
in
those
with
resistant
hypertension
Intervention
studies
targeted
at
ABP
are
now
needed
