and
irritable
bowel
syndrome
a
review

efficacy

action
Abstract
Text
Irritable
bowel
syndrome
(IBS)
is
a
functional
gastrointestinal
disorder
characterized
by
abdominal
pain
distension
and
an
altered
bowel
habit
for
which
no
cause
can
be
found
Despite
its
prevalence
there
remains
a
significant
lack
of
efficacious
medical
treatments
for
IBS
to
date
In
this
paper
we
reviewed
a
total
of
14
published
studies
(N=644)
on
the
efficacy
of
hypnosis
in
treating
IBS
(8
with
no
control
group
and
6
with
a
control
group)
We
concluded
that
hypnosis
consistently
produces
significant
results
and
improves
the
cardinal
symptoms
of
IBS
in
the
majority
of
patients
as
well
as
positively
affecting
non-colonic
symptoms
When
evaluated
according
to
the
efficacy
guidelines
of
the
Clinical
Psychology
Division
of
American
Psychological
Association
the
use
of
hypnosis
with
IBS
qualifies
for
the
highest
level
of
acceptance
as
being
both
efficacious
and
specific
In
reviewing
the
research
on
the
mechanism
of
action
as
to
how
hypnosis
works
to
reduce
symptoms
of
IBS
some
evidence
was
found
to
support
both
physiological
and
psychological
mechanisms
of
action
