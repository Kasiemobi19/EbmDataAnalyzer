Abstract
Text
The
optimal
management
of
fibromyalgia
syndrome
(FMS)
is
unclear
and
comprehensive
evidence-based
guidelines
have
not
been
reported
To
provide
up-to-date
evidence-based
guidelines
for
the
optimal
treatment
of
FMS
DATA
SOURCES
SELECTION
AND
EXTRACTION
A
search
of
all
human
trials
(randomized
controlled
trials
and
meta-analyses
of
randomized
controlled
trials)
of
FMS
was
made
using
Cochrane
Collaboration
Reviews
(1993-2004)
MEDLINE
(1966-2004)
CINAHL
(1982-2004)
EMBASE
(1988-2004)

The
literature
review
was
performed
by
an
interdisciplinary
panel
composed
of
13
experts
in
various
pain
management
disciplines
selected
by
the
American
Pain
Society
(APS)
and
supplemented
by
selected
literature
reviews
by
APS
staff
members
and
the
Utah
Drug
Information
Service
A
total
of
505
articles
were
reviewed
There
are
major
limitations
to
the
FMS
literature
with
many
treatment
trials
compromised
by
short
duration
and
lack
of
masking
There
are
no
medical
therapies
that
have
been
specifically
approved
by
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
for
management
of
FMS
Nonetheless
current
evidence
suggests
efficacy
of
low-dose
tricyclic
antidepressants
cardiovascular
exercise
cognitive
behavioral
therapy
and
patient
education
A
number
of
other
commonly
used
FMS
therapies
such
as
trigger
point
injections
have
not
been
adequately
evaluated
Despite
the
chronicity
and
complexity
of
FMS
there
are
pharmacological
and
nonpharmacological
interventions
available
that
have
clinical
benefit
Based
on
current
evidence
a
stepwise
program
emphasizing
education
certain
medications
exercise
cognitive
therapy
or
all
4
should
be
recommended
