Comparison
of
the
effectiveness
of
inhaler
devices
in
asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
airways
disease
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
Abstract
Text
Asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(COPD)
are
common
diseases
of
the
airways
and
lungs
that
have
a
major
impact
on
the
health
of
the
population
The
mainstay
of
treatment
is
by
inhalation
of
medication
to
the
site
of
the
disease
process
This
can
be
achieved
by
a
number
of
different
device
types
which
have
wide
variations
in
costs
to
the
health
service
A
number
of
different
inhalation
devices
are
available
The
pressurised
metered-dose
inhaler
(pMDI)
is
the
most
commonly
used
and
cheapest
device
which
may
also
be
used
in
conjunction
with
a
spacer
device
Newer
chlorofluorocarbons
(CFC)-free
inhaler
devices
using
hydrofluoroalkanes
(HFAs)
have
also
been
developed
The
drug
is
dissolved
or
suspended
in
the
propellant
under
pressure
When
activated
a
valve
system
releases
a
metered
volume
of
drug
and
propellant
Other
devices
include
breath-actuated
pMDIs
(BA-pMDI)
such
as
Autohaler
and
Easi-Breathe
They
incorporate
a
mechanism
activated
during
inhalation
that
triggers
the
metered-dose
inhaler
Dry
powder
inhalers
(DPI)
such
as
Turbohaler
Diskhaler
Accuhaler
and
Rotahaler
are
activated
by
inspiration
by
the
patient
The
powdered
drug
is
dispersed
into
particles
by
the
inspiration
With
nebulisers
oxygen
compressed
air
or
ultrasonic
power
is
used
to
break
up
solutions
or
suspensions
of
medication
into
droplets
for
inhalation
The
aerosol
is
administered
by
mask
or
by
a
mouthpiece
There
has
been
no
previous
systematic
review
of
the
evidence
of
clinical
effectiveness
and
cost-effectiveness
of
these
different
inhaler
devices
To
review
systematically
the
clinical
effectiveness
and
cost-effectiveness
of
inhaler
devices
in
asthma
and
COPD
The
different
aspects
of
inhaler
devices
were
separated
into
the
most
clinically
relevant
comparisons
Methods
involved
systematic
searching
of
electronic
databases
and
bibliographies
for
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
and
systematic
reviews
Pharmaceutical
companies
and
experts
in
the
field
were
contacted
for
further
information
Trials
that
met
the
inclusion
criteria
were
appraised
and
data
extraction
was
under-taken
by
one
reviewer
and
checked
by
a
second
reviewer
with
any
discrepancies
being
resolved
through
agreement
RESULTS--IN
VITRO
CHARACTERISTICS
VERSUS
IN
VIVO
TESTING
AND
CLINICAL
RESPONSE
There
is
evidence
that
when
comparative
testing
is
performed
on
inhaler
devices
using
the
same
methods
there
is
some
correlation
between
particle
size
measurements
and
clinical
response
However
the
measurements
are
dependent
upon
the
methods
used
and
a
single
measure
of
a
device
in
isolation
is
of
limited
value
Also
there
is
little
data
on
comparing
devices
of
different
types
There
is
currently
insufficient
data
to
verify
the
ability
of
in
vitro
assessments
to
predict
inhaler
performance
in
vivo
RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS
OF
METERED-DOSE
INHALERS
FOR
THE
DELIVERY
OF
CORTICOSTEROIDS
IN
ASTHMA
The
review
of
three
trials
in
children
and
21
trials
in
adults
demonstrated
no
evidence
to
suggest
clinical
benefits
of
any
other
inhaler
device
over
a
pMDI
in
corticosteroid
delivery
RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS
OF
METERED-DOSE
INHALERS
FOR
THE
DELIVERY
OF
BETA-AGONISTS
IN
STABLE
ASTHMA
In
children
11
studies
were
reviewed
of
which
seven
compared
the
Turbohaler
with
the
pMDI
One
study
found
a
significant
treatment
difference
in
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
although
there
were
differences
in
the
patients'
baseline
characteristics
In
adults
a
review
of
70
studies
found
no
demonstrable
difference
in
the
clinical
bronchodilator
effect
of
short-acting
b2-agonists
delivered
by
the
standard
pMDI
compared
with
that
produced
by
any
other
DPI
HFA-pMDI
or
the
Autohaler
device
The
finding
that
HFA-pMDIs
may
reduce
treatment
failure
and
oral
steroid
requirement
in
beta-agonist
delivery
needs
further
confirmatory
research
in
adequately
randomised
clinical
trials
RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS
OF
NEBULISERS
VERSUS
METERED-DOSE
INHALERS
FOR
THE
DELIVERY
OF
BRONCHODILATORS
IN
STABLE
ASTHMA
In
children
three
included
trials
compared
different
devices
with
a
nebuliser
and
demonstrated
no
evidence
of
clinical
superiority
of
nebulisers
over
inhaler
devices
in
bronchodilator
delivery
A
total
of
23
studies
in
adults
found
no
equivalence
for
the
main
pulmonary
outcomes
and
no
evidence
of
difference
in
other
outcomes
RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS
OF
METERED-DOSE
INHALERS
FOR
THE
DELIVERY
OF
BETA-AGONISTS
IN
COPD
Only
two
studies
were
included
in
this
review
No
evidence
of
clinical
difference
was
found
in
beta-agonist
delivery
RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS
OF

VERSUS

OF

IN
COPD
Evidence
from
14
trials
demonstrated
equivalence
for
the
main
outcomes
of
pulmonary
function
For
other
outcomes
there
was
no
evidence
of
treatment
difference
in
bronchodilator
delivery
RESULTS--PATIENTS'
ABILITY
TO
USE
METERED-DOSE
INHALERS
Differences
among
studies
and
the
heterogeneity
of
the
results
make
it
difficult
to
draw
conclusions
about
inhaler
technique
differences
between
device
types
The
review
of
technique
after
teaching
the
correct
technique
suggests
that
there
is
no
difference
in
patients'
ability
to
use
DPI
or
pMDIs
RESULTS--ECONOMIC
ANALYSIS
The
total
number
of
NHS
prescriptions
for
inhaler
therapy
for
asthma
in
1998
was
over
31
million
with
a
net
ingredient
cost
in
excess
of
392
million
GB
pounds
This
economic
assessment
uses
decision
analysis
to
estimate
the
relative
cost-effectiveness
of
inhaler
devices
for
the
delivery
of
bronchodilator
and
corticosteroid
inhaled
therapy
Overall
there
were
no
differences
in
patient
outcomes
among
the
devices
On
the
assumption
that
the
devices
were
clinically
equivalent
pMDIs
were
the
most
cost-effective
devices
for
asthma
treatment
This
systematic
review
examined
the
evidence
from
clinical
trials
evaluating
the
clinical
effectiveness
of
different
inhaler
devices
in
the
delivery
of
inhaled
corticosteroids
and
beta2-bronchodilators
for
patients
with
asthma
and
COPD
The
evidence
from
the
published
clinical
literature
demonstrates
no
difference
in
clinical
effectiveness
between
nebulisers
and
alternative
inhaler
devices
compared
to
standard
pMDI
with
or
without
a
spacer
device
The
cost-effectiveness
evidence
therefore
favours
pMDIs
(or
the
cheapest
inhaler
device)
as
first-line
treatment
in
all
patients
with
stable
asthma
unless
other
specific
reasons
are
identified
Patients
can
use
pMDIs
as
effectively
as
other
inhaler
devices
as
long
as
the
correct
inhalation
technique
is
taught
CONCLUSIONS--RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
RESEARCH
Further
clinical
trials
are
required
to
demonstrate
any
differences
in
the
clinical
effectiveness
and
cost-effectiveness
of
inhaler
devices
and
nebulisers
compared
with
pMDIs
These
should
be
of
sufficient
statistical
power
and
methodological
rigour
to
demonstrate
any
clinical
benefit
Trials
should
be
undertaken
in
community
settings
to
ensure
the
generalisability
of
results
Outcome
measures
should
be
more
patient-centred
and
report
adverse
effects
more
completely
Reporting
of
data
from
trials
should
be
improved
