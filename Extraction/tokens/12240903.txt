Title
Incidence
at
birth
and
natural
history
of
cryptorchidism
a
study

10730
consecutive
male
infants
Abstract
Text
Of
the
10730
neonates
born
in
the
period
1978-1997
and
examined
for
cryptorchidism
(C)
at
birth
1387
were
pre-term
(gestational
age
<37
wk)
and
9343
were
full-term
At
birth
a
total
of
737
neonates
(69%)
were
cryptorchid
487
had
bilateral
C
and
250
unilateral
C
The
C
rate
of
pre-terms
was
10
times
higher
than
that
of
the
full-terms
(301
and
34%
respectively)
Comparing
the
two
studied
decades
a
significant
decrease
of
C
rate
was
found
in
the
second
decade
in
full-term
neonates
The
rates
of
C
at
birth
were
significantly
elevated
for
low
birth
weight
babies
born
from
mothers
with
an
age
<20
or
>35
yr
newborns
from
mothers
with
A
Rh
positive
and
B
Rh
positive
blood
group
Of
the
737
cryptorchid
newborns
at
birth
613
(83%)
were
re-examined
after
12
months
from
the
expected
date
of
delivery
and
those
born
in
the
period
1988-1997
were
also
re-evaluated
at
6
months
of
life
Late
spontaneous
descent
occurred
in
464
cases
(757%)
while
149
(243%)
were
still
cryptorchid
The
incidence
of
C
at
12
months
from
the
expected
date
of
delivery
after
survival
curve
calculation
in
term
and
pre-term
infants
was
153
and
731%
respectively
in
the
period
1978-1987
and
122
and
313%
respectively
in
the
2nd
decade
(1988-1997)
In
the
groups
also
examined
at
6
months
of
life
spontaneous
descent
occurred
almost
completely
within
the
first
6
months
of
life
in
term
infants
but
not
in
pre-terms
No
evidence
of
seasonal
cyclicity
was
found
Medical
and/or
surgical
treatment
was
generally
started
within
2-4
yr
of
age
earlier
in
the
second
decade
of
the
study
In
conclusion
the
main
risk
factor
for
C
at
birth
and
at
12
months
of
life
seems
to
be
pre-term
birth
and
low
birth
weight
If
this
is
associated
itself
to
a
higher
risk
of
infertility
too
it
remains
to
be
defined
