The
rational
clinical
examination
Does
this
patient
have
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
Abstract
Text
History
taking
and
physical
examination
maneuvers
including
Tinel
and
Phalen
signs
are
widely
used
for
the
diagnosis
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
(CTS)
To
systematically
review
the
precision
and
accuracy
of
history
taking
and
physical
examination
in
diagnosing
CTS
in
adults
English-language
literature
was
searched
using
MEDLINE
(January
1966-February
2000)
as
well
as
bibliographies
of
relevant
articles
Studies
of
patients
presenting
to
clinicians
with
symptoms
suggestive
of
CTS
in
which
findings
from
clearly
described
physical
examination
maneuvers
were
independently
compared
with
electrodiagnostic
testing
Twelve
of
42
initially
identified
articles
met
these
criteria
and
were
included
in
the
review
Two
authors
independently
reviewed
and
abstracted
data
from
all
of
the
articles
and
reached
consensus
about
any
discrepancies
In
patients
presenting
with
hand
dysesthesias
the
findings
that
best
distinguish
between
patients
with
electrodiagnostic
evidence
of
CTS
and
patients
without
it
are
hypalgesia
in
the
median
nerve
territory
(likelihood

classic

and
weak

strength
(LR

Findings
that
argue
against
the
diagnosis
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
are
unlikely

and

(LR

Several
traditional
findings
of
CTS
have
little
or
no
diagnostic
value
including
nocturnal
paresthesias
Phalen
and
Tinel
signs
thenar
atrophy
and
2-point
vibratory
and
monofilament
sensory
testing
Other
less
commonly
used
maneuvers
including
the
square
wrist
sign
flick
sign
and
closed
fist
sign
require
validation
by
other
studies
before
they
can
be
recommended
Hand
symptom
diagrams
hypalgesia
and
thumb
abduction
strength
testing
are
helpful
in
establishing
the
[corrected]
electrodiagnosis
of
CTS
The
utility
of
these
results
is
limited
however
by
problems
inherent
in
using
nerve
conduction
studies
as
a
criterion
standard
