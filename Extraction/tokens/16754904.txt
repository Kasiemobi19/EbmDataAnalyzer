Re-examining
the
efficacy
of
beta-blockers
for
the
treatment
of
hypertension
a
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
In
a
recently
published
meta-analysis
investigators
asserted
that
beta-blockers
should
not
be
used
to
treat
hypertension
Because
the
pathophysiology
of
hypertension
differs
in
older
and
younger
patients
we
designed
this
meta-analysis
to
clarify
the
efficacy
of
beta-blockers
in
different
age
groups
The
primary
outcome
was
a
composite
of
stroke
myocardial
infarction
and
death
We
identified
randomized
controlled
trials
that
evaluated
the
efficacy
of
beta-blockers
as
first-line
therapy
for
hypertension
in
preventing
major
cardiovascular
outcomes
Both
authors
independently
evaluated
the
eligibility
of
all
trials
Trials
enrolling
older
(mean
age
at
baseline
>
or
=
60
years)
patients
were
separated
from
those
enrolling
younger
(mean
age
<
60
years)
patients
Data
were
pooled
using
a
random
effects
model
Our
analysis
incorporated
data
from
145
811
participants
in
21
hypertension
trials
In
placebo-controlled
trials
beta-blockers
reduced
major
cardiovascular
outcomes
in
younger
patients
(risk
ratio
[RR]
086
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
074-099
based
on
794
events
in
19
414
patients)
but
not
in
older
patients
(RR
089
95%
CI
075-105
based
on
1115
events
in
8019
patients)
In
active
comparator
trials
beta-blockers
demonstrated
similar
efficacy
to
other
antihypertensive
agents
in
younger
patients
(1515
events
in
30
412
patients
RR
097
95%
CI
088-107)
but
not
in
older
patients
(7405
events
in
79
775
patients
RR
106
95%
CI
101-110)
with
the
excess
risk
being
particularly
marked
for
strokes
(RR
118
95%
CI
107-130)
beta-blockers
should
not
be
considered
first-line
therapy
for
older
hypertensive
patients
without
another
indication
for
these
agents
however
in
younger
patients
beta-blockers
are
associated
with
a
significant
reduction
in
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
