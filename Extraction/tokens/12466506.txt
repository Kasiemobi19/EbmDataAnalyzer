A
comparison
of
rate
control
and
rhythm
control
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
Abstract
Text
There
are
two
approaches
to
the
treatment
of
atrial
fibrillation
one
is
cardioversion
and
treatment
with
antiarrhythmic
drugs
to
maintain
sinus
rhythm
and
the
other
is
the
use
of
rate-controlling
drugs
allowing
atrial
fibrillation
to
persist
In
both
approaches
the
use
of
anticoagulant
drugs
is
recommended
We
conducted
a
randomized
multicenter
comparison
of
these
two
treatment
strategies
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
and
a
high
risk
of
stroke
or
death
The
primary
end
point
was
overall
mortality
A
total
of
4060
patients
(mean
[+/-SD]
age
697+/-90
years)
were
enrolled
in
the
study
708
percent
had
a
history
of
hypertension
and
382
percent
had
coronary
artery
disease
Of
the
3311
patients
with
echocardiograms
the
left
atrium
was
enlarged
in
647
percent
and
left
ventricular
function
was
depressed
in
260
percent
There
were
356
deaths
among
the
patients
assigned
to
rhythm-control
therapy
and
310
deaths
among
those
assigned
to
rate-control
therapy
(mortality
at
five
years
238
percent
and
213
percent
respectively
hazard
ratio
115
[95
percent
confidence
interval
099
to
134]
P=008)
More
patients
in
the
rhythm-control
group
than
in
the
rate-control
group
were
hospitalized
and
there
were
more
adverse
drug
effects
in
the
rhythm-control
group
as
well
In
both
groups
the
majority
of
strokes
occurred
after
warfarin
had
been
stopped
or
when
the
international
normalized
ratio
was
subtherapeutic
Management
of
atrial
fibrillation
with
the
rhythm-control
strategy
offers
no
survival
advantage
over
the
rate-control
strategy
and
there
are
potential
advantages
such
as
a
lower
risk
of
adverse
drug
effects
with
the
rate-control
strategy
Anticoagulation
should
be
continued
in
this
group
of
high-risk
patients
