Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
metabolic
effects
of
pioglitazone
metformin
and
glimepiride
in
the
treatment
of
Japanese
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
Type
2
diabetes
A
total
of
114
patients
with
Type
2
diabetes
who
had
never
used
oral
hypoglycaemic
drugs
were
studied
for
12
months
Patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
pioglitazone
(30-45
mg/day
n
=
38)
metformin
(750
mg/day
n
=
39)
or
glimepiride
(10-20
mg/day
n
=
37)
The
effect
of
treatment
on
fasting
plasma
glucose
(FPG)
glycated
haemoglobin
(HbA(1c))
15-anhydroglucitol
(15AG)
total
cholesterol
high-density
lipoprotein
(HDL)-cholesterol
triglycerides
free
fatty
acids
(FFA)
and
fasting
plasma
insulin
levels
was
monitored
monthly
Body
weight
and
safety
data
were
also
collected
Eight
patients
withdrew
from
the
study
(three
in
the
pioglitazone
group
two
in
the
metformin
group
and
three
in
the
glimepiride
group)
The
rate
of
reduction
of
HbA(1c)
was
fastest
in
patients
receiving
glimepiride
and
slowest
in
patients
receiving
pioglitazone
Although
there
were
no
significant
differences
among
the
three
groups
in
HbA(1c)
levels
at
the
end
of
the
study
patients
taking
pioglitazone
had
relatively
lower
FPG
and
15AG
levels
than
patients
taking
the
other
two
drugs
These
results
suggest
that
pioglitazone
acts
predominantly
on
nocturnal
metabolism
rather
than
at
mealtimes
FFA
were
reduced
significantly
in
those
taking
pioglitazone
(5422
microEq/l
vs
2373
microEq/l
P
<
001)
before
a
decrease
in
HbA(1c)
was
apparent
The
change
in
FFA
levels
correlated
with
the
change
in
HbA(1c)
(r
=
0409
P
<
001)
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
other
lipid
parameters
among
the
groups
Pioglitazone
metformin
and
glimepiride
are
equally
effective
in
reducing
blood
glucose
in
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
Type
2
diabetes
However
their
specific
characteristics
such
as
the
rapid
action
on
blood
glucose
levels
of
glimepiride
and
the
favourable
action
on
FPG
and
FFA
of
pioglitazone
should
be
considered
when
choosing
an
appropriate
agent
