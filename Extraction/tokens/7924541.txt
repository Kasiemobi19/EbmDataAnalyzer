Nonpharmacologic
therapy
improves
functional

in
congestive

Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
effects
of
a
multimodal
nonpharmacologic
intervention
to
digoxin
and
to
placebo
in
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
receiving
background
therapy
with
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
Randomized
parallel
assignment
to
three
treatment
groups
of
20
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
(New
York
Heart
Association
Class
II
and
III)
Nonpharmacologic
treatment
program
included
the
following
(1)
graduated
exercise
training
three
to
five
times
per
week
(2)
structured
cognitive
therapy
and
stress
management
and
(3)
dietary
intervention
aimed
at
salt
reduction
and
weight
reduction
in
the
overweight
Digoxin
was
titrated
to
achieve
a
blood
level
between
08
and
20
ng/ml
Placebo
and
digoxin
were
administered
in
a
randomized
double-blind
fashion
Echocardiographic
ejection
fraction
improved
(p
<
005)
in
the
digitalis
group
(change
=
+44
+/-
65)
compared
with
both
placebo
(change
=
-32
+/-
39)
and
nonpharmacologic
therapy
(change
=
-32
+/-
39)
The
nonpharmacologic
treatment
program
was
well
tolerated
by
all
patients
and
resulted
in
significant
improvement
(p
<
005)
in
exercise
tolerance
(digoxin
=
+51
+/-
50
s
placebo
=
+91
+/-

nonpharmacologic
therapy
=
+182
+/-
139)
as
well
as

Hamilton

and
depression
(digoxin
=

+/-

placebo
=
+50
+/-
50
nonpharmacologic
therapy
=
-66
+/-

In
addition
weight
loss
was
significantly
greater
with
nonpharmacologic
therapy
(digoxin
=
+032
+/-
176
kg
placebo
=
-135
+/-
144
kg
nonpharmacologic
therapy
=
-437
+/-
450
kg)
compared
with
both
digoxin
and
placebo
Nonpharmacologic
therapy
improved
functional
capacity
body
weight
and
mood
state
in
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
In
contrast
digoxin
improved
ejection
fraction
without
corresponding
changes
in
exercise
tolerance
or
quality
of
life
