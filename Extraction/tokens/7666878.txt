Abstract
Text
Patients
with
back
pain
receive
quite
different
care
from
different
types
of
health
care
practitioners
We
performed
a
prospective
observational
study
to
determine
whether
the
outcomes
of
and
charges
for
care
differ
among
primary
care
practitioners
chiropractors
and
orthopedic
surgeons
Two
hundred
eight
practitioners
in
North
Carolina
were
randomly
selected
from
six
strata
urban
primary
care
physicians
(n
=
39)
rural
primary
care
physicians
(n
=
48)
urban
chiropractors
(n
=
32)
rural
chiropractors
(n
=
32)
orthopedic
surgeons
(n
=
29)
and
primary
care
providers
at
a
group-model
health
maintenance
organization
(HMO)
(n
=
28)
The
practitioners
enrolled
consecutive
patients
with
acute
low
back
pain
The
patients
were
contacted
by
telephone
periodically
for
up
to
24
weeks
to
assess
functional
status
work
status
use
of
health
care
services
and
satisfaction
with
the
care
received
The
status
at
six
months
was
ascertained
for
1555
of
the
1633
patients
enrolled
in
the
study
(95
percent)
The
times
to
functional
recovery
return
to
work
and
complete
recovery
from
low
back
pain
were
similar
among
patients
seen
by
all
six
groups
of
practitioners
but
there
were
marked
differences
in
the
use
of
health
care
services
The
mean
total
estimated
outpatient
charges
were
highest
for
the
patients
seen
by
orthopedic
surgeons
and
chiropractors
and
were
lowest
for
the
patients
seen
by
HMO
and
primary
care
providers
Satisfaction
was
greatest
among
the
patients
who
went
to
the
chiropractors
Among
patients
with
acute
low
back
pain
the
outcomes
are
similar
whether
they
receive
care
from
primary
care
practitioners
chiropractors
or
orthopedic
surgeons
Primary
care
practitioners
provide
the
least
expensive
care
for
acute
low
back
pain
