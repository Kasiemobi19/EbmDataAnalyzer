during

Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
perineal
massage
during
pregnancy
for
the
prevention
of
perineal
trauma
at
birth
Study
Design
Pregnant
women
with
(n
=
493)
and
without
(n
=
1034)
a
previous
vaginal
birth
from
5
hospitals
in
the
province
of
Qu√©bec
Canada
participated
in
this
single-blind
randomized
controlled
trial
All
participants
received
oral
and
written
information
on
the
prevention
of
perineal
trauma
Women
in
the
experimental
groups
were
requested
to
perform
a
10-minute
perineal
massage
daily
from
the
34th
or
35th
week
of
pregnancy
until
delivery
Among
participants
without
a
previous
vaginal
birth
243%
(100/411)
from
the
perineal
massage
group
and
151%
(63/417)
from
the
control
group
were
delivered
vaginally
with
an
intact
perineum
for
a
92%
absolute
difference
(95%
confidence
interval
38%-146%)
The
incidence
of
delivery
with
an
intact
perineum
increased
with
compliance
with
regular
practice
of
perineal
massage
(chi2
for
trend

P
=

Among
women
with
a
previous
vaginal
birth
349%
(82/235)
and
324%
(78/241)
in
the
massage
and
control
groups
respectively
were
delivered
with
an
intact
perineum
for
an
absolute
difference
of
25%
(95%
confidence
interval
-60%
to
110%)
There
were
no
differences
between
the
groups
in
the
frequency
of
sutured
vulvar
and
vaginal
tears
women's
sense
of
control
and
satisfaction
with
the
delivery
experience
Perineal
massage
is
an
effective
approach
to
increasing
the
chance
of
delivery
with
an
intact
perineum
for
women
with
a
first
vaginal
delivery
but
not
for
women
with
a
previous
vaginal
birth
