Abstract
Text
To
assess
the
long
term
effectiveness
of
the
"green
prescription"
programme
a
clinician
based
initiative
in
general
practice
that
provides
counselling
on
physical
activity
Cluster
randomised
controlled
trial
Practices
were
randomised
before
systematic
screening
and
recruitment
of
patients
42
rural
and
urban
general
practices
in
one
region
of
New
Zealand
All
sedentary
40-79
year
old
patients
visiting
their
general
practitioner
during
the
study's
recruitment
period
General
practitioners
were
prompted
by
the
patient
to
give
oral
and
written
advice
on
physical
activity
during
usual
consultations
Exercise
specialists
continued
support
by
telephone
and
post
Control
patients
received
usual
care
Change
in
physical
activity
quality
of
life
(as
measured
by
the
"short
form
36"
(SF-36)
questionnaire)
cardiovascular
risk
(Framingham
and
D'Agostino
equations)
and
blood
pressure
over
a
12
month
period
74%
(117/159)
of
general
practitioners
and
66%
(878/1322)
of
screened
eligible
patients
participated
in
the
study
The
follow
up
rate
was
85%
(750/878)
Mean
total
energy
expenditure
increased
by
94
kcal/kg/week
(P=0001)
and
leisure
exercise
by
27
kcal/kg/week
(P=002)
or
34
minutes/week
more
in
the
intervention
group
than
in
the
control
group
(P=004)
The
proportion
of
the
intervention
group
undertaking
25
hours/week
of
leisure
exercise
increased
by
972%
(P=0003)
more
than
in
the
control
group
(number
needed
to
treat=103)
SF-36
measures
of
self
rated
"general
health"
"role
physical"
"vitality"
and
"bodily
pain"
improved
significantly
more
in
the
intervention
group
(P<005)
A
trend
towards
decreasing
blood
pressure
became
apparent
but
no
significant
difference
in
four
year
risk
of
coronary
heart
disease
Counselling
patients
in
general
practice
on
exercise
is
effective
in
increasing
physical
activity
and
improving
quality
of
life
over
12
months
