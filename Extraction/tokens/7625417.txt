To
assess
risk
factors
for
hepatitis
A
infection
among
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
during
a
community-wide
outbreak
of
hepatitis
A
in
New
York
City
Twenty-five
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
20
to
49
years
of
age
with
hepatitis
A
identified
from
health
department
surveillance
data
(cases)
were
compared
with
42
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
of
similar
age
distribution
who
were
seronegative
for
hepatitis
A
virus
and
identified
from
private
physician
offices
(controls)
Odds
ratio
(OR)
were
determined
for
acute
hepatitis
A
infection
according
to
demographics
numbers
of
sexual
partners
frequency
of
specific
sexual
behaviors
and
self-reported
human
immunodeficiency
virus
status
Cases
had
more
anonymous
sex
partners
(0
to
1
partner
versus
>
1
partner)
than
controls
during
the
6
weeks
before
illness
onset
(OR
=
44
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
14
to
144)
Cases
were
more
likely
than
controls
to
have
engaged
in
group
sex
(OR
=
38
95%
CI
11
to
126)
Among
specific
sexual
behaviors
examined
oral-anal
intercourse
(oral
role)
and
digital-rectal
intercourse
(digital
role)
with
anonymous
sex
partners
were
more
commonly
reported
by
cases
than
controls
(OR
=
97
95%
CI
12
to
787
and
OR
=
26
95%
CI
10
to
74
respectively)
Multivariate
analysis
showed
that
>
1
anonymous
sex
partner
group
sex
oral-anal
intercourse
and
digital-rectal
intercourse
were
associated
with
illness
in
models
controlling
for
duration
of
sexual
activity
Because
these
variables
were
highly
correlated
independent
risk
could
not
be
evaluated
in
a
single
model
Hepatitis
A
infection
among
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
is
associated
with
oral-anal
and
digital-rectal
intercourse
as
well
as
with
increasing
numbers
of
anonymous
sex
partners
and
group
sex
These
findings
reinforce
the
importance
of
developing
educational
activities
for
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
that
focus
on
risk
reduction
for
hepatitis
A
as
well
as
other
sexually
transmitted
disease
spread
via
the
fecal-oral
route
