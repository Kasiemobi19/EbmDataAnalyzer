Title
Dietary
advice
for
reducing
cardiovascular
risk
Abstract
Text
Changes
in
population
diet
are
likely
to
reduce
cardiovascular
disease
and
cancer
but
the
effect
of
dietary
advice
is
uncertain
To
assess
the
effects
of
providing
dietary
advice
to
achieve
sustained
dietary
changes
or
improved
cardiovascular
risk
profile
among
healthy
adults
We
searched

Cochrane
Controlled
Trials

on
The

We
contacted
researchers
in
the
field
Randomised
studies
with
no
more
than
20%
loss
to
follow-up
lasting
at
least
three
months
involving
healthy
adults
comparing
dietary
advice
with
no
advice
or
less
intensive
advice
Trials
involving
children
trials
to
reduce
weight
or
those
involving
supplementation
were
excluded
Two
reviewers
independently
assessed
trial
quality
and
extracted
data
Study
authors
were
contacted
for
additional
information
Twenty-three
trials
with
29
intervention
arms
(comparisons)
comparing
dietary
advice
with
no
advice
were
included
in
the
review
Dietary
advice
reduced
total
serum
cholesterol
by
013
mmol/l
(95%
CI
003
to
023)
and
LDL
cholesterol
by
013
mmol/l
(95%
CI
001
to
025)
after
3-12
months
Mean
HDL
cholesterol
levels
were
unchanged
Dietary
advice
reduced
blood
pressure
by
210
mmHg
systolic
(95%
CI
137
to
283)
and
163
mmHg
diastolic
(95%
CI
056
to
271)
and
24-hour
urinary
sodium
excretion
by
442
mmol
(95%
CI
336
to
547)
after
3-36
months
Plasma
triglycerides
ss-carotene
and
red
cell
folate
were
each
measured
in
one
small
study
which
suggested
no
significant
effect
Self-reported
dietary
intake
may
be
subject
to
reporting
bias
and
there
was
significant
heterogeneity
in
all
the
following
analyses
Compared
to
no
advice
dietary
advice
increased
fruit
and
vegetable
intake
by
124
servings/day
(95%
CI
043
to
205)
Dietary
fibre
intake
increased
with
advice
by
722
g/day
(95%
CI
284
to
1160)
while
total
dietary
fat
as
a
percentage
of
total
energy
intake
fell
by
618
%
(95%
CI
400
to
836)
with
dietary
advice
and
saturated
fat
intake
fell
by
328
%
(95%
CI
192
to
464)
Dietary
advice
appears
to
be
effective
in
bringing
about
modest
beneficial
changes
in
diet
and
cardiovascular
risk
factors
over
approximately
9
months
but
longer
term
effects
are
not
known
