Corticotropin
tests
for
hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal
insufficiency
a
metaanalysis
Abstract
Text
The
diagnostic
value
of
tests
for
detecting
hypothalamic-pituitary
adrenal
insufficiency
(HPAI)
is
controversial
Our
objective
was
to
compare
standard-dose
and
low-dose
corticotropin
tests
for
diagnosing
HPAI
We
searched
the
PubMed
database
from
1966-2006
for
studies
reporting
diagnostic
value
of
standard-dose
or
low-dose
corticotropin
tests
with
patient-level
data
obtained
from
original
investigators
Eligible
studies
had
more
than
10
patients
All
subjects
were
evaluated
because
of
suspicion
for
chronic
HPAI
and
patient-level
data
were
available
We
excluded
studies
with
no
accepted
reference
standard
for
HPAI
(insulin
hypoglycemia
or
metyrapone
test)
if
test
subjects
were
in
the
intensive
care
unit
or
if
only
normal
healthy
subjects
were
used
as
controls
We
constructed
receiver
operator
characteristic
(ROC)
curves
using
patient-level
data
from
each
study
and
then
merged
results
to
create
summary
ROC
curves
adjusting
for
study
size
and
cortisol
assay
method
Diagnostic
value
of
tests
was
measured
by
calculating
area
under
the
ROC
curve
(AUC)
and
likelihood
ratios
Patient-level
data
from
13
of
23
studies
(57%
679
subjects)
were
included
in
the
metaanalysis
The
AUC
were
as
follows
low-dose
corticotropin
test
092
(95%
confidence
interval
089-094)
and
standard-dose
corticotropin
test
079
(95%
confidence
interval
074-084)
Among
patients
with
paired
data
(seven
studies
254
subjects)
diagnostic
value
of
low-dose
corticotropin
test
was
superior
to
standard-dose
test
(AUC
094
and
085
respectively
P<0001)
Low-dose
corticotropin
test
was
superior
to
standard-dose
test
for
diagnosing
chronic
HPAI
although
it
has
technical
limitations
