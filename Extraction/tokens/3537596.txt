Prevention
of
recurrent
acute

chemoprophylaxis
versus
tympanostomy
tubes
Abstract
Text
Otitis
media
has
long
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
most
common
diseases
of
childhood
Several
therapeutic
modalities
have
been
advocated
for
the
prevention
of
recurrent
episodes
of
acute
otitis
media
(AOM)
A
blinded
prospective
randomized
study
was
designed
to
determine
the
efficacy
of
tympanostomy
tubes
antibiotic
prophylaxis
and
placebo
Children
with
recurrent
AOM
were
entered
in
the
study
and
followed
for
at
least
6
months
A
total
of
65
children
completed
the
protocol
Sixty-three
of
those
were
under
the
age
of
4
years
Treatment
failure
was
defined
as
two
or
more
episodes
of
AOM
or
otorrhea
in
less
than
3
months
Five
of
22
children
in
the
tympanostomy
tube
group
failed
compared
to
12
of
20
in
the
placebo
group
(p
=
02)
There
were
8
or
21
treatment
failures
in
the
sulfisoxazole
group
Children
with
otitis
media
with
effusion
(OME)
at
the
time
of
their
initial
visit
had
significantly
less
middle
ear
disease
when
treated
with
tympanostomy
tubes
Tympanostomy
tube
insertion
for
prophylaxis
of
recurrent
acute
otitis
is
supported
by
these
findings
Improvement
of
recurrent
AOM
was
observed
in
the
sulfisoxazole
group
but
was
not
statistically
significant
