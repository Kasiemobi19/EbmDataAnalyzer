Reduced
osmolarity
oral
rehydration
solution
for
treating
dehydration
caused
by
acute
diarrhoea
in
children
Abstract
Text
Oral
rehydration
solution
(ORS)
has
reduced
childhood
deaths
from
diarrhoea
in
many
countries
Recent
studies
suggest
that
the
currently
recommended
formulation
of
ORS
recommended
by
the
World
Health
Organization
(WHO)
may
not
be
optimal
and
solutions
that
contain
lower
concentrations
of
sodium
and
glucose
may
be
more
effective
To
compare
reduced
osmolarity
ORS
with
WHO
standard
ORS
in
children
with
acute
diarrhoea

Randomized
controlled
trials
comparing
reduced
osmolarity
ORS
with
the
WHO
standard
ORS
formulation
The
primary
outcome
was
unscheduled
intravenous
fluid
infusion
Secondary
outcomes
were
measures
of
clinical
illness
Two
reviewers
extracted
data
We
tested
for
heterogeneity
using
the
Chi-square
statistic
conducted
sensitivity
analysis
by
allocation
concealment
and
the
regression
approach
to
assess
funnel
plot
asymmetry
from
selective
trial
publication
The
primary
outcome
unscheduled
intravenous
fluid
infusion
was
reported
in
11
trials
In
a
meta-analysis
of
8
trials
reduced
osmolarity
ORS
was
associated
with
fewer
unscheduled
intravenous
fluid
infusions
compared
with
WHO
standard
ORS
(Mantel

to

with
no
evidence
for
heterogeneity
between
trials
No
unscheduled
intravenous
fluid
infusion
therapy
was
required
in
any
participant
in
three
trials
Eleven
trials
reported
stool
output
and
data
suggested
less
stool
output
in
the
reduced
osmolarity
ORS
group
Vomiting
was
less
frequent
in
the
reduced
osmolarity
group
in
the
six
trials
reporting
this
Six
trials
sought
hyponatraemia
with
events
in
three
studies
but
no
obvious
difference
between
the
two
arms
In
children
admitted
to
hospital
with
diarrhoea
reduced
osmolarity
ORS
when
compared
to
WHO
standard
ORS
is
associated
with
fewer
unscheduled
intravenous
fluid
infusions
lower
stool
volume
post
randomization
and
less
vomiting
No
additional
risk
of
developing
hyponatraemia
when
compared
with
WHO
standard
ORS
was
detected
