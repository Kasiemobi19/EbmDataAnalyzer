Lack
of
efficacy
of
6-week
treatment
with
oral
terbinafine
for
tinea
capitis
due
to
Microsporum
canis
in
children
Abstract
Text
Twenty-two
children
aged
2
to
9
years
with
noninflammatory
tinea
capitis
due
to
Microsporum
canis
were
evaluated
in
an
open
clinical
pilot
study
run
from
January
1994
to
July
1995
Each
child
was
given
oral
terbinafine
according
to
body
weight
for
6
weeks
Mycologic
evaluation
was
done
at
the
end
of
treatment
and
after
follow-up
periods
of
4
and
8
weeks
None
of
the
patients
achieved
complete
mycologic
cure
by
the
end
of
the
treatment
period
Four
weeks
later
complete
mycologic
cure
was
established
in
nine
patients
and
on
final
evaluation
in
seven
The
treatment
was
very
well
tolerated
by
all
the
children
No
systemic
adverse
effects
were
noted
According
to
our
data
a
6-week
course
of
oral
terbinafine
is
inadequate
for
tinea
capitis
due
to
M
canis
in
children
Further
study
is
needed
to
determine
the
most
appropriate
duration
of
therapy
