Decreased
prevalence
of
Alzheimer
disease
associated
with
3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl
coenzyme
A
reductase
inhibitors
Abstract
Text
Increasing
evidence
suggests
that
cholesterol
plays
a
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
Alzheimer
disease
(AD)
For
instance
an
elevated
serum
cholesterol
level
has
been
shown
to
be
a
risk
factor
for
AD
To
determine
whether
patients
taking
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
reductase
inhibitors
(statins)
which
are
a
group
of
medicines
that
inhibit
the
synthesis
of
cholesterol
have
a
lower
prevalence
of
probable
AD
The
experiment
uses
a
cross-sectional
analysis
comparing
the
prevalence
of
probable
AD
in
3
groups
of
patients
from
hospital
records
the
entire
population
patients
receiving
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
reductase
inhibitors
(hereafter
referred
to
as
the
statins)
and
patients
receiving
medications
used
to
treat
hypertension
or
cardiovascular
disease
The
subjects
studied
were
those
included
in
the
computer
databases
of
3
different
hospitals
for
the
years
October
1
1996
through
August
31
1998
Diagnosis
of
probable
AD
We
find
that
the
prevalence
of
probable
AD
in
the
cohort
taking
statins
during
the
study
interval
is
60%
to
73%
(P
<
001)
lower
than
the
total
patient
population
or
compared
with
patients
taking
other
medications
typically
used
in
the
treatment
of
hypertension
or
cardiovascular
disease
There
is
a
lower
prevalence
of
diagnosed
probable
AD
in
patients
taking
2
different
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
reductase
inhibitors-lovastatin
and
pravastatin
While
one
cannot
infer
causative
mechanisms
based
on
these
data
this
study
reveals
an
interesting
association
in
the
data
which
warrants
further
study
