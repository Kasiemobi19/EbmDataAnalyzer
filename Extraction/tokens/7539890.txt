Abstract
Text
Asymptomatic
ventricular
arrhythmias
in
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
are
associated
with
increased
rates
of
overall
mortality
and
sudden
death
Amiodarone
is
now
used
widely
to
prevent
ventricular
tachycardia
and
fibrillation
We
conducted
a
trial
to
determine
whether
amiodarone
can
reduce
overall
mortality
in
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
and
asymptomatic
ventricular
arrhythmias
We
used
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
protocol
in
which
674
patients
with
symptoms
of
congestive
heart
failure
cardiac
enlargement
10
or
more
premature
ventricular
contractions
per
hour
and
a
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
of
40
percent
or
less
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
amiodarone
(336
patients)
or
placebo
(338
patients)
The
primary
end
point
was
overall
mortality
and
the
median
follow-up
was
45
months
(range
0
to
54)
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
overall
mortality
between
the
two
treatment
groups
(P
=
06)
The
two-year
actuarial
survival
rate
was
694
percent
(95
percent
confidence
interval
642
to
746)
for
the
patients
in
the
amiodarone
group
and
708
percent
(95
percent
confidence
interval
657
to
759)
for
those
in
the
placebo
group
At
two
years
the
rate
of
sudden
death
was
15
percent
in
the
amiodarone
group
and
19
percent
in
the
placebo
group
(P
=
043)
There
was
a
trend
toward
a
reduction
in
overall
mortality
among
the
patients
with
nonischemic
cardiomyopathy
who
received
amiodarone
(P
=
007)
Amiodarone
was
significantly
more
effective
in
suppressing
ventricular
arrhythmias
and
increased
the
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
by
42
percent
at
two
years
Although
amiodarone
was
effective
in
suppressing
ventricular
arrhythmias
and
improving
ventricular
function
it
did
not
reduce
the
incidence
of
sudden
death
or
prolong
survival
among
patients
with
heart
failure
except
for
a
trend
toward
reduced
mortality
among
those
with
nonischemic
cardiomyopathy
