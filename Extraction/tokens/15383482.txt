Abstract
Text
This
chapter
about
treatment
and
prevention
of
stroke
is
part
of
the
7th
ACCP
Conference
on
Antithrombotic
and
Thrombolytic
Therapy
Evidence
Based
Guidelines
Grade
1
recommendations
are
strong
and
indicate
that
the
benefits
do
or
do
not
outweigh
risks
burden
and
costs
Grade
2
suggests
that
individual
patients'
values
may
lead
to
different
choices
(for
a
full
understanding
of
the
grading
see
Guyatt
et
al)
Among
the
key
recommendations
in
this
chapter
are
the
following
For
patients
with
acute
ischemic
stroke
(AIS)
we
recommend
administration
of
iv
tissue
plasminogen
activator
(tPA)
if
treatment
is
initiated
within
3
h
of
clearly
defined
symptom
onset
(Grade
1A)
For
patients
with
extensive
and
clearly
identifiable
hypodensity
on
CT
we
recommend
against
thrombolytic
therapy
(Grade
1B)
For
unselected
patients
with
AIS
of
>
3
h
but
<
6
h
we
suggest
clinicians
not
use
iv
tPA
(Grade
2A)
For
patients
with
AIS
we
recommend
against
streptokinase
(Grade
1A)
and
suggest
clinicians
not
use
full-dose
anticoagulation
with
iv
or
subcutaneous
heparins
or
heparinoids
(Grade
2B)
For
patients
with
AIS
who
are
not
receiving
thrombolysis
we
recommend
early
aspirin
therapy
160
to
325
mg
qd
(Grade
1A)
For
AIS
patients
with
restricted
mobility
we
recommend
prophylactic
low-dose
subcutaneous
heparin
or
low
molecular
weight
heparins
or
heparinoids
(Grade
1A)
and
for
patients
who
have
contraindications
to
anticoagulants
we
recommend
use
of
intermittent
pneumatic
compression
devices
or
elastic
stockings
(Grade
1C)
In
patients
with
acute
intracerebral
hematoma
we
recommend
the
initial
use
of
intermittent
pneumatic
compression
(Grade
1C+)
In
patients
with
noncardioembolic
stroke
or
transient
ischemic
attack
(TIA)
[ie
atherothrombotic
lacunar
or
cryptogenic]
we
recommend
treatment
with
an
antiplatelet
agent
(Grade
1A)
including
aspirin
50
to
325
mg
qd
the
combination
of
aspirin
and
extended-release
dipyridamole
25
mg/200
mg
bid
or
clopidogrel
75
mg
qd
In
these
patients
we
suggest
use
of
the
combination
of
aspirin
and
extended-release
dipyridamole
25/200
mg
bid
over
aspirin
(Grade
2A)
and
clopidogrel
over
aspirin
(Grade
2B)
For
patients
who
are
allergic
to
aspirin
we
recommend
clopidogrel
(Grade
1C+)
In
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
and
a
recent
stroke
or
TIA
we
recommend
long-term
oral
anticoagulation
(target
international
normalized
ratio
25
range
20
to
30)
[Grade
1A]
In
patients
with
venous
sinus
thrombosis
we
recommend
unfractionated
heparin
(Grade
1B)
or
low
molecular
weight
heparin
(Grade
1B)
over
no
anticoagulant
therapy
during
the
acute
phase
