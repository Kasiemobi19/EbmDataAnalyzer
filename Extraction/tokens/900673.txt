Title
Chronic
excessive
acetaminophen
use
and
liver
damage
Abstract
Text
Severe
often
fatal
liver
damage
results
from
extreme
overdosage
with
acetaminophen
In
usual
dosage
it
is
considered
harmless
We
describe
three
cases
of
toxic
hepatitis
associated
with
the
chronic
ingestion
of
excessive
doses
of
acetaminophen
Each
patient
took
approximately
5
to
8
g
of
acetaminophen
per
day
during
a
period
of
several
weeks
The
transient
elevations
of
serum
hepatocellular
enzyme
concentrations
and
the
histologic
evidence
of
a
toxic
hepatitis
suggest
the
liver
damage
was
related
to
the
use
of
acetaminophen
Alcohol
abuse
in
one
patient
and
negative
nitrogen
balance
in
another
may
have
increased
the
susceptibility
to
acetaminophen
toxicity
With
the
increasing
popularity
of
acetaminophen
for
mild
pain
relief
hepatotoxicity
from
acute
or
chronic
ingestion
may
be
more
common
than
previously
recognized
especially
in
those
patients
with
predisposing
conditions
