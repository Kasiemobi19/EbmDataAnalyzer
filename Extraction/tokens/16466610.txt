Title
Efficacy
and
tolerability
of
twice-daily
pregabalin
for
treating
pain
and
related
sleep
interference
in
postherpetic
neuralgia
a
13-week
randomized
trial
Abstract
Text
This
trial
evaluated
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
pregabalin
dosed
twice
daily
(BID)
for
relief
of
neuro-pathic
pain
associated
with
postherpetic
neuralgia
(PHN)
The
13-week
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study
randomized
370
patients
with
PHN
to
pregabalin
(150
300
or
600
mg/day
BID)
or
placebo
Primary
efficacy
measure
was
endpoint
mean
pain
score
from
daily
pain
diaries
Secondary
efficacy
measures
included
endpoint
mean
sleep-interference
score
from
daily
sleep
diaries
and
Patient
Global
Impression
of
Change
(PGIC)
Safety
evaluations
included
adverse
events
(AEs)
physical
and
neurologic
examinations
12-lead
ECG
vital
signs
and
laboratory
testing
Pregabalin
provided
significant
dose-proportional
pain
relief
at
endpoint
difference
from
placebo
in
mean
pain
score
150
mg/day
-088
p
=
00077
300
mg/day
-107
p
=
00016
600
mg/day
-179
p
=
00003
Weekly
mean
pain
scores
significantly
improved
as
early
as
week
1
Sleep
interference
in
all
pregabalin
groups
was
also
significantly
improved
at
endpoint
compared
with
placebo
(p
<
0001)
beginning
at
week
1
(p
<
001)
At
study
termination
patients
in
the
150
(p
=
002)
and
600
mg/day
(p
=
0003)
groups
were
more
likely
to
report
global
improvement
than
were
those
in
the
placebo
group
Most
AEs
were
mild
or
moderate
Among
pregabalin-treated
patients
135%
withdrew
due
to
AEs
most
commonly
for
dizziness
(16
patients
58%)
somnolence
(8
29%)
or
ataxia
(7
25%)
Pregabalin
dosed
BID
reduced
neuropathic
pain
associated
with
PHN
and
was
well
tolerated
It
also
reduced
the
extent
to
which
pain
interfered
with
sleep
Pregabalin's
effects
were
seen
as
early
as
week
1
and
were
sustained
throughout
the
13-week
study
