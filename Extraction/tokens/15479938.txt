Title
Bariatric
surgery
a
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
About
5%
of
the
US
population
is
morbidly
obese
This
disease
remains
largely
refractory
to
diet
and
drug
therapy
but
generally
responds
well
to
bariatric
surgery
To
determine
the
impact
of
bariatric
surgery
on
weight
loss
operative
mortality
outcome
and
4
obesity
comorbidities
(diabetes
hyperlipidemia
hypertension
and
obstructive
sleep
apnea)

MEDLINE
Current

plus

checks
of
all
articles
on
bariatric
surgery
published
in
the
English
language
between
1990
and
2003
Two
levels
of
screening
were
used
on
2738
citations
A
total
of
136
fully
extracted
studies
which
included
91
overlapping
patient
populations
(kin
studies)
were
included
for
a
total
of
22094
patients
Nineteen
percent
of
the
patients
were
men
and
726%
were
women
with
a
mean
age
of
39
years
(range
16-64
years)
Sex
was
not
reported
for
1537
patients
(8%)
The
baseline
mean
body
mass
index
for
16
944
patients
was
469
(range
323-688)
A
random
effects
model
was
used
in
the
meta-analysis
The
mean
(95%
confidence
interval)
percentage
of
excess
weight
loss
was
612%
(581%-644%)
for
all
patients
475%
(407%-542%)
for
patients
who
underwent
gastric
banding
616%
(567%-665%)
gastric
bypass
682%
(615%-748%)
gastroplasty
and
701%
(663%-739%)
biliopancreatic
diversion
or
duodenal
switch
Operative
mortality
(<
or
=30
days)
in
the
extracted
studies
was
01%
for
the
purely
restrictive
procedures
05%
for
gastric
bypass
and
11%
for
biliopancreatic
diversion
or
duodenal
switch
Diabetes
was
completely
resolved
in
768%
of
patients
and
resolved
or
improved
in
860%
Hyperlipidemia
improved
in
70%
or
more
of
patients
Hypertension
was
resolved
in
617%
of
patients
and
resolved
or
improved
in
785%
Obstructive
sleep
apnea
was
resolved
in
857%
of
patients
and
was
resolved
or
improved
in
836%
of
patients
Effective
weight
loss
was
achieved
in
morbidly
obese
patients
after
undergoing
bariatric
surgery
A
substantial
majority
of
patients
with
diabetes
hyperlipidemia
hypertension
and
obstructive
sleep
apnea
experienced
complete
resolution
or
improvement
