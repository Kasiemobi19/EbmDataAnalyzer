Title
How
much
isoniazid
is
needed
for
prevention
of
tuberculosis
among
immunocompetent
adults
Abstract
Text
Recommendations
regarding
how
long
isoniazid
should
be
taken
to
prevent
tuberculosis
have
gradually
shifted
from
12
to
6
months
of
treatment
These
recommendations
and
the
relevant
evidence
from
controlled
trials
on
duration
of
treatment
are
reviewed
The
conclusions
for
immunocompetent
adults
are
1)
6
months
of
preventive
treatment
does
not
give
optimal
protection
2)
more
than
12
months
of
preventive
treatment
is
not
necessary
3)
9-10
months
appears
to
be
the
optimal
duration
and
4)
total
duration
of
preventive
treatment
may
be
more
important
than
its
continuity
