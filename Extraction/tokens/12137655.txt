Title
Anti-leukotriene
agents
compared
to
inhaled
corticosteroids
in
the
management
of
recurrent
and/or
chronic
asthma
in
adults
and
children
Abstract
Text
Anti-leukotrienes
agents
are
currently
being
studied
as
alternative
first
line
agents
to
inhaled
corticosteroids
in
mild
to
moderate
chronic
asthma
To
compare
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
anti-leukotriene
agents
with
inhaled
glucocorticoids
(ICS)
and
to
determine
the
dose-equivalence
of
anti-leukotrienes
to
daily
dose
of
ICS
Medline
(1966
to
Jan
2002)
Embase
(1980
to
Jan
2002)
and
Cinahl
(1982
to
Jan
2002)
were
searched
and
reference
lists
of
review
articles
and
trials
We
contacted
colleagues
and
international
headquarters
of
anti-leukotrienes
producers
Randomised
controlled
trials
that
compared
leukotriene
antagonists
with
inhaled
corticosteroids
during
a
minimal
30-day
intervention
period
in
asthmatic
patients
aged
2
years
and
older
Two
reviewers
performed
assessments
of
methodological
quality
and
data
extraction
independently
and
blindly
The
primary
outcome
was
the
rate
of
exacerbations
requiring
systemic
corticosteroids
Secondary
outcomes
included
lung
function
indices
of
chronic
asthma
control
adverse
effects
and
withdrawal
rates
14
trials
met
the
inclusion
criteria
10
were
of
high
methodological
quality
8

All
were
in
mild-to-moderate
chronic
asthma
Two
included
children
or
adolescents
Trial
duration
was
4
-
37
weeks
In
most
trials
daily
dose
of
ICS
was
400
mcg
of
beclomethasone-equivalent
Patients
treated
with
anti-leukotrienes
were
60%
more
likely
to
suffer
an
exacerbation
requiring
systemic
steroids

Other
significant
benefits
of
ICS
were
seen
for
nocturnal
awakenings
rescue
medication
use
and
quality
of
life
Risk
of
side
effects
was
not
different
between
groups
but
anti-leukotriene
therapy
was
associated
with
30%
increased
risk
of
"withdrawals
for
any
cause"
or
"withdrawals
due
to
poor
asthma
control"
For
most
asthma
outcomes
ICS
at
400
mcg/day
of
beclomethasone-equivalent
are
more
effective
than
anti-leukotriene
agents
given
in
the
usual
licensed
doses
The
exact
dose-equivalence
of
anti-leukotriene
agents
in
mcg
of
ICS
remains
to
be
determined
