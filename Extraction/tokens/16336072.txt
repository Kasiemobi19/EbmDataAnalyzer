Self-weighing
in
weight
gain
prevention
and
weight
loss
trials
Abstract
Text
Although
self-monitoring
is
a
central
tenet
of
behavioral
approaches
to
changing
health
behavior
clinical
and
public
health
recommendations
for
better
controlling
body
weight
do
not
emphasize
weight
self-monitoring
The
objective
was
to
determine
whether
more
frequent
self-weighing
exerts
a
positive
influence
on
weight
loss
or
weight
gain
prevention
This
study
examined
cross-sectional
and
longitudinal
associations
between
self-weighing
frequency
and
weight
in
two
distinct
groups
1226
adults
who
were
enrolled
in
a
weight
gain
prevention
trial
and
1800
adults
who
were
enrolled
in
a
weight
loss
trial
Although
the
samples
differed
significantly
in
weight
and
baseline
demographic
characteristics
the
distribution
of
baseline
weighing
frequencies
did
not
differ
by
study
In
both
groups
more
frequent
self-weighing
at
baseline
was
associated
with
greater
age
lower
fat
intake
White
ethnicity
current
nonsmoking
status
a
greater
history
of
dieting
to
lose
weight
and
lower
current
body
mass
index
Despite
similar
weighing
instructions
differential
patterns
of
weighing
frequency
over
time
were
observed
Weight
loss
dieters
increased
weighing
over
time
regardless
of
treatment
group
(control
or
intervention)
whereas
weight
gain
preventers
decreased
weighing
over
time
in
the
control
group
and
increased
weighing
over
time
in
intervention
groups
Most
important
higher
weighing
frequency
was
associated
with
greater
24-month
weight
loss
or
less
weight
gain
Results
support
the
idea
that
daily
weighing
is
valuable
to
individuals
trying
to
lose
weight
or
prevent
weight
gain
Daily
self-weighing
should
be
emphasized
in
clinical
and
public
health
messages
about
weight
control
Experimental
studies
on
the
effects
of
weighing
frequency
in
these
contexts
are
recommended
