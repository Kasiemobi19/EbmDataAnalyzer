Abstract
Text
The
primary
objective
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
a
hydroxymethylglutaryl-
CoA
reductase
inhibitor
(HMG)
tablet-splitting
program
on
laboratory
outcomes
(lipid
panel
and
liver
enzyme
tests)
Other
objectives
were
to
assess
patient
compliance
and
satisfaction
with
splitting
tablets
and
to
measure
the
reduction
in
drug
acquisition
costs
Patients
at
a
Veterans
Affairs
Health
Care
System
facility
were
included
in
this
study
if
they
participated
in
the
HMG
tablet-splitting
program
between
April
and
September
2000
Patients
taking
the
same
drug
and
dosage
before
and
after
implementation
of
the
program
were
asked
to
complete
a
mailed
questionnaire
designed
to
measure
satisfaction
and
compliance
with
the
program
Data
collected
through
electronic
charts
included
patient
demographics
prescribed
medication
and
the
values
for
lipid
panel
and
liver
function
tests
A
total
of
2019
patients
were
included
in
the
study
The
total
cost
avoidance
achieved
over
one
year
for
atorvastatin
lovastatin
and
simvastatin
was
138108
dollars
(N=2019)
The
majority
of
patients
who
responded
to
the
questionnaire
were
satisfied
and
compliant
with
tablet
splitting
In
the
laboratory
analysis
(N=512)
there
was
no
difference
between
prevalues
and
postvalues
for
total
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
There
was
a
statistically
but
not
clinically
significant
decrease
in
LDL
(102
versus
97
P<0001)
and
increase
in
HDL
(46
versus
48
P<0001)
AST
(26
versus
28
P<0001)
and
ALT
(24
versus
26
P=0006)
after
the
initiation
of
tablet
splitting
Tablet
splitting
of
HMGs
had
no
short-term
negative
effects
on
laboratory
outcomes
and
favorable
effects
on
humanistic
outcomes
as
measured
by
patient
satisfaction
and
compliance
Tablet
splitting
of
HMGs
is
an
effective
way
to
reduce
costs
and
nearly
double
the
number
of
patients
who
can
be
treated
for
the
same
expense
