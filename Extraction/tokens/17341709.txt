Title
Computed
tomography
screening
and
lung
cancer
outcomes
Abstract
Text
Current
and
former
smokers
are
currently
being
screened
for
lung
cancer
with
computed
tomography
(CT)
although
there
are
limited
data
on
the
effect
screening
has
on
lung
cancer
outcomes
Randomized
controlled
trials
assessing
CT
screening
are
currently
under
way
To
assess
whether
screening
may
increase
the
frequency
of
lung
cancer
diagnosis
and
lung
cancer
resection
or
may
reduce
the
risk
of
a
diagnosis
of
advanced
lung
cancer
or
death
from
lung
cancer
Longitudinal
analysis
of
3246
asymptomatic
current
or
former
smokers
screened
for
lung
cancer
beginning
in
1998
either
at
1
of
2
academic
medical
centers
in
the
United
States
or
an
academic
medical
center
in
Italy
with
follow-up
for
a
median
of
39
years
Annual
CT
scans
with
comprehensive
evaluation
and
treatment
of
detected
nodules
Comparison
of
predicted
with
observed
number
of
new
lung
cancer
cases
lung
cancer
resections
advanced
lung
cancer
cases
and
deaths
from
lung
cancer
There
were
144
individuals
diagnosed
with
lung
cancer
compared
with
445
expected
cases
(relative
risk
[RR]
32
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
27-38
P<001)
There
were
109
individuals
who
had
a
lung
resection
compared
with
109
expected
cases
(RR
100
95%
CI
82-119
P<001)
There
was
no
evidence
of
a
decline
in
the
number
of
diagnoses
of
advanced
lung
cancers
(42
individuals
compared
with
334
expected
cases)
or
deaths
from
lung
cancer
(38
deaths
due
to
lung
cancer
observed
and
388
expected
RR
10
95%
CI
07-13
P

90)
Screening
for
lung
cancer
with
low-dose
CT
may
increase
the
rate
of
lung
cancer
diagnosis
and
treatment
but
may
not
meaningfully
reduce
the
risk
of
advanced
lung
cancer
or
death
from
lung
cancer
Until
more
conclusive
data
are
available
asymptomatic
individuals
should
not
be
screened
outside
of
clinical
research
studies
that
have
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
further
clarifying
the
potential
benefits
and
risks
