Title
EFNS
guidelines
on
pharmacological
treatment
of
neuropathic
pain
Abstract
Text
Neuropathic
pain
treatment
remains
unsatisfactory
despite
a
substantial
increase
in
the
number
of
trials
This
EFNS
Task
Force
aimed
at
evaluating
the
existing
evidence
about
the
pharmacological
treatment
of
neuropathic
pain
Studies
were
identified
using
first
the
Cochrane
Database
then
Medline
Trials
were
classified
according
to
the
aetiological
condition
All
class
I
and
II
controlled
trials
(according
to
EFNS
classification
of
evidence)
were
assessed
but
lower-class
studies
were
considered
in
conditions
that
had
no
top
level
studies
Only
treatments
feasible
in
an
outpatient
setting
were
evaluated
Effects
on
pain
symptoms/signs
quality
of
life
and
comorbidities
were
particularly
searched
for
Most
of
the
randomized
controlled
trials
included
patients
with
postherpetic
neuralgia
(PHN)
and
painful
polyneuropathies
(PPN)
mainly
caused
by
diabetes
These
trials
provide
level
A
evidence
for
the
efficacy
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
gabapentin
pregabalin
and
opioids
with
a
large
number
of
class
I
trials
followed
by
topical
lidocaine
(in
PHN)
and
the
newer
antidepressants
venlafaxine
and
duloxetine
(in
PPN)
A
small
number
of
controlled
trials
were
performed
in
central
pain
trigeminal
neuralgia
other
peripheral
neuropathic
pain
states
and
multiple-aetiology
neuropathic
pains
The
main
peripheral
pain
conditions
respond
similarly
well
to
tricyclic
antidepressants
gabapentin
and
pregabalin
but
some
conditions
such
as
HIV-associated
polyneuropathy
are
more
refractory
There
are
too
few
studies
on
central
pain
combination
therapy
and
head-to-head
comparison
For
future
trials
we
recommend
to
assess
quality
of
life
and
pain
symptoms
or
signs
with
standardized
tools
