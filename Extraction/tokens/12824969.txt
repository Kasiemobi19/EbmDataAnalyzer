Abstract
Text
This
study
was
undertaken
to
compare
postcolposcopy
management
strategies
for
women
referred
for
low-grade
squamous
intraepithelial
lesions
(LSIL)
or
oncogenic
human
papillomavirus
(HPV)
DNA-positive
atypical
squamous
cells
of
undetermined
significance
(ASCUS)
with
cervical
intraepithelial
neoplasia
(CIN)
grade
1
or
less
found
at
initial
colposcopy
A
2-year
prospective
follow-up
of
1539
women
was
designed
to
assess
the
percentage
sensitivity
of
different
postcolposcopy
management
strategies
to
detect
subsequent
CIN
grade
2
or
3
and
percentage
referral
to
repeat
colposcopy
HPV
testing
at
12
months
was
sensitive
(922%)
for
detection
of
CIN
grade
2
or
3
with
a
referral
rate
to
repeat
colposcopy
of
550%
Repeat
semiannual
cytology
with
referral
to
colposcopy
at
an
ASCUS
threshold
demonstrated
similar
sensitivity
(880%)
but
with
a
higher
rate
of
referral
to
colposcopy
(636%)
Combining
cytology
and
HPV
testing
did
not
increase
sensitivity
and
hurt
specificity
Baseline
viral
load
and
colposcopic
impression
were
not
helpful
The
most
efficient
test
for
identifying
women
with
CIN
grade
2
or
3
after
colposcopy
might
be
an
HPV
test
alone
at
12
months
