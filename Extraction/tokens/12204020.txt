Abstract
Text
To
synthesize
new
data
on
breast
cancer
screening
for
the
US
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
MEDLINE
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Registry
and
reference
lists
of
reviews
editorials
and
original
studies
Eight
randomized
controlled
trials
of
mammography
and
2
trials
evaluating
breast
self-examination
were
included
One
hundred
fifty-four
publications
of
the
results
of
these
trials
as
well
as
selected
articles
about
the
test
characteristics
and
harms
associated
with
screening
were
examined
Predefined
criteria
were
used
to
assess
the
quality
of
each
study
Meta-analyses
using
a
Bayesian
random-effects
model
were
conducted
to
provide
summary
relative
risk
estimates
and
credible
intervals
(CrIs)
for
the
effectiveness
of
screening
with
mammography
in
reducing
death
from
breast
cancer
For
studies
of
fair
quality
or
better
the
summary
relative
risk
was
084
(95%
CrI
077
to
091)
and
the
number
needed
to
screen
to
prevent
one
death
from
breast
cancer
after
approximately
14
years
of
observation
was
1224
(CrI
665
to
2564)
Among
women
younger
than
50
years
of
age
the
summary
relative
risk
associated
with
mammography
was
085
(CrI
073
to
099)
and
the
number
needed
to
screen
to
prevent
one
death
from
breast
cancer
after
14
years
of
observation
was
1792
(CrI
764
to
10
540)
For
clinical
breast
examination
and
breast
self-examination
evidence
from
randomized
trials
is
inconclusive
In
the
randomized
controlled
trials
mammography
reduced
breast
cancer
mortality
rates
among
women
40
to
74
years
of
age
Greater
absolute
risk
reduction
was
seen
among
older
women
Because
these
results
incorporate
several
rounds
of
screening
the
actual
number
of
mammograms
needed
to
prevent
one
death
from
breast
cancer
is
higher
In
addition
each
screening
has
associated
risks
and
costs
