Use
of
the
Cytobrush
for
Papanicolaou
smear
screens
in
pregnant
women
Abstract
Text
A
prospective
randomized
clinical
trial
was
conducted
to
study
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
the
Cytobrush
for
Papanicolaou
smear
screens
in
252
pregnant
women
Two
groups-Ayre
spatula
plus
Cytobrush
and
Ayre
spatula
plus
cotton
swab-were
compared
There
was
a
higher
incidence
of
spotting
with
each
of
the
three
devices
as
compared
with
studies
of
nonpregnant
women
The
highest
incidence
of
spotting
at
time
of
exam
occurred
with
the
Cytobrush
however
this
spotting
was
not
clinically
significant
Eleven
first-trimester
women
experienced
a
pregnancy
loss
five
of
these
losses
were
due
to
a
hydatidiform
mole
or
missed
abortion
that
occurred
before
the
exam
Six
women
(2%)
aborted
spontaneously
compared
with
a
10%
incidence
reported
in
the
literature
It
was
concluded
that
all
three
devices
are
safe
for
use
in
pregnancy
In
addition
the
most
adequate
screen
for
retrieval
of
squamous
epithelial
cells
was
found
to
be
the
Ayre
spatula
while
the
Cytobrush
proved
most
effective
for
retrieval
of
endocervical
epithelial
cells
