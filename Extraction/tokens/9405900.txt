Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
relative
value
of
plasma
glucose
(PG)
at
different
time
points
in
assessing
glucose
control
of
type
2
diabetic
patients
Glycemic
profiles
ie
PG
at
prebreakfast
(800
AM)
prelunch
(1100
AM)
postlunch
(200
PM)
and
extended
postlunch
(500
PM)
times
over
the
same
day
were
obtained
in
66
type
2
diabetic
patients
on
an
ambulatory
basis
The
different
time
points
of
PG
were
compared
with
a
measurement
of
HbA1c
made
in
a
reference
laboratory
Extended
postlunch
PG
was
lower
than
prebreakfast
PG
(104
+/-
21
vs
133
+/-
35
mg/dl
P
<
002)
in
patients
demonstrating
good
diabetic
control
(HbA1c
<
or
=
70%)
was
not
different
from
prebreakfast
PG
(149
+/-
47
vs
166
+/-
26
mg/dl
NS)
in
patients
demonstrating
fair
diabetic
control
(70%
<
HbA1c
<
or
=
85%)
and
was
higher
than
prebreakfast
PG
(221
+/-
62
vs
199
+/-
49
mg/dl
P
<
or
=
001)
in
those
demonstrating
poor
diabetic
control
(HbA1c
<
or
=
85%)
Prebreakfast
prelunch
postlunch
and
extended
postlunch
PG
values
were
all
significantly
correlated
with
HbA1c
Multiple
linear
regression
analysis
demonstrated
that
postlunch
PG
and
extended
postlunch
PG
correlated
significantly
and
independently
with
HbA1c
but
that
prebreakfast
PG
and
prelunch
PG
did
not
Moreover
postlunch
PG
and
extended
postlunch
PG
demonstrated
better
sensitivity
specificity
and
positive
predictive
value
in
predicting
poor
glycemic
control
than
did
prebreakfast
PG
or
prelunch
PG
In
type
2
diabetes
postlunch
PG
and
extended
postlunch
PG
are
better
predictors
of
glycemic
control
than
fasting
plasma
glucose
(FPG)
We
therefore
suggest
that
they
be
more
widely
used
to
supplement
or
substitute
for
FPG
in
evaluating
the
metabolic
control
of
type
2
diabetic
patients
