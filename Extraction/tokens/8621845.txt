Effects
of
nedocromil
sodium
in
steroid-resistant
asthma
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Some
patients
with
asthma
respond
poorly
to
corticosteroids
and
have
persistent
airway
inflammation
and
daily
clinical
symptoms
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
nedocromil
sodium
(NS)
a
nonsteroidal
antinflamatory
drug
in
the
treatment
of
steroid-resistant
asthma
Steroid-resistant
asthma
as
diagnosed
in
any
patient
who
demonstrated
20%
improvement
in
FEV1
after
treatment
with
inhaled
salbutamol
with
failure
of
FEV1
to
improve
by
at
least
15%
after
a
2-week
trial
of
prednisolone
30
mg
daily
In
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
the
patients
received
either
4
mg
of
inhaled
NS
(n
=
13)
or
placebo
(n
=
13)
4
times
daily
for
3
months
NS
but
not
placebo
resulted
in
a
mean
increase
in
FEV1
of
114%
after
12
weeks
of
therapy
(p
=
005)
and
of
124%
(p
=
004)
and
15%
(002)
in
morning
peak
expiratory
flow
after
8
and
12
weeks
of
treatment
respectively
Changes
in
FEV1
at
4
and
8
weeks
and
in
peak
expiratory
flow
at
4
weeks
of
NS
therapy
were
not
significant
NS
was
also
effective
in
reducing
variability
of
peak
expiratory
flow
(p
=
002)
and
use
of
salbutamol
(p
=
0005)
and
in
improving
quality
of
life
(p
=
0007)
by
the
trial
end
Six
of
the
12
patients
treated
with
NS
who
completed
the
treatment
period
showed
a
"good
response"
defined
by
a
reduction
in
salbutamol
use
of
more
than
50%
and
an
increase
in
morning
peak
expiratory
flow
of
more
than
20%
from
baseline
there
were
no
clinical
predictors
of
this
response
Two
patients
were
withdrawn
from
the
study
because
of
severe
asthma
exacerbation
(one
from
each
treatment
group)
Inhaled
NS
improved
pulmonary
function
and
decreased
asthma
severity
in
steroid-resistant
asthma
but
its
effectiveness
is
not
homogeneous
and
cannot
be
predicted
from
baseline
clinical
data
