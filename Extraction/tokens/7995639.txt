Abstract
Text
To
determine
the
prognostic
significance
of
ambulatory
blood
pressure
we
prospectively
followed
for
up
to
75
years
(mean
32)
1187
subjects
with
essential
hypertension
and
205
healthy
normotensive
control
subjects
who
had
baseline
off-therapy
24-hour
noninvasive
ambulatory
blood
pressure
monitoring
Prevalence
of
white
coat
hypertension
defined
by
an
average
daytime
ambulatory
blood
pressure
lower
than
131/86
mm
Hg
in
women
and
136/87
mm
Hg
in
men
in
clinically
hypertensive
subjects
was

Cardiovascular
morbidity
expressed
as
the
number
of
combined
fatal
and
nonfatal
cardiovascular
events
per
100
patient-years
was
047
in
the
normotensive
group
049
in
the
white
coat
hypertension
group
179
in
dippers
with
ambulatory
hypertension
and
499
in
nondippers
with
ambulatory
hypertension
After
adjustment
for
traditional
risk
markers
for
cardiovascular
disease
morbidity
did
not
differ
between
the
normotensive
and
white
coat
hypertension
groups
(P
=
83)
Compared
with
the
white
coat
hypertension
group
cardiovascular
morbidity
increased
in
ambulatory
hypertension
in
dippers
(relative
risk

95%
confidence
interval
113
to
125)
with
a
further
increase
of
morbidity
in
nondippers
(relative
risk
626
95%
confidence
interval
192
to
2032)
After

(relative

versus
subjects
with
normal
left
ventricular
mass
182
95%

interval
102
to

cardiovascular
morbidity
in
ambulatory
hypertension
was
higher
(P
=
0002)
in
nondippers
than
in
dippers
in
women
(relative
risk

245
to
1882)
but
not
in
men
(P
=

Our
findings
suggest
that
ambulatory
blood
pressures
stratifies
cardiovascular
risk
in
essential
hypertension
independent
of
clinic
blood
pressure
and
other
traditional
risk
markers
including
echocardiographic
left
ventricular
hypertrophy(ABSTRACT
