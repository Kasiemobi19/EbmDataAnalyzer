Identification
and

outcomes
of
undiagnosed
low

in
postmenopausal
women
results

Abstract
Text
Large
segments
of
the
population
at
risk
for
osteoporosis
and
fracture
have
not
been
evaluated
and
the
usefulness
of
peripheral
measurements
for
short-term
prediction
of
fracture
risk
is
uncertain
To
describe
the
occurrence
of
low
bone
mineral
density
(BMD)
in
postmenopausal
women
its
risk
factors
and
fracture
incidence
during
short-term
follow-up
The
National
Osteoporosis
Risk
Assessment
a
longitudinal
observational
study
initiated
September
1997
to
March
1999
with
approximately
12
months
of
subsequent
follow-up
A
total
of
200
160
ambulatory
postmenopausal
women
aged
50
years
or
older
with
no
previous
osteoporosis
diagnosis
derived
from
4236
primary
care
practices
in
34
states
Baseline
BMD
T
scores
obtained
from
peripheral
bone
densitometry
performed
at
the
heel
finger
or
forearm
risk
factors
for
low
BMD
derived
from
questionnaire
responses
and
clinical
fracture
rates
at
12-month
follow-up
Using
World
Health
Organization
criteria
396%
had
osteopenia
(T
score
of
-1
to
-249)
and
72%
had
osteoporosis
(T
score
</=-25)
Age
personal
or
family
history
of
fracture
Asian
or
Hispanic
heritage
smoking
and
cortisone
use
were
associated
with
significantly
increased
likelihood
of
osteoporosis
higher
body
mass
index
African
American
heritage
estrogen
or
diuretic
use
exercise
and
alcohol
consumption
significantly
decreased
the
likelihood
Among
the
163
979
participants
with
follow-up
information
osteoporosis
was
associated
with
a
fracture
rate
approximately
4
times
that
of
normal
BMD
(rate
ratio
403
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
359-453)
and
osteopenia
was
associated
with
a
18-fold
higher
rate
(95%
CI
149-218)
Almost
half
of
this
population
had
previously
undetected
low
BMD
including
7%
with
osteoporosis
Peripheral
BMD
results
were
highly
predictive
of
fracture
risk
Given
the
economic
and
social
costs
of
osteoporotic
fractures
strategies
to
identify
and
manage
osteoporosis
in
the
primary
care
setting
need
to
be
established
and
implemented
