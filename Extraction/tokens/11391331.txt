Antibiotics
for

urinary

infection
in
children
A

Abstract
Text
The
objective
was
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
low-dose
long-term
antibiotics
for
the
prevention
of
symptomatic
urinary
tract
infection
(UTI)
in
children
This
was
a
systematic
review
of
randomized
controlled
trials
with
a
random
effects
model
meta-analysis
Five
trials
involving
463
children
were
performed
Three
trials
(n
=
392)
evaluated
the
effectiveness
of
long
treatment
courses
of
antibiotics
(2
to
6
months)
for
children
with
acute
UTI
to
prevent
subsequent
off-treatment
infection
Only
2
trials
(n
=
71)
evaluated
the
effectiveness
of
long-term
low-dose
antibiotics
to
prevent
on-treatment
UTI
Very
few
of
the
children
enrolled
in
the
trials
were
boys
had
abnormal
renal
tracts
or
were
infants
The
trial
quality
was
poor
with
a
lack
of
blinding
and
unstated
UTI
definitions
were
almost
universal
Long-term
antibiotic
administration
reduced
the
risk
of
UTI
with
treatment
(relative
risk
031
95%
confidence
limits
010
to
100)
but
there
was
significant
heterogeneity
(Q
=
1345
P
<01)
and
there
was
no
sustained
benefit
once
antibiotics
had
ceased
(relative
risk
079
061
to
102)
Methodologic
and
applicability
problems
with
published
trials
mean
that
there
is
considerable
uncertainty
about
whether
long-term
low-dose
antibiotic
administration
prevents
UTI
in
children
Well-designed
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
are
still
required
to
evaluate
this
commonly
used
intervention
