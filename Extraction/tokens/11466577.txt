Title
The
Swedish
Obese
Subjects
(SOS)
study--rationale
and
results
Abstract
Text
Obesity
is
associated
with
increased
morbidity
and
mortality
Several
observational
epidemiological
studies
have
indicated
that
weight
gain
and
weight
loss
even
in
the
obese
is
also
related
to
an
increased
mortality
The
Swedish
Obese
Subjects
(SOS)
study
was
initiated
in
1987
as
an
attempt
to
elucidate
this
paradox
Two
thousand
matched
patient
pairs
will
be
followed
for
10
y
each
One
pair
member
is
surgically
treated
while
the
other
receives
conventional
obesity
treatment
By
February
2000
1879
patient
pairs
have
been
recruited
The
two-y
weight
reduction
was
28+/-15
kg
among
the
operated
patients
and
05+/-89
kg
among
the
obese
controls
After
eight
years
the
weight
loss
was
20+/-16
kg
in
the
surgical
group
while
the
controls
had
gained
07+/-12
kg
Weight
reductions
achieved
in
the
surgical
group
reduced
the
two-y
incidence
of
diabetes
32
times
as
compared
to
the
controls
After
eight
years
there
was
still
a
5-fold
reduction
in
diabetes
incidence
The
two-y
incidence
of
hypertension
was
similarly
reduced
26
times
in
the
surgical
group
After
eight
years
the
incidence
of
hypertension
was
almost
equal
in
the
two
study
groups
Compared
to
weight
stability
large
intentional
weight
loss
results
in
substantial
reductions
in
the
two-y
incidence
of
several
cardiovascular
risk
factors
After
eight
years
there
is
still
a
reduced
risk
of
developing
diabetes
in
the
surgical
group
while
the
incidence
of
hypertension
is
equal
in
the
two
treatment
groups
Whether
intentional
weight
loss
will
reduce
mortality
is
still
too
early
to
tell
