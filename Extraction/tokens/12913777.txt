Clinical
evaluation
of
a
quantitative

reaction
assay
for
diagnosis
of
primary
Epstein-Barr
virus
infection
in
children
Abstract
Text
Epstein-Barr
virus
(EBV)
infectious
mononucleosis
is
often
diagnosed
based
on
characteristic
clinical
features
and
either
a
positive
heterophil
antibody
test
or
serology
both
of
which
can
be
unreliable
in
young
children
Real
time
quantitative
PCR
assays
that
measure
EBV
DNA
load
in
serum
or
plasma
are
highly
sensitive
in
young
children
but
serum
and
plasma
contain
inhibitors
of
PCR
which
must
be
removed
by
DNA
extraction
techniques
A
real
time
TaqMan
PCR
assay
was
designed
and
evaluated
for
simultaneously
measuring
EBV
DNA
load
and
validating
the
removal
of
PCR
inhibitors
from
serum
samples
A
serum
sample
was
available
from
patients
classified
serologically
as
primary
EBV
infection
(n
=
28)
EBV-seronegative
(n
=
25)
and
EBV-seropositive
(n
=
26)
Patients
were
classified
as
having
EBV
infectious
mononucleosis
if
they
had
specified
clinical
findings
and
>
or
=10%
atypical
lymphocytes
in
peripheral
blood
or
had
a
positive
Monospot
test
result
DNA
was
purified
by
a
spin
column
method
and
tested
in
PCR
reactions
with
primers
for
EBV
DNA
polymerase
gene
and
internal
control
targets
Amplification
of
the
two
PCR
products
was
measured
in
real
time
with
separate
TaqMan
DNA
probes
labeled
with
various
fluorescent
reporters
The
mean
age
of
study
patients
was
9
years
4
months
Twenty-one
(75%)
of
the
patients
in
the
primary
EBV
infection
group
one
(4%)
of
the
seronegatives
and
none
of
the
seropositives
had
detectable
EBV
DNA
Within
the
primary
infection
group
those
with
detectable
virus
were
more
likely
than
those
without
detectable
virus
to
have
evidence
of
lymphadenopathy

Ten
patients
all
in
the
primary
infection
group
had
EBV
infectious
mononucleosis
and
all
had
positive
PCR
results
No
sample
contained
PCR
inhibitors
A
real
time
TaqMan
PCR
assay
allows
rapid
identification
of
patients
with
primary
EBV
infection
and
those
with
EBV
infectious
mononucleosis
