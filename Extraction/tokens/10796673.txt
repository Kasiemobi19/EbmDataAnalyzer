Title
Nasal
decongestants
for
the
common
cold
Abstract
Text
The
common
cold
is
a
major
and
recurrent
cause
of
morbidity
affecting
children
and
adults
two
or
more
times
each
year
Nasal
congestion
is
its
commonest
symptom
and
many
therapies
are
marketed
for
its
relief
There
is
no
meta-analysis
of
controlled
clinical
trials
on
the
effects
of
nasal
decongestants
for
the
common
cold
To
assess
the
efficacy
of
nasal
decongestants
at
reducing
the
symptom
of
nasal
congestion
in
adults
and
children
with
the
common
cold
and
to
identify
possible
adverse
effects
associated
with
their
use
MEDLINE
EMBASE
and
Current
Contents
were
searched
up
to
May
1999
Searching
the
Cochrane
Acute
Respiratory
Infections
Group's
trials
register
following
the
review
citation
trail
from
other
references
and
contacting
known
principal
investigators
and
pharmaceutical
companies
was
also
done
Randomised
placebo
controlled
trials
of
single-active
oral
and
topical
nasal
decongestants
in
adults
and
children
suffering
from
the
common
cold
Data
were
independently
extracted
by
two
reviewers
(DT
and
LB)
All
outcomes
variables
were
continuous
Subjective
outcomes
were
normalised
to
a
common
scale
and
a
weighted
mean
difference
(WMD)
was
calculated
A
standardised
mean
difference
(SMD)
was
calculated
for
the
objective
outcomes
Four
studies
in
adults
but
none
in
children
fitted
all
inclusion
criteria
There
was
a
significant
13%
decrease
in
subjective
symptoms
after
decongestant
compared
with
placebo
This
was
supported
by
a
significant
decrease
in
nasal
airways
resistance
Repeated
doses
of
nasal
decongestant
were
not
significantly
better
than
placebo
at
relieving
symptoms
of
nasal
congestion
A
single
dose
of
nasal
decongestant
in
the
common
cold
is
moderately
effective
for
the
short
term
relief
of
congestion
in
adults
while
there
is
no
evidence
available
to
show
benefit
after
repeated
use
over
several
days
These
medications
are
not
recommended
for
use
in
young
children
with
the
common
cold
