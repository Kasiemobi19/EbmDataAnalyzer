Thrush
in
the
breastfeeding
dyad
results
of
a
survey
on
diagnosis
and
treatment
Abstract
Text
Infection
with
Candida
albicans
in
the
breastfeeding
dyad
has
been
associated
with
extreme
pain
in
the
breastfeeding
mother
and
may
lead
to
premature
weaning
There
is
presently
a
dearth
of
information
on
diagnosis
natural
history
and
treatment
of
this
condition
in
the
literature
Therefore
before
such
a
trial
was
conducted
a
survey
was
sent
to
experts
in
the
field
of
lactation
the
members
of
The
Academy
of
Breastfeeding
Medicine
on
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
thrush
in
the
breastfeeding
mother
and
baby
Results
showed
that
the
majority
of
respondents
relied
primarily
on
history
and
physical
examination
of
the
baby
but
not
the
mother
to
make
the
diagnosis
Laboratory
tests
were
ordered
only
rarely
The
most
common
initial
treatment
was
oral
nystatin
for
the
infant
and
cream
for
the
mother's
breasts
This
was
followed
by
oral
nystatin
for
the
infant
and
oral
fluconazole
for
the
mother
Treatment
of
recurrence
or
persistence
was
again
most
commonly
nystatin
for
both
mother
and
infant
followed
by
oral
nystatin
for
the
infant
and
oral
fluconazole
for
the
mother
or
oral
fluconazole
for
both
In
the
absence
of
controlled
trials
of
this
condition
these
results
may
serve
as
suggestions
for
the
clinician
until
definitive
data
are
available
