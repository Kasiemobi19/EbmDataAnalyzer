Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
electrocardiogram
(ECG)
and
the
echocardiogram
for
demonstration
of
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
(LVH)
and
the
prognostic
values
of
these
methods

Using

of
a

action
in
Medline
(1962-January
1996)
a
study
was
made
of
the
differences
between
determination
of
LVH
by
ECG
and
by
echocardiography
with
regard
to
the
sensitivities
and
specificities
for
measuring
anatomical
LVH
and
their
predictive
values
concerning
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
The
sensitivity
of
echocardiography
for
the
prediction
of
anatomical
LVH
(88-93%)
exceeded
that
of
ECG
(21-54%)
while
both
methods
had
a
high
specificity
(77-97%)
ECG-LVH
seemed
a
better
predictor
of
cardiovascular
complications
than
echo-LVH
Echocardiography
is
the
better
instrument
for
screening
for
LVH
but
ECG
should
keep
its
place
in
the
diagnostics
of
LVH
in
view
of
its
high
predictive
value
for
morbidity
and
mortality
and
its
availability
to
primary
health
care
In
regard
to
LVH
echocardiography
measures
only
morphological
disorders
while
ECG
also
detects
functional
disorders
