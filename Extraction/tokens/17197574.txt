attenuates

after
closed

Abstract
Text
Closed
soft
tissue
injury
induces
progressive
microvascular
dysfunction
and
regional
inflammation
The
authors
tested
the
hypothesis
that
adverse
trauma-induced
effects
can
be
reduced
by
local
cooling
While
superficial
cooling
reduces
swelling
pain
and
cellular
oxygen
demand
the
effects
of
cryotherapy
on
posttraumatic
microcirculation
are
incompletely
understood
Controlled
laboratory
study
After
a
standardized
closed
soft
tissue
injury
to
the
left
tibial
compartment
male
rats
were
randomly
subjected
to
percutaneous
perfusion
for
6
hours
with
09%
NaCL
(controls
room
temperature)
or
cold
NaCL
(cryotherapy
8
degrees
C)
(n
=
7
per
group)
Uninjured
rats
served
as
shams
(n
=
7)
Microcirculatory
changes
and
leukocyte
adherence
were
determined
by
intravital
microscopy
Intramuscular
pressure
was
measured
and
invasion
of
granulocytes
and
macrophages
was
assessed
by
immunohistochemistry
Edema
and
tissue
damage
was
quantified
by
gravimetry
and
decreased
desmin
staining
Closed
soft
tissue
injury
significantly
decreased
functional
capillary
density
(240
+/-
12
cm(-1))
increased
microvascular
permeability
(075
+/-
003)
endothelial
leukocyte
adherence
(995
+/-
77/cm(2))
granulocyte
(1820
+/-
255/mm(2))
and
macrophage
infiltration
edema
formation
and
myonecrosis
(ratio
295
+/-
045)
within
the
left
extensor
digitorum
longus
muscle
Cryotherapy
for
6
hours
significantly
restored
diminished
functional
capillary
density
(393
+/-
35)
markedly
decreased
elevated
intramuscular
pressure
reduced
the
number
of
adhering
(462
+/-
188/cm(2))
and
invading
granulocytes
(119
+/-
28)
and
attenuated
tissue
damage
(ratio
17
+/-
017)
The
hypothesis
that
prolonged
cooling
reduces
posttraumatic
microvascular
dysfunction
inflammation
and
structural
impairment
was
confirmed
These
results
may
have
therapeutic
implications
as
cryotherapy
after
closed
soft
tissue
injury
is
a
valuable
therapeutic
approach
to
improve
nutritive
perfusion
and
attenuate
leukocyte-mediated
tissue
destruction
The
risk
for
evolving
compartment
syndrome
may
be
reduced
thereby
preventing
further
irreversible
aggravation
