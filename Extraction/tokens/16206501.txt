Low-dose
gluten
challenge
in
celiac
sprue
malabsorptive
and
antibody
responses
Abstract
Text
Undiagnosed
patients
with
symptoms
of
celiac
sprue
often
present
to
physicians
after
establishing
dietary
gluten
exclusion
Although
they
must
resume
a
gluten-containing
diet
for
evaluation
there
are
no
guidelines
regarding
duration
of
the
gluten
challenge
gluten
dose
or
monitoring
parameters
We
investigated
the
effects
of
a
short-term
gluten
challenge
in
asymptomatic
treated
adult
celiac
patients
on
intestinal
absorption
and
celiac
antibody
tests
Eight
adult
asymptomatic
celiac
patients
consumed
either
5
or
10
g
of
partially
hydrolyzed
gluten
per
day
in
an
orange
juice
mixture
for
21
days
while
maintaining
their
usual
gluten-free
diet
A
symptom
questionnaire
serum
antibodies
(antigliadin
immunoglobulin
[Ig]A
and
antitransglutaminase
IgA
and
IgG)
D-xylose
urine
excretion
test
and
72-hour
quantitative
fecal
fat
test
were
monitored
Two
patients
(25%)
had
at
least
1
abnormal
celiac
antibody
test
at
baseline
There
was
no
increase
in
antibodies
during
gluten
exposure
compared
with
baseline
for
any
of
the
patients
(P
>
05)
At
baseline
1
patient
had
abnormal
urine
xylose
excretion
and
3
patients
had
abnormal
fecal
fat
values
At
day
15
of
gluten
challenge
all
patients
had
reduced
xylose
absorption
compared
with
baseline
(P
=
0019)
and
5
of
8
participants
(63%)
reduced
their
xylose
excretion
to
the
abnormal
range
Seven
of
8
patients
(88%)
had
increased
fecal
fat
excretion
at
day
15
(P
=
026)
and
6
of
these
(75%)
had
steatorrhea
by
day
15
Short-term
gluten
challenge
in
asymptomatic
adult
celiac
patients
produces
carbohydrate
and
fat
malabsorption
but
does
not
increase
transglutaminase
and
antigliadin
antibody
titers
