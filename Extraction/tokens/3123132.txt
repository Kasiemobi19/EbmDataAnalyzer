Effective
contraception
with
the
levonorgestrel-releasing
intrauterine
device
12-month
report
of
a
European
multicenter
study
Abstract
Text
The
use-effectiveness
of
an
intrauterine
contraceptive
device
releasing
20
mcg
of
levonorgestrel
daily
(Lng-IUD)
and
of
a
Nova
T
copper-releasing
IUD
were
studied
in
a
randomized
comparative
multicenter
trial
The
Lng-IUD
was
inserted
in
1821
and
the
Nova
T
in
937
women
The
12-month
net
pregnancy
rate
with
the
Lng-IUD
(01
per
hundred
women)
was
significantly
lower
than
that
with
the
Nova
T
(09
per
hundred)
Removal
rates
for
menstrual
problems
and/or
pain
were
similar
for
the
two
methods
(net
rates
75
and
87
respectively)
The
12-month
continuation
rates
were
822
for
the
Nova
T
and
797
for
the
Lng-IUD
The
reduction
of
the
bleeding
led
to
oligomenorrhea
and
amenorrhea
in
users
of
the
Lng-IUD
the
removal
rate
for
these
reasons
was
14
The
removal
rate
for
hormonal
side
effects
with
the
Lng-IUD
was
24
Blood
hemoglobin
concentrations
increased
among
users
of
the
Lng-IUD
and
decreased
among
users
of
the
Nova
T
The
results
show
that
the
Lng-IUD
was
a
highly
effective
contraceptive
method
which
reduced
menstrual
bleeding
It
is
a
promising
alternative
for
women
desiring
a
highly
effective
method
for
long-term
use
