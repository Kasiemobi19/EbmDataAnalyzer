Acyclovir
cream
for
treatment
of
herpes

labialis
results
of
two
randomized
double-blind
vehicle-controlled
multicenter
clinical
trials
Abstract
Text
Acyclovir
cream
has
been
available
for
the
treatment
of
herpes
labialis
in
numerous
countries
outside
the
United
States
for
over
a
decade
Evidence
for
its
efficacy
comes
from
a
few
small
clinical
trials
conducted
in
the
1980s
To
examine
more
comprehensively
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
this
formulation
we
conducted
two
independent
identical
parallel
randomized
double-blind
vehicle-controlled
large-scale
multicenter
clinical
trials
Healthy
adults
with
a
history
of
frequent
herpes
labialis
were
recruited
from
the
general
population
screened
for
eligibility
randomized
equally
to
5%
acyclovir
cream
or
vehicle
control
given
study
medication
and
told
to
self-initiate
treatment
five
times
daily
for
4
days
beginning
within
1
h
of
the
onset
of
a
recurrent
episode
The
number
of
patients
who
treated
a
lesion
was
686
in
study
1
and
699
in
study
2
In
study
1
the
mean
duration
of
episodes
was
43
days
for
patients
treated
with
acyclovir
cream
and
48
days
for
those
treated
with
the
vehicle
control
(hazards
ratio
[HR]
=
123
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
106
to
144
P
=
0007)
In
study
2
the
mean
duration
of
episodes
was
46
days
for
patients
treated
with
acyclovir
cream
and
52
days
for
those
treated
with
the
vehicle
control
(HR
=
124
95%
CI
106
to
144
P
=
0006)
Efficacy
was
apparent
whether
therapy
was
initiated
"early"
(prodrome
or
erythema
lesion
stage)
or
"late"
(papule
or
vesicle
stage)
There
was
a
statistically
significant
reduction
in
the
duration
of
lesion
pain
in
both
studies
Acyclovir
cream
did
not
prevent
the
development
of
classical
lesions
(progression
to
vesicles
ulcers
and/or
crusts)
Adverse
events
were
mild
and
infrequent
