Title
Circumcision
and
genital
dermatoses
Abstract
Text
It
is
well
recognized
that
the
presence
of
a
foreskin
predisposes
to
penile
carcinoma
and
sexually
transmitted
infections
We
have
investigated
the
relationship
between
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
foreskin
and
penile
dermatoses
To
determine
whether
there
is
an
association
between
circumcision
and
penile
dermatoses
A
retrospective
case
control
study
of
patients
attending
the
department
of
dermatology
with
genital
skin
conditions
The
study
population
consisted
of
357
male
patients
referred
for
diagnosis
and
management
of
genital
skin
disease
The
control
population
consisted
of
305
male
patients
without
genital
skin
disease
attending
the
general
dermatology
clinics
over
a
4-month
period
The
relationship
between
circumcision
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
skin
disease
involving
the
penis
was
investigated
The
rate
of
circumcision
in
the
general
male
dermatology
population
was
determined
The
most
common
diagnoses
were
psoriasis
(n
=
94)
penile
infections
(n
=
58)
lichen
sclerosus
(n
=
52)
lichen
planus
(n
=
39)
seborrheic
dermatitis
(n
=
29)
and
Zoon
balanitis
(n
=
27)
Less
common
diagnoses
included
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(n
=
4)
bowenoid
papulosis
(n
=
3)
and
Bowen
disease
(n
=
3)
The
age-adjusted
odds
ratio
for
all
penile
skin
diseases
associated
with
presence
of
the
foreskin
was
324
(95%
confidence
interval
226-464)
All
patients
with
Zoon
balanitis
bowenoid
papulosis
and
nonspecific
balanoposthitis
were
uncircumcised
Lichen
sclerosus
was
diagnosed
in
only
1
circumcised
patient
Most
patients
with
psoriasis
lichen
planus
and
seborrheic
eczema
(72%
69%
and
72%
respectively)
were
uncircumcised
at
presentation
The
majority
of
men
with
penile
infections
(84%)
were
uncircumcised
Most
cases
of
inflammatory
dermatoses
were
diagnosed
in
uncircumcised
men
suggesting
that
circumcision
protects
against
inflammatory
dermatoses
The
presence
of
the
foreskin
may
promote
inflammation
by
a
k√∂ebnerization
phenomenon
or
the
presence
of
infectious
agents
as
yet
unidentified
may
induce
inflammation
The
data
suggest
that
circumcision
prevents
or
protects
against
common
infective
penile
dermatoses
