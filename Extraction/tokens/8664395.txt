Title
Genital
anomalies
and
risk
for
testicular
cancer
in
Danish
men
Abstract
Text
In
a
cohort
of
Danish
boys
characterized
by
(1)
being
born
between
1941
and
1957
(2)
having
attended
schools
in
a
defined
area
of
Denmark
and
(3)
having
a
school
health
record
available
183
were
registered
in
the
Danish
Cancer
Registry
with
testicular
cancer
diagnosed
before
January
1
1985
We
selected
366
age-
and
sex-matched
controls
from
the
same
cohort
Using
information
recorded
by
school
physicians
we
performed
logistic
regression
analyses
to
estimate
the
relative
risks
(RR)
associated
with
various
genital
anomalies
We
found
the
risk
for
testicular
cancer
to
be
raised
for
men
with
a
history
of
cryptorchidism
[RR
=
52
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
=
21-130]
inguinal
hernia
(RR
=
18
95%
CI
=
09-37)
hypospadias
(RR
=
42
95%
CI
=
04-427)
and
hydrocele
(RR
=
24
95%
CI
=
06-90)
We
observed
no
decrease
in
the
risk
associated
with
cryptorchidism
after
correction
of
the
maldescent
in
early
childhood
The
RR
of
testicular
cancer
in
the
contralateral
normally
descended
testis
in
unilateral
cryptorchid
men
was
increased
to
36
The
results
add
to
the
growing
evidence
for
a
common
causal
factor
for
both
testicular
cancer
and
cryptorchidism
and
support
the
findings
from
other
studies
of
associations
between
other
genital
anomalies
involving
the
closure
of
the
processus
vaginalis
and
the
risk
of
testicular
cancer
