Calcium
intake
and
fracture
risk
results
from
the
study
of
osteoporotic
fractures
Abstract
Text
The
relation
between
dietary
calcium
calcium
and
vitamin
D
supplements
and
the
risk
of
fractures
of
the
hip
(n
=
332)
ankle
(n
=
210)
proximal
humerus
(n
=
241)
wrist
(n
=
467)
and
vertebrae
(n
=
389)
was
investigated
in
a
cohort
study
involving
9704
US
white
women
aged
65
years
or
older
Baseline
assessments
took
place
in
1986-1988
in
four
US
metropolitan
areas
Dietary
calcium
intake
was
assessed
at
baseline
with
a
validated
food
frequency
questionnaire
Data
on
new
nonvertebral
fractures
were
collected
every
4
months
during
a
mean
of
66
years
of
follow-up
identification
of
new
vertebral
fractures
was
based
on
comparison
of
baseline
and
follow-up
radiographs
of
the
spine
done
a
mean
of
37
years
apart
Results
were
adjusted
for
numerous
potential
confounders
including
weight
physical
activity
estrogen
use
protein
intake
and
history
of
falls
osteoporosis
and
fractures
There
were
no
important
associations
between
dietary
calcium
intake
and
the
risk
of
any
of
the
fractures
studied
Current
use
of
calcium
supplements
was
associated
with
increased
risk
of
hip
(relative
risk
=
15
95%
confidence
interval
11-20)
and
vertebral
(relative
risk
=
14
95%
confidence
interval
11-19)
fractures
current
use
of
Tums
antacid
tablets
was
associated
with
increased
risk
of
fractures
of
the
proximal
humerus
(relative
risk
=
17
95%
confidence
interval
13-24)
There
was
no
evidence
of
a
protective
effect
of
vitamin
D
supplements
Although
a
true
adverse
effect
of
calcium
supplements
on
fracture
risk
cannot
be
ruled
out
it
is
more
likely
that
our
findings
are
due
to
inadequately
controlled
confounding
by
indications
for
use
of
supplements
In
conclusion
this
study
did
not
find
a
substantial
beneficial
effect
of
calcium
on
fracture
risk
