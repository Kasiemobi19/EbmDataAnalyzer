What
is
the
long
term
outcome
for
children
who
fail

A
systematic
review
Abstract
Text
To
ascertain
the
long
term
outcomes
in
children
diagnosed
as
having
failure
to
thrive
(FTT)
Systematic
review
of
cohort
studies
Medline
Psychinfo
Embase
Cinahl
Web
of
Science
Cochrane
and
DARE
databases
were
searched
for
potentially
relevant
studies
Inclusion
criteria
cohort
studies
or
randomised
controlled
trials
in
children
<2
years
old
with
failure
to
thrive
defined
as
weight
<10th
centile
or
lower
centile
and/or
weight
velocity
<10th
centile
with
growth
development
or
behaviour
measured
at
3
years
of
age
or
older
Thirteen
studies
met
the
inclusion
criteria
eight
included
a
comparison
group
of
which
five
included
children
identified
in
community
settings
Two
were
randomised
controlled
trials
Attrition
rates
were
10-30%
Data
from
population
based
studies
with
comparison
groups
and
which
reported
comparable
outcomes
in
an
appropriate
form
were
pooled
in
a
random
effects
meta-analysis
Four
studies
report
IQ
scores
at
follow
up
and
the
pooled
standardised
mean
difference
was
-022
(95%
CI
-041
to
-003)
Two
studies
reported
growth
data
as
standard
deviation
scores
Their
pooled
weighted
mean
difference
for
weight
was
-124
SDS
(95%
CI
-200
to
-048)
and
for
height
-087
SDS
(95%
CI
-147
to
-028)
No
studies
corrected
for
parental
height
but
two
reported
that
parents
of
index
children
were
shorter
The
IQ
difference
(equivalent
to
approximately
3
IQ
points)
is
of
questionable
clinical
significance
The
height
and
weight
differences
are
larger
but
few
children
were
below
the
3rd
centile
at
follow
up
It
is
unclear
to
what
extent
observed
differences
reflect
causal
relations
or
confounding
due
to
other
variables
In
the
light
of
these
results
the
aggressive
approach
to
identification
and
management
of
failure
to
thrive
needs
reassessing
