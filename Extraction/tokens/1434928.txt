Spontaneous
rupture
of
the
spleen
due
to
infectious
mononucleosis
Abstract
Text
Spontaneous
splenic
rupture
is
an
extremely
rare
but
life-threatening
complication
of
infectious
mononucleosis
in
young
adults
Although
splenectomy
remains
effective
treatment
reports
of
successful
nonoperative
management
have
challenged
the
time-honored
approach
of
emergent
laparotomy
On
retrospective
analysis
of
our
institutional
experience
with
8116
patients
who
had
this
disease
during
a
40-year
period
we
found
5
substantiated
cases
of
atraumatic
splenic
rupture
due
to
infectious
mononucleosis
Four
additional
cases
of
suspected
splenic
rupture
were
noted
All
nine
patients
were
hospitalized
and
treated
(seven
underwent
splenectomy
and
two
were
treated
with
supportive
measures
only)
and
they
remain
alive
and
well
In
patients
with
infectious
mononucleosis
suspected
of
having
rupture
of
the
spleen
a
rapid
but
thorough
assessment
and
prompt
implementation
of
appropriate
management
should
minimize
the
associated
morbidity
and
mortality
On
the
basis
of
review
of
the
medical
literature
and
careful
scrutiny
of
our
own
experience
we
advocate
emergent
splenectomy
for
spontaneous
splenic
rupture
in
patients
with
infectious
mononucleosis
