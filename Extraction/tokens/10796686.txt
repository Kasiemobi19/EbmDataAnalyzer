Abstract
Text
Efforts
to
assist
patients
with
adherence
to
prescribed
self-administered
medications
might
improve
the
benefits
and
efficiency
of
health
care
To
update
an
ongoing
review
summarising
the
results
of
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
of
interventions
to
help
patients
follow
prescriptions
for
medications
focusing
on
trials
that
measured
both
adherence
and
clinical
outcomes

bibliographies
in

adherence
articles
in
the
reviewers'
personal
collections
and
contact
with
authors
Articles
were
selected
if
they
reported
an
unconfounded
RCT
of
an
intervention
to
improve
adherence
with
prescribed
medications
measuring
both
medication
adherence
and
treatment
outcome
with
at
least
80%
follow-up
of
each
group
studied
and
for
long-term
treatments
at
least
six
months
follow-up
for
studies
with
positive
initial
findings
Information
on
study
design
features
interventions
and
controls
and
findings
were
extracted
by
one
reviewer
(PM)
and
a
research
assistant
and
confirmed
by
two
of
the
other
reviewers
The
studies
were
too
disparate
to
warrant
meta-analysis
For
short-term
treatments
one
study
of
counselling
and
written
information
showed
an
effect
on
adherence
and
clinical
outcome
Ten
of
19
interventions
for
long-term
treatments
reported
in
17
RCTs
were
associated
with
improvements
in
adherence
but
only
nine
interventions
led
to
improvements
in
treatment
outcomes
Almost
all
of
the
interventions
that
were
effective
for
long-term
care
were
complex
including
combinations
of
more
convenient
care
information
counselling
reminders
self-monitoring
reinforcement
family
therapy
and
other
forms
of
additional
supervision
or
attention
Even
the
most
effective
interventions
did
not
lead
to
large
improvements
in
adherence
and
treatment
outcomes
Two
studies
showed
that
telling
patients
about
adverse
effects
of
treatment
did
not
affect
their
adherence
The
full
benefits
of
medications
cannot
be
realised
at
currently
achievable
levels
of
adherence
Current
methods
of
improving
adherence
for
chronic
health
problems
are
mostly
complex
and
not
very
effective
More
studies
of
innovative
approaches
to
assist
patients
to
follow
medication
prescriptions
are
needed
