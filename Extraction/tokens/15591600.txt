Literature
and
data
related
to
the
aspects
of
childhood
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
Relevant
information
and
data
were
reviewed
by
the
authors
There
is
a
paucity
of
normal
data
on
childhood
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
Varying
definitions
and
diagnostic
criteria
have
been
used
in
different
studies
making
direct
comparison
difficult
However
a
small-scale
local
study
found
that
the
prevalence
and
clinical
features
of
this
condition
were
similar
to
data
published
overseas
Increasing
evidence
suggests
that
childhood
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
is
associated
with
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
neurocognitive
dysfunction
Overnight
polysomnography
has
remained
the
gold
standard
for
diagnosing
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
but
the
diagnostic
criteria
has
not
been
standardised
nor
correlated
with
the
long-term
outcome
Surgical
intervention
has
remained
the
treatment
of
choice
although
alternative
therapies
are
being
evaluated
Consensus
on
the
various
important
aspects
of
childhood
obstructive
sleep
apnoea
is
still
limited
especially
the
definition
diagnosis
and
long-term
sequelae
of
this
condition
Further
advances
can
only
be
made
with
international
collaborative
research
using
evidence-based
definitions
standardised
techniques
and
polysomnographic
criteria
