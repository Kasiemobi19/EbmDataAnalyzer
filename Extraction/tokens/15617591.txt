Spinal
cord
stimulation
versus
repeated
lumbosacral
spine
surgery
for
chronic
pain
a
randomized
controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Persistent
or
recurrent
radicular
pain
after
lumbosacral
spine
surgery
is
often
associated
with
nerve
root
compression
and
is
treated
by
repeated
operation
or
as
a
last
resort
by
spinal
cord
stimulation
(SCS)
We
conducted
a
prospective
randomized
controlled
trial
to
test
our
hypothesis
that
SCS
is
more
likely
than
reoperation
to
result
in
a
successful
outcome
by
standard
measures
of
pain
relief
and
treatment
outcome
including
subsequent
use
of
health
care
resources
For
an
average
of
3
years
postoperatively
disinterested
third-party
interviewers
followed
50
patients
selected
for
reoperation
by
standard
criteria
and
randomized
to
SCS
or
reoperation
If
the
results
of
the
randomized
treatment
were
unsatisfactory
patients
could
cross
over
to
the
alternative
Success
was
based
on
self-reported
pain
relief
and
patient
satisfaction
Crossover
to
the
alternative
procedure
was
an
outcome
measure
Use
of
analgesics
activities
of
daily
living
and
work
status
were
self-reported
Among
45
patients
(90%)
available
for
follow-up
SCS
was
more
successful
than
reoperation
(9
of
19
patients
versus
3
of
26
patients
P
<001)
Patients
initially
randomized
to
SCS
were
significantly
less
likely
to
cross
over
than
were
those
randomized
to
reoperation
(5
of
24
patients
versus
14
of
26
patients
P=002)
Patients
randomized
to
reoperation
required
increased
opiate
analgesics
significantly
more
often
than
those
randomized
to
SCS
(P
<0025)
Other
measures
of
activities
of
daily
living
and
work
status
did
not
differ
significantly
SCS
is
more
effective
than
reoperation
as
a
treatment
for
persistent
radicular
pain
after
lumbosacral
spine
surgery
and
in
the
great
majority
of
patients
it
obviates
the
need
for
reoperation
