Title
Isoniazid
toxicity
in
health
care
workers
Abstract
Text
The
toxicity
of
isoniazid
chemoprophylaxis
was
assessed
in
83
health
care
workers
(HCWs)
receiving
a
6-month
course
in
whom
clinical
toxicity
and
liver
function
were
monitored
Thirty-four
HCWs
(41%)
developed
an
adverse
event
in
26
(76%)
toxicity
was
sufficiently
severe
to
require
cessation
of
treatment
Of
the
total
liver
function
test
abnormalities
(serum
alanine
transaminase
levels
more
than
two
times
normal)
were
evident
in
14
subjects
with
8
requiring
cessation
of
therapy
Other
symptoms
reported
included
malaise
nausea
with
associated
anorexia
arthralgia
and
rash
Mean
time
to
development
of
symptoms
was
3
weeks
(range
05-6
weeks)
with
the
mean
age
of
those
with
toxicity
not
differing
significantly
from
those
without
(38
vs
39
years)
The
high
rate
of
toxicity
seen
in
this
study
is
sufficiently
notable
that
we
advocate
the
use
of
monthly
liver
function
testing
and
frequent
review
in
those
receiving
isoniazid
prophylactic
therapy
