Title
Prognostic
value
of
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
in
treated
hypertensive
men
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
cardiovascular
risk
in
hypertensive
subjects
according
to
systolic
blood
pressure
(SBP)
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
(DBP)
levels
The
study
sample
consisted
of
4714
hypertensive
men
treated
by
their
physician
who
had
a
standard
health
checkup
at
the
d'Investigations
PrÃ©ventives
et
Cliniques
Center
Paris
France
between
1972
and
1988
Cardiovascular
disease
(CVD)
and
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
mortality
were
assessed
for
a
mean
period
of
14
years
Among
treated
subjects
855%
presented
uncontrolled
values
for
SBP
(>
or
=
40
mm
Hg)
and/or
DBP
(>
or
=
90
mm
Hg)
After
adjustment
for
age
and
associated
risk
factors
these
subjects
presented
an
increased
risk
for
CVD
mortality
(risk
ratio
[RR]
166
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
104-264)
and
for
CHD
mortality
(RR
235
95%
CI
103-535)
compared
with
controlled
subjects
After
adjustment
for
age
associated
risk
factors
and
DBP
and
compared
with
subjects
with
SBP
under
140
mm
Hg
the
RR
for
CVD
mortality
was
181
(95%
CI
104-313)
in
subjects
with
SBP
between
140
and
160
mm
Hg
and
194
(95%
CI
110-343)
in
subjects
with
SBP
over
160
mm
Hg
By
contrast
after
adjustment
for
SBP
levels
CVD
risk
was
not
associated
with
DBP
Compared
with
subjects
with
DBP
under
90
mm
Hg
RR
for
CVD
mortality
was
117
(95%
CI
080-170)
in
subjects
with
DBP
between
90
and
99
mm
Hg
and
103
(95%
CI
067-156)
in
subjects
with
DBP
over
100
mm
Hg
Similar
results
were
observed
for
CHD
mortality
In
hypertensive
men
treated
in
clinical
practice
SBP
is
a
good
predictor
of
CVD
and
CHD
risk
Diastolic
blood
pressure
which
remains
the
main
criterion
used
by
most
physicians
to
determine
drug
efficacy
appears
to
be
of
little
value
in
determining
cardiovascular
risk
Evaluation
of
risk
in
treated
individuals
should
take
SBP
rather
than
DBP
values
into
account
