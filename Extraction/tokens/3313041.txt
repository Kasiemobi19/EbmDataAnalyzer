Abstract
Text
In
a
randomized
double-blind
five-year
trial
we
tested
the
efficacy
of
simultaneously
elevating
serum
levels
of
high-density
lipoprotein
(HDL)
cholesterol
and
lowering
levels
of
non-HDL
cholesterol
with
gemfibrozil
in
reducing
the
risk
of
coronary
heart
disease
in
4081
asymptomatic
middle-aged
men
(40
to
55
years
of
age)
with
primary
dyslipidemia
(non-HDL
cholesterol
greater
than
or
equal
to
200
mg
per
deciliter
[52
mmol
per
liter]
in
two
consecutive
pretreatment
measurements)
One
group
(2051
men)
received
600
mg
of
gemfibrozil
twice
daily
and
the
other
(2030
men)
received
placebo
Gemfibrozil
caused
a
marked
increase
in
HDL
cholesterol
and
persistent
reductions
in
serum
levels
of
total
low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)
and
non-HDL
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
There
were
minimal
changes
in
serum
lipid
levels
in
the
placebo
group
The
cumulative
rate
of
cardiac
end
points
at
five
years
was
273
per
1000
in
the
gemfibrozil
group
and
414
per
1000
in
the
placebo
group--a
reduction
of
340
percent
in
the
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
(95
percent
confidence
interval
82
to
526
P
less
than
002
two-tailed
test)
The
decline
in
incidence
in
the
gemfibrozil
group
became
evident
in
the
second
year
and
continued
throughout
the
study
There
was
no
difference
between
the
groups
in
the
total
death
rate
nor
did
the
treatment
influence
the
cancer
rates
The
results
are
in
accord
with
two
previous
trials
with
different
pharmacologic
agents
and
indicate
that
modification
of
lipoprotein
levels
with
gemfibrozil
reduces
the
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
in
men
with
dyslipidemia
