Behavior
problems
and
group-based
parent
education
programs
Abstract
Text
Behavior
problems
in
children
are
an
important
social
educational
and
health
issue
The
prevalence
of
these
problems
their
stability
over
time
their
poor
prognosis
and
their
costs
to
both
individuals
and
the
society
all
point
to
the
need
for
primary
prevention
and
early
effective
interventions
A
systematic
review
examined
the
effectiveness
of
group
parent
education
programs
that
aimed
to
improve
behavior
problems
in
3-
to
10-year-old
children
The
phrase
"parent
education
program"
is
used
here
to
refer
to
group-based
programs
with
a
standardized
format
aimed
at
enhancing
parenting
skills
The
term
"behavior
problems"
is
used
to
refer
to
children
exhibiting
externalizing
problems
such
as
temper
tantrums
aggression
and
noncompliance
It
does
not
include
children
diagnosed
as
having
attention-deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
This
review
focused
explicitly
on
measures
of
child
behavioral
outcomes
which
are
only
small
albeit
important
outcomes
of
parent
education
programs
Reviews
focusing
on
other
clinically
relevant
outcomes
are
also
needed
including
parental
well-being
and
attitudes
towards
parenting
Other
reviews
are
also
needed
to
collate
evidence
concerning
the
effectiveness
of
parent
education
programs
with
other
age-groups
ie
preschoolers
and
adolescents
and
in
improving
other
aspects
of
child
well-being
The
review
included
published
studies
only
and
as
such
may
have
been
influenced
by
a
"publication
bias"
Inclusion
criteria
comprised
the
use
of
a
waiting
list
a
no-treatment
or
placebo
control
group
and
at
least
one
standardized
measure
assessing
the
child's
behavior
Only
studies
published
after
1970
that
included
at
least
one
"group-based"
parent
education
program
were
included
A
total
of
255
primary
studies
were
identified
but
only
16
of
these
and
2
follow-up
studies
met
all
of
the
specified
inclusion
criteria
Critical
appraisal
of
these
16
studies
revealed
considerable
heterogeneity
in
the
interventions
the
populations
studied
and
the
outcome
measures
used
Nevertheless
these
studies
suggest
that
structured
parent
education
programs
can
be
effective
in
producing
positive
change
in
both
parental
perceptions
and
objective
measures
of
children's
behavior
and
that
these
changes
are
maintained
over
time
Because
of
the
small
number
of
controlled
studies
and
their
methodological
variations
caution
should
be
exercised
before
these
findings
are
generalized
broadly
