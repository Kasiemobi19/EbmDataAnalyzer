Title
Immunotherapy
for
recurrent
miscarriage
Abstract
Text
Immunologic
aberrations
might
be
the
cause
of
recurrent
early
pregnancy
loss
in
some
women
The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
leukocyte
immunisation
or
other
immunologic
treatments
such
as
intravenous
immune
globulin
(IVIG)
on
the
live
birth
rate
in
women
with
previous
unexplained
recurrent
miscarriages
The
Cochrane
Pregnancy
and
Childbirth
Group
trials
register
was
searched
(September
2002)
Individual
patient
data
were
obtained
from
the
American
Society
for
Reproductive
Immunology
Randomised
trials
of
immunotherapy
in
women
with
three
or
more
prior
miscarriages
and
no
more
than
one
live
birth
all
recognised
non-immunologic
causes
ruled
out
and
no
simultaneous
treatment
intervention
Eligibility
and
trial
quality
were
assessed
by
one
reviewer
Nineteen
trials
of
high
quality
were
included
The
various
forms
of
immunotherapy
did
not
show
significant
differences
between
treatment
and
control
groups
in
terms
of
subsequent

births
