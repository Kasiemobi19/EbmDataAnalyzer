Abstract
Text
The
most
suitable
antihypertensive
drug
to
reduce
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
in
patients
with
hypertension
and
diabetes
is
unclear
In
prespecified
analyses
we
compared
the
effects
of
losartan
and
atenolol
on
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
in
diabetic
patients
As
part
of
the
LIFE
study
in
a
double-masked
randomised
parallel-group
trial
we
assigned
a
group
of
1195
patients
with
diabetes
hypertension
and
signs
of
left-ventricular
hypertrophy
(LVH)
on
electrocardiograms
losartan-based
or
atenolol-based
treatment
Mean
age
of
patients
was
67
years
(SD
7)
and
mean
blood
pressure
177/96
mm
Hg
(14/10)
after
placebo
run-in
We
followed
up
patients
for
at
least
4
years
(mean
47
years
[11])
We
used
Cox
regression
analysis
with
baseline
Framingham
risk
score
and
electrocardiogram-LVH
as
covariates
to
compare
the
effects
of
the
drugs
on
the
primary
composite
endpoint
of
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
(cardiovascular
death
stroke
or
myocardial
infarction)
Mean
blood
pressure
fell
to
146/79
mm
Hg
(17/11)
in
losartan
patients
and
148/79
mm
Hg
(19/11)
in
atenolol
patients
The
primary
endpoint
occurred
in
103
patients
assigned
losartan
(n=586)
and
139
assigned
atenolol
(n=609)
relative

38
and
61
patients
in
the
losartan
and
atenolol
groups
respectively
died
from
cardiovascular
disease
063
(042-095)
p=0028
Mortality
from
all
causes
was
63
and
104
in
losartan
and
atenolol
groups
respectively
061
(045-084)
p=0002
Losartan
was
more
effective
than
atenolol
in
reducing
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
as
well
as
mortality
from
all
causes
in
patients
with
hypertension
diabetes
and
LVH
Losartan
seems
to
have
benefits
beyond
blood
pressure
reduction
