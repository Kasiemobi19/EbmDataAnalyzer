Title
Muscle
enzyme
release
does
not
predict
muscle
function
impairment
after
triathlon
Abstract
Text
We
sought
to
determine
the
effects
of
a
long
distance
triathlon
(4
km
swim
120
km
bike-ride
and
30
km
run)
on
the
four-day
kinetics
of
the
biochemical
markers
of
muscle
damage
and
whether
they
were
quantitatively
linked
with
muscle
function
impairment
and
soreness
Experimental
design
Data
were
collected
from
2
days
before
until
4
days
after
the
completion
of
the
race
Participants
Twelve
triathletes
performed
the
triathlon
and
five
did
not
Measures
Maximal
voluntary
contraction
(MVC)
muscle
soreness
(DOMS)
and
total
serum
CK
CK-MB
LDH
AST
and
ALT
activities
were
assessed
Significant
changes
after
triathlon
completion
were
found
for
all
muscle
damage
indirect
markers
over
time
(p
<
00001)
MVC
of
the
knee
extensor
and
flexor
muscles
decreased
over
time
(p
<
005)
There
is
disparity
in
the
time
point
at
which
peak
values
where
reached
for
DOMS
MVC
and
enzyme
leakage
There
is
no
correlation
between
serum
enzyme
leakage
DOMS
and
MVC
impairment
which
occur
after
triathlon
Long
distance
triathlon
race
caused
muscle
damage
but
extent
as
well
as
muscle
recovery
cannot
be
evaluated
by
the
magnitude
of
changes
in
serum
enzyme
activities
Muscle
enzyme
release
cannot
be
used
to
predict
the
magnitude
of
the
muscle
function
impairment
caused
by
muscle
damage
