Title
Tracking
of
childhood
overweight
into
adulthood
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
Abstract
Text
Overweight
and
obesity
in
youth
are
important
public
health
concerns
and
are
of
particular
interest
because
of
possible
long-term
associations
with
adult
weight
status
and
morbidity
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
systematically
review
the
literature
and
update
evidence
concerning
persistence
of
childhood
overweight
A
computerized
bibliographical
search--restricted
to
studies
with
a
prospective
or
retrospective
longitudinal
design--was
conducted
Two
authors
independently
extracted
data
and
assessed
the
methodological
quality
of
the
included
studies
in
four
dimensions
(i)
study
population
and
participation
rate
(ii)
study
attrition
(iii)
data
collection
and
(iv)
data
analysis
Conclusions
were
based
on
a
rating
system
of
three
levels
of
evidence
A
total
of
25
publications
were
selected
for
inclusion
in
this
review
According
to
a
methodological
quality
assessment
13
studies
were
considered
to
be
of
high
quality
The
majority
of
these
high-quality
studies
were
published
after
2001
indicating
that
recently
published
data
in
particular
provide
us
with
reliable
information
All
included
studies
consistently
report
an
increased
risk
of
overweight
and
obese
youth
becoming
overweight
adults
suggesting
that
the
likelihood
of
persistence
of
overweight
into
adulthood
is
moderate
for
overweight
and
obese
youth
However
predictive
values
varied
considerably
Limiting
aspects
with
respect
to
generalizability
and
methodological
issues
are
discussed
