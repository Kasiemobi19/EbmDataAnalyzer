The
relationship
of
blood
glucose
and
haemoglobin
A1
levels
in
diabetic
subjects
Abstract
Text
Recommendations
exist
that
fasting
plasma
glucose
(FPG)
levels
can
be
substituted
for
glycosylated
haemoglobin
A1
(HbA1)
in
Type
II
diabetic
subjects
(DM
II)
which
have
potential
important
financial
implications
The
present
study
was
designed
to
expand
this
examination
and
to
include
Type
I
DM
(DMI)
patients
and
random
blood
glucose
(RBG)
values
Data
were
obtained
from
234
DM
II
and
104
DM
I
patients
over
3
years
Correlation
of
HbA1
with
FPG
levels
in
DM
II
yielded
an
r
value
of
061
Correlation
of
HbA1
with
RBG
and
2
h
post
prandial
glucose
measurements
yielded
r
values
of
059
and
051
respectively
p
<
0001
In
DM
I
similar
correlations
gave
r
values
ranging
between
027
and
038
p
<
001-0001
Thus
while
significant
correlations
exist
between
HbA1
and
FPG
and
RBG
measurements
in
both
DM
I
and
DM
II
clinically
applicable
information
on
long-term
diabetic
control
can
only
be
achieved
from
glucose
measurements
in
DM
II
but
the
correlation
is
not
sufficiently
tight
to
recommend
substitution
of
plasma
glucose
for
HbA1
determinations
despite
the
cost
advantages
