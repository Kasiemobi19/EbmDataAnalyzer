Is
this

perimenopausal
Abstract
Text
Perimenopause
is
a
time
of
transition
for
women
at
midlife
Women
want
to
know
whether
they
are
starting
this
change
and
physicians
need
to
know
the
accuracy
of
a
clinical
examination
in
identifying
perimenopausal
women
These
women
should
be
counseled
about
alleviating
climacteric
symptoms
using
contraception
and
preventing
diseases
such
as
osteoporosis
To
systematically
review
the
accuracy
of
self-assessment
symptoms
signs
and
laboratory
tests
in
diagnosing
women
in
perimenopause
English-language
articles
that
presented
data
relevant
to
diagnosis
of
perimenopause
were
identified
in
a
MEDLINE
search
from
1966
to
2001
References
of
these
articles
and
other
publications
also
were
reviewed
Cross-sectional
or
longitudinal
studies
of
women
aged
40
years
or
older
that
used
the
definition
of
perimenopause
as
3
to
11
months
of
amenorrhea
or
irregular
periods
included
a
premenopausal
control
group
and
reported
a
clinical
examination

Of
1246
articles
identified
16
studies
were
included
in
the
analysis
Two
authors
independently
reviewed
articles
for
quality
(LAB
and
CMS)
Discrepancies
were
resolved
by
a
third

The

No
one
symptom
or
test
is
accurate
enough
by
itself
to
rule
in
or
rule
out
perimenopause
Clinicians
should
diagnose
perimenopause
based
on
menstrual
history
and
age
without
relying
on
laboratory
test
results
