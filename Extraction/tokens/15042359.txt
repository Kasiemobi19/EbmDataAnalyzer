Title
Randomized
controlled
trial
of
screening
for
hepatocellular
carcinoma
Abstract
Text
Screening
for
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(HCC)
has
been
conducted
for
over
20
years
but
there
is
no
conclusive
evidence
that
screening
may
reduce
HCC
mortality
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
effect
of
screening
on
HCC
mortality
in
people
at
increased
risk
This
study
included
18816
people
aged
35-59
years
with
hepatitis
B
virus
infection
or
a
history
of
chronic
hepatitis
in
urban
Shanghai
China
Participants
were
randomly
allocated
to
a
screening
(9373)
or
control
(9443)
group
Controls
received
no
screening
and
continued
to
use
health-care
facilities
Screening
group
participants
were
invited
to
have
an
AFP
test
and
ultrasonography
examination
every
6
months
Screening
was
stopped
in
December
1997
by
that
time
screening
group
participants
had
been
offered
five
to
ten
times
All
participants
were
followed
up
until
December
1998
The
primary
outcome
measure
was
HCC
mortality
The
screened
group
completed
582
percent
of
the
screening
offered
When
the
screening
group
was
compared
to
the
control
group
the
number
of
HCC
was
86
versus
67
subclinical
HCC
being
52
(605%)
versus
0
small
HCC
39
(453%)
versus
0
resection
achieved
40
(465%)
versus
5
(75%)
1-
3-
and
5-year
survival
rate
659%
526%
464%
versus
312%
72%
0
respectively
Thirty-two
people
died
from
HCC
in
the
screened
group
versus
54
in
the
control
group
and
the
HCC
mortality
rate
was
significantly
lower
in
the
screened
group
than
in
controls
being
832/100000
and
1315/100000
respectively
with
a
mortality
rate
ratio
of
063
(95%CI
041-098)
Our
finding
indicated
that
biannual
screening
reduced
HCC
mortality
by
37%
