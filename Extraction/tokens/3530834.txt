Abstract
Text
In
separate
multicentre
randomized
double-blind
clinical
trials
1%
ciclopirox
olamine
cream
was
compared
with
its
cream
vehicle
and
with
1%
clotrimazole
cream
as
treatment
for
tinea
corporis
and
tinea
cruris
Patients
who
demonstrated
clinical
and
mycological
findings
consistent
with
the
diagnoses
of
tinea
corporis
or
tinea
cruris
were
included
in
the
study
Clinical
and
mycological
evaluations
were
made
pretreatment
at
the
end
of
each
of
the
four
weeks
of
treatment
and
weekly
for
the
two
weeks
immediately
following
cessation
of
treatment
In
both
studies
use
of
ciclopirox
olamine
cream
resulted
in
demonstrable
improvements
after
the
first
week
of
therapy
and
in
complete
clinical
and
mycological
clearing
in
two
thirds
of
the
patients
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
period
These
results
were
maintained
through
the
two-week
drug-free
observation
period
that
followed
the
end
of
treatment
Statistically
the
results
with
ciclopirox
olamine
cream
were
significantly
better
than
those
with
the
vehicle
and
were
equivalent
to
those
with
clotrimazole
cream
All
treatments
were
well
tolerated
