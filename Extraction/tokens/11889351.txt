Pediatric
bipolar
mood
disorder
Abstract
Text
The
diagnosis
of
bipolar
mood
disorder
(BP)
in
preadolescents
(pediatric
mania)
has
generated
considerable
controversy
in
terms
of
its
estimated
prevalence
and
validity
as
a
diagnostic
category
The
relative
paucity
of
systematic
studies
and
the
current
diagnostic
confusion
related
to
the
disorder
are
often
attributed
to
the
apparent
discontinuities
in
the
childhood
versus
adult
presentation
of
the
illness
namely
irritability
as
the
predominant
"mood"
of
mania
and
a
continuous
course
of
symptoms
The
goal
of
this
article
is
to
review
the
current
literature
and
identify
sources
of
confusion
relating
to
pediatric
mania
by
considering
results
to
date
within
a
larger
context
that
include
findings
from
studies
on
(1)
BP
illness
in
adults
(2)
mood
disorders
across
the
lifespan
(3)
the
role
of
development
in
symptom
expression
and
(4)
patterns
of
heritability
in
psychiatric
disorders
Whereas
much
remains
to
be
investigated
in
the
validation
of
the
diagnosis
for
children
integrating
results
across
studies
may
provide
a
framework
for
understanding
the
differences
in
the
presentation
of
severe
mood
disorders
in
children
and
adults
