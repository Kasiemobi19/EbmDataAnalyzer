Abstract

Home
monitors
designed
to
identify
cardiorespiratory
events
are
frequently
used
in
infants
at
increased
risk
for
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(SIDS)
but
the
efficacy
of
such
devices
for
this
use
is
unproven
To
test
the
hypothesis
that
preterm
infants
siblings
of
infants
who
died
of
SIDS
and
infants
who
have
experienced
an
idiopathic
apparent
life-threatening
event
have
a
greater
risk
of
cardiorespiratory
events
than
healthy
term
infants
Longitudinal
cohort
study
conducted
from
May
1994
through
February
1998
Five
metropolitan
medical
centers
in
the
United
States
A
total
of
1079
infants
(classified
as
healthy
term
infants
and
6
groups
of
those
at
risk
for
SIDS)
who
during
the
first
6
months
after
birth
were
observed
with
home
cardiorespiratory
monitors
using
respiratory
inductance
plethysmography
to
detect
apnea
and
obstructed
breathing
Occurrence
of
cardiorespiratory
events
that
exceeded
predefined
conventional
and
extreme
thresholds
as
recorded
by
the
monitors
During
718
358
hours
of
home
monitoring
6993
events
exceeding
conventional
alarm
thresholds
occurred
in
445
infants
(41%)
Of
these
653
were
extreme
events
in
116
infants
(10%)
and
of
those
events
with
apnea
70%
included
at
least
3
obstructed
breaths
The
frequency
of
at
least
1
extreme
event
was
similar
in
term
infants
in
all
groups
but
preterm
infants
were
at
increased
risk
of
extreme
events
until
43
weeks'
postconceptional
age
In
this
study
conventional
events
are
quite
common
even
in
healthy
term
infants
Extreme
events
were
common
only
in
preterm
infants
and
their
timing
suggests
that
they
are
not
likely
to
be
immediate
precursors
to
SIDS
The
high
frequency
of
obstructed
breathing
in
study
participants
would
likely
preclude
detection
of
many
events
by
conventional
techniques
These
data
should
be
important
for
designing
future
monitors
and
determining
if
an
infant
is
likely
to
be
at
risk
for
a
cardiorespiratory
event
