Abstract
Text
The
value
of
exercise
testing
in
women
has
been
questioned
To
determine
the
prognostic
value
of
exercise
testing
in
a
population-based
cohort
of
asymptomatic
women
followed
up
for
20
years
Near-maximal
Bruce-protocol
treadmill
test
data
from
the
Lipid
Research
Clinics
Prevalence
Study
(1972-1976)
with
follow-up
through
1995
A
total
of
2994
asymptomatic
North
American
women
aged
30
to
80
years
without
known
cardiovascular
disease
Cardiovascular
and
all-cause
mortality
There
were
427
(14%)
deaths
during
20
years
of
follow-up
of
which
147
were
due
to
cardiovascular
causes
Low
exercise
capacity
low
heart
rate
recovery
(HRR)
and
not
achieving
target
heart
rate
were
independently
associated
with
increased
all-cause
and
cardiovascular
mortality
There
was
no
increased
cardiovascular
death
risk
for
exercise-induced
ST-segment
depression
(age-adjusted
hazard
ratio
102
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
057-180
P
=96)
The
age-adjusted
hazard
ratio
for
cardiovascular
death
for
every
metabolic
equivalent
(MET)
decrement
in
exercise
capacity
was
120
(95%
CI
118-130
P<001)
for
every
10
beats
per
minute
decrement
in
HRR
the
hazard
ratio
was
136
(95%
CI
119-155
P<001)
After
adjusting
for
multiple
other
risk
factors
women
who
were
below
the
median
for
both
exercise
capacity
and
HRR
had
a
35-fold
increased
risk
of
cardiovascular
death
(95%
CI
157-786
P
=002)
compared
with
those
above
the
median
for
both
variables
Among
women
with
low
risk
Framingham
scores
those
with
below
median
levels
of
both
exercise
capacity
and
HRR
had
significantly
increased
risk
compared
with
women
who
had
above
median
levels
of
these
2
exercise
variables
445
and
35
cardiovascular
deaths
per
10
000
person-years
respectively
(hazard
ratio
for
cardiovascular
death
1293
95%
CI
562-2973
P<001)
The
prognostic
value
of
exercise
testing
in
asymptomatic
women
derives
not
from
electrocardiographic
ischemia
but
from
fitness-related
variables
