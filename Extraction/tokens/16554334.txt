observational

Abstract
Text
To
estimate
the
number
of
deaths
and
readmissions
associated
with
delay
in
operation
after
femoral
fracture
Analysis
of
inpatient
hospital
episode
statistics
NHS
hospital
trusts
in
England
with
at
least
100
admissions
for
fractured
neck
of
femur
during
the
study
period
Patients
People
aged
>
or
=
65
admitted
from
home
with
fractured
neck
of
femur
and
discharged
between
April
2001
and
March
2004
In
hospital
mortality
and
emergency
readmission
within
28
days
There
were
129522
admissions
for
fractured
neck
of
femur
in
151
trusts
with
18508
deaths
in
hospital
(143%)
Delay
in
operation
was
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
death
in
hospital
which
was
reduced
but
persisted
after
adjustment
for
comorbidity
For
all
deaths
in
hospital
the
odds
ratio
for
more
than
one
day's
delay
relative
to
one
day
or
less
was
127
(95%
confidence
interval
123
to
132)
after
adjustment
for
comorbidity
The
proportion
with
more
than
two
days'
delay
ranged
from
11%
to
624%
between
trusts
If
death
rates
in
patients
with
at
most
one
day's
delay
had
been
repeated
throughout
all
151
trusts
in
this
study
there
would
have
been
an
average
of
581
(478
to
683)
fewer
total
deaths
per
year
(94%
of
the
total)
There
was
little
evidence
of
an
association
between
delay
and
emergency
readmission
Delay
in
operation
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
death
but
not
readmission
after
a
fractured
neck
of
femur
even
with
adjustment
for
comorbidity
and
there
is
wide
variation
between
trusts
