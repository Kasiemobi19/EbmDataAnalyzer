Abstract
Text
A
multi-dose
double-blind
randomized
placebo-controlled
multicenter
study
was
conducted
to
evaluate
68
patients
with
acute
bursitis
or
tendinitis
following
treatment
with
flurbiprofen
(Ansaid
Upjohn)
or
placebo
Flurbiprofen
was
administered
in
a
total
daily
dosage
of
200
to
300
mg
four
times
daily
Based
on
efficacy
rating
scales
flurbiprofen-treated
patients
had
the
greatest
proportion
of
improvement
at
almost
all
time
periods
They
also
showed
statistically
significant
improvement
compared
with
placebo-treated
patients
according
to
investigators'
overall
assessments
at
all
time
periods
Most
patients
showed
improvement
within
three
to
four
days
of
treatment
Flurbiprofen
was
both
well
tolerated
and
effective
for
the
relief
of
pain
caused
by
bursitis
or
tendinitis
of
the
shoulder
