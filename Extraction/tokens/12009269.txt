Pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
a
systematic
review
of
clinical
effectiveness
in
adults
Abstract
Text
Pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine
is
recommended
in
western
countries
for
individuals
at
high
risk
of
pneumococcal
illness
We
undertook
a
systematic
review
of
randomised
controlled
trials
of
pneumococcal
vaccine
in
adults
to
determine
the
effects
on
clinical
outcomes
RESULTS
In
industrialised
populations
no
benefit
was
detected
for
outcomes
other
than
pneumococcal
bacteraemia
and
this
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
In
non-industrial
populations
clear
benefit
was
demonstrated
for
mortality
and
all-cause
pneumonia
CONCLUSION
Benefit
from
pneumococcal
vaccination
depends
on
the
baseline
risk
of
infection
and
characteristics
of
a
given
population
Evidence
from
randomised
trials
for
widespread
adult
vaccination
in
industrial
countries
is
lacking
