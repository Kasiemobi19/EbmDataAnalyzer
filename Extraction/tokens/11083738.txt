Baseline
predictors
of
tolerability
to
carvedilol
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
Abstract
Text
To
determine
baseline
predictors
of
tolerance
to
the
alpha/beta
blocker
carvedilol
in
everyday
clinical
practice
Retrospective
analysis
of
tolerance
to
carvedilol
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure
Tolerance
was
defined
as
currently
on
carvedilol
or
on
it
at
the
time
of
death
or
heart
transplantation
To
meet
the
criteria
for
tolerance
carvedilol
had
to
be
prescribed
at
a
stable
dose
for
>/=
3
months
Everyday
clinical
practice
comprising
both
hospital
specialist
practice
and
private
practice
Tolerance
was
assessed
in
all
patients
prescribed
carvedilol
for
chronic
heart
failure
in
those
practices
808
consecutive
patients
in
both
hospital
specialist
(611
patients)
and
private
practice
(197
patients)
Baseline
predictors
of
tolerance
assessed
by
proportional
hazards
analysis
Both
univariate
and
multivariate
analyses
were
performed
Within
the
entire
cohort
of
808
patients
95
had
stopped
carvedilol
606
were
currently
receiving
the
drug
50
had
died
and
44
had
received
a
heart
transplant
Overall
88%
of
patients
tolerated
carvedilol
(87%
in
the
hospital
specialist
group
92%
in
the
private
practitioner
group)
Factors
that
indicated
impaired
tolerance
by
univariate
analysis
were
increased
age
in
years
(hazard
ratio
101
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
10
to
13)
low
diastolic
blood
pressure
(hazard
ratio
104
95%
CI
102
to
108)
and
raised
plasma
urea
concentration
(hazard
ratio
104
95%
CI
102
to
105)
New
York
Heart
Association
(NYHA)
class
was
also
a
marker
of
tolerance
(proportion
not
tolerated
3%
class
I
9%
class
II
13%
class
III
22%
class
IV)
By
multivariate
analysis
no
single
baseline
variable
was
an
independent
marker
of
inability
to
tolerate
carvedilol
Tolerance
was
also
assessed
in
relation
to
traditional
precautions
or
relative
contraindications
to
beta
blockade
Tolerance
in
these
subgroups
was
chronic
obstructive
airways
disease/asthma
85%
(89
patients)
diabetes
86%
(127
patients)
peripheral
vascular
disease
84%
(58
patients)
concomitant
amiodarone
treatment
83%
(230
patients)
and
heart
rate
<
70
beats/min
84%
(184
patients)
beta
Blocker
treatment
was
well
tolerated
in
everyday
clinical
practice
including
non-hospital-based
private
practice
There
was
no
single
predictor
of
poor
tolerance
on
multivariate
analysis
although
there
was
a
clear
association
with
NYHA
class
as
well
as
age
diastolic
blood
pressure
and
plasma
urea
on
univariate
analysis
Carvedilol
was
tolerated
well
among
selected
patients
with
traditional
contraindications
to
beta
blockade
in
this
situation
