Exercise-induced
silent
myocardial
ischemia
and
coronary
morbidity
and
mortality
in
middle-aged
men
Abstract
Text
We
investigated
the
prognostic
significance
of
exercise-induced
silent
myocardial
ischemia
in
both
high
and
low
risk
men
with
no
prior
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
Silent
ischemia
predicts
future
coronary
events
in
patients
with
CHD
but
there
is
little
evidence
of
its
prognostic
significance
in
subjects
free
of
CHD
We
investigated
the
association
of
silent
ischemia
as
defined
by
ST
depression
during
and
after
maximal
symptom-limited
exercise
test
with
coronary
risk
in
a
population-based
sample
of
men
with
no
prior
CHD
followed
for
10
years
on
average
Silent
ischemia
during
exercise
was
associated
with
a
59-fold
(95%
CI
23
to
118)
CHD
mortality
in
smokers
38-fold
(95%
CI
19
to
79)
in
hypercholesterolemic
men
and
47-fold
(95%
CI
24
to
91)
in
hypertensive
men
adjusting
for
other
risk
factors
The
respective
relative
risks
(RRs)
of
any
acute
coronary
event
were
30
(95%
CI
17
to
51)
19
(95%
CI
12
to
31)
and
22
(95%
CI
14
to
35)
These
associations
were
weaker
in
men
without
these
risk
factors
Furthermore
silent
ischemia
after
exercise
was
a
stronger
predictor
for
the
risk
of
acute
coronary
events
and
CHD
death
in
smokers
and
in
hypercholesterolemic
and
hypertensive
men
than
in
men
without
risk
factors
Exercise-induced
silent
myocardial
ischemia
was
a
strong
predictor
of
CHD
in
men
with
any
conventional
risk
factor
emphasizing
the
importance
of
exercise
testing
to
identify
asymptomatic
high
risk
men
who
could
benefit
from
risk
reduction
and
preventive
measures
