Abstract
Text
Tissue
transglutaminase
has
been
reported
to
be
the
target
for
endomysial
antibodies
in
celiac
disease
We
sought
to
establish
whether
immunoglobulin
(Ig)
A
class
tissue
transglutaminase
autoantibodies
can
be
considered
specific
for
celiac
disease
Serum
samples
from
136
patients
with
untreated
celiac
disease
(diagnosed
according
to
the
criteria
of
the
European
Society
for
Pediatric
Gastroenterology
Hepatology
and
Nutrition)
and
207
disease
controls
were
studied
Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA)
and
Western
blots
were
performed
using
calcium-treated
and
untreated
tissue
transglutaminase
as
antigen
Reticulin
endomysial
and
mouse
monoclonal
tissue
transglutaminase
antibodies
were
studied
by
an
indirect
immunofluorescence
method
and
gliadin
antibodies
with
ELISA
The
calcium-activated
tissue
transglutaminase
autoantibody
ELISA
was
highly
sensitive
(129
of
136)
and
specific
(194
of
207)
in
detecting
celiac
disease
The
new
autoantibody
ELISA
test
correlated
well
with
the
endomysial
antibody
test
Tissue
transglutaminase
autoantibody
ELISA
showed
a
clearly
better
predictive
potential
than
the
IgA
class
gliadin
antibody
ELISA
Immunoblots
and
ELISA
blocking
studies
showed
that
calcium
is
needed
for
the
specific
antigen-antibody
reaction
to
occur
Double
immunofluorescence
staining
in
human
umbilical
cord
with
sera
from
patients
with
celiac
disease
and
with
monoclonal
tissue
transglutaminase
antibodies
showed
complete
overlap
Calcium-activated
tissue
transglutaminase
autoantibody
ELISA
is
highly
accurate
in
detecting
untreated
celiac
disease
Tissue
transglutaminase
seems
to
be
the
target
self-antigen
for
endomysial
antibodies
