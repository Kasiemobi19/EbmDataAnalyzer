Title
Medication
augmentation
after
the
failure
of
SSRIs
for
depression
Abstract
Text
Although
clinicians
frequently
add
a
second
medication
to
an
initial
ineffective
antidepressant
drug
no
randomized
controlled
trial
has
compared
the
efficacy
of
this
approach
We
randomly
assigned
565
adult
outpatients
who
had
nonpsychotic
major
depressive
disorder
without
remission
despite
a
mean
of
119
weeks
of
citalopram
therapy
(mean
final
dose
55
mg
per
day)
to
receive
sustained-release
bupropion
(at
a
dose
of
up
to
400
mg
per
day)
as
augmentation
and
286
to
receive
buspirone
(at
a
dose
of
up
to
60
mg
per
day)
as
augmentation
The
primary
outcome
of
remission
of
symptoms
was
defined
as
a
score
of
7
or
less
on
the
17-item
Hamilton
Rating
Scale
for
Depression
(HRSD-17)
at
the
end
of
this
study
scores
were
obtained
over
the
telephone
by
raters
blinded
to
treatment
assignment
The
16-item
Quick
Inventory
of
Depressive
Symptomatology--Self-Report
(QIDS-SR-16)
was
used
to
determine
the
secondary
outcomes
of
remission
(defined
as
a
score
of
less
than
6
at
the
end
of
this
study)
and
response
(a
reduction
in
baseline
scores
of
50
percent
or
more)
The
sustained-release
bupropion
group
and
the
buspirone
group
had
similar
rates
of
HRSD-17
remission
(297
percent
and
301
percent
respectively)
QIDS-SR-16
remission
(390
percent
and
329
percent)
and
QIDS-SR-16
response
(318
percent
and
269
percent)
Sustained-release
bupropion
however
was
associated
with
a
greater
reduction
(from
baseline
to
the
end
of
this
study)
in
QIDS-SR-16
scores
than
was
buspirone
(253
percent
vs
171
percent
P<004)
a
lower
QIDS-SR-16
score
at
the
end
of
this
study
(80
vs
91
P<002)
and
a
lower
dropout
rate
due
to
intolerance
(125
percent
vs
206
percent
P<0009)
Augmentation
of
citalopram
with
either
sustained-release
bupropion
or
buspirone
appears
to
be
useful
in
actual
clinical
settings
Augmentation
with
sustained-release
bupropion
does
have
certain
advantages
including
a
greater
reduction
in
the
number
and
severity
of
symptoms
and
fewer
side
effects
and
adverse
events
