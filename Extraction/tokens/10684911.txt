Abstract
Text
Bacterial
vaginosis
has
been
associated
with
preterm
birth
In
clinical
trials
the
treatment
of
bacterial
vaginosis
in
pregnant
women
who
previously
had
a
preterm
delivery
reduced
the
risk
of
recurrence
To
determine
whether
treating
women
in
a
general
obstetrical
population
who
have
asymptomatic
bacterial
vaginosis
(as
diagnosed
on
the
basis
of
vaginal
Gram's
staining
and
pH)
prevents
preterm
delivery
we
randomly
assigned
1953
women
who
were
16
to
less
than
24
weeks
pregnant
to
receive
two
2-g
doses
of
metronidazole
or
placebo
The
diagnostic
studies
were
repeated
and
a
second
treatment
was
administered
to
all
the
women
at
24
to
less
than
30
weeks'
gestation
The
primary
outcome
was
the
rate
of
delivery
before
37
weeks'
gestation
Bacterial
vaginosis
resolved
in
657
of
845
women
who
had
follow-up
Gram's
staining
in
the
metronidazole
group
(778
percent)
and
321
of
859
women
in
the
placebo
group
(374
percent)
Data
on
the
time
and
characteristics
of
delivery
were
available
for
953
women
in
the
metronidazole
group
and
966
in
the
placebo
group
Preterm
delivery
occurred
in
116
women
in
the
metronidazole
group
(122
percent)
and
121
women
in
the
placebo
group
(125
percent)
(relative
risk
10
95
percent
confidence
interval
08
to
12)
Treatment
did
not
prevent
preterm
deliveries
that
resulted
from
spontaneous
labor
(51
percent
in
the
metronidazole
group
vs
57
percent
in
the
placebo
group)
or
spontaneous
rupture
of
the
membranes
(42
percent
vs
37
percent)
nor
did
it
prevent
delivery
before
32
weeks
(23
percent
vs
27
percent)
Treatment
with
metronidazole
did
not
reduce
the
occurrence
of
preterm
labor
intraamniotic
or
postpartum
infections
neonatal
sepsis
or
admission
of
the
infant
to
the
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
The
treatment
of
asymptomatic
bacterial
vaginosis
in
pregnant
women
does
not
reduce
the
occurrence
of
preterm
delivery
or
other
adverse
perinatal
outcomes
