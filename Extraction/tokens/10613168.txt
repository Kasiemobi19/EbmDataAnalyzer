Title
Night
splint
treatment
for
plantar
fasciitis
A
prospective
randomized
study
Abstract
Text
A
prospective
randomized
study
of
116
patients
with
plantar
fasciitis
was
performed
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
adjuvant
night
splint
therapy
in
relieving
the
acute
symptoms
of
plantar
fasciitis
Patients
were
randomized
into
one
of
two
groups
Patients
in
Group
1
were
treated
with
1
month
of
oral
antiinflammatory
medication
Achilles
stretching
exercises
and
shoe
recommendations
Patients
in
Group
2
received
identical
treatment
but
also
used
a
dorsiflexion
night
splint
for
3
months
Blinded
clinical
review
of
patients
was
performed
at
4
6
and
12
weeks
Health
status
data
Short
Form
36
also
was
collected
at
these
times
and
again
at
an
average
19
months
of
followup
Overall
68%
of
patients
reported
improvement
with
this
nonoperative
protocol
for
a
12-week
period
No
statistical
difference
was
seen
with
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
night
splint
In
addition
no
differences
in
improvement
rates
were
observed
with
gender
duration
of
antecedent
symptoms
the
presence
of
bilateral
symptoms
or
the
presence
of
a
heel
spur
Age
older
than
45
years
did
prove
to
be
a
statistically
significant
poor
prognostic
factor
for
improvement
at
the
12-week
follow-up
Short
Form
36
data
obtained
at
baseline
showed
significantly
lowered
perception
of
health
when
compared
with
age
matched
controls
Patients
in
both
treatment
groups
had
significant
improvement
in
Short
Form
36
scores
with
12
weeks
of
conservative
care
