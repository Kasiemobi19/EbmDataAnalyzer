Autoantibodies
to
tissue
transglutaminase
as
predictors
of
celiac
disease
Abstract
Text
Immunoglobulin
A
(IgA)
autoantibodies
to
endomysium
(EMA)
are
highly
specific
and
sensitive
markers
for
celiac
disease
Recently
we
identified
tissue
transglutaminase
(tTG)
as
the
major
if
not
sole
endomysial
autoantigen
An
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA)
was
established
to
measure
IgA
anti-tTG
titers
in
serum
samples
from
106
celiac
patients
with
partial
or
subtotal
villous
atrophy
43
celiac
patients
on
a
gluten-free
diet
and
114
diseased
and
healthy
controls
Results
were
correlated
with
clinical
and
histological
data
and
with
EMA
titers
In
patients
with
biopsy-proven
celiac
disease
consuming
a
normal
gluten-containing
diet
981%
of
the
serum
samples
had
elevated
IgA
titers
against
tTG
whereas
947%
of
the
control
sera
were
negative
IgA
anti-tTG
correlated
positively
with
semiquantitative
IgA
EMA
titers
(r
=
0862
P
<
00001)
An
ELISA
based
on
tTG
allows
diagnosis
of
celiac
disease
with
a
high
sensitivity
and
specificity
IgA
anti-tTG
and
IgA
EMA
show
an
excellent
correlation
further
confirming
the
enzyme
as
the
celiac
disease
autoantigen
Because
the
assay
is
quantitative
not
subjected
to
interobserver
variation
and
easy
to
perform
it
will
be
a
useful
tool
for
population
screening
of
a
hitherto
underdiagnosed
disease
