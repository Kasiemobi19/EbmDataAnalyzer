C-reactive
protein
and
other
circulating
markers
of
inflammation
in
the
prediction
of
coronary
heart
disease
Abstract
Text
C-reactive
protein
is
an
inflammatory
marker
believed
to
be
of
value
in
the
prediction
of
coronary
events
We
report
data
from
a
large
study
of
C-reactive
protein
and
other
circulating
inflammatory
markers
as
well
as
updated
meta-analyses
to
evaluate
their
relevance
to
the
prediction
of
coronary
heart
disease
Measurements
were
made
in
samples
obtained
at
base
line
from
up
to
2459
patients
who
had
a
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction
or
died
of
coronary
heart
disease
during
the
study
and
from
up
to
3969
controls
without
a
coronary
heart
disease
event
in
the
Reykjavik
prospective
study
of
18569
participants
Measurements
were
made
in
paired
samples
obtained
an
average
of
12
years
apart
from
379
of
these
participants
in
order
to
quantify
within-person
fluctuations
in
inflammatory
marker
levels
The
long-term
stability
of
C-reactive
protein
values
(within-person
correlation
coefficient
059
95
percent
confidence
interval
052
to
066)
was
similar
to
that
of
both
blood
pressure
and
total
serum
cholesterol
After
adjustment
for
base-line
values
for
established
risk
factors
the
odds
ratio
for
coronary
heart
disease
was
145
(95
percent
confidence
interval
125
to
168)
in
a
comparison
of
participants
in
the
top
third
of
the
group
with
respect
to
base-line
C-reactive
protein
values
with
those
in
the
bottom
third
and
similar
overall
findings
were
observed
in
an
updated
meta-analysis
involving
a
total
of
7068
patients
with
coronary
heart
disease
By
comparison
the
odds
ratios
in
the
Reykjavik
Study
for
coronary
heart
disease
were
somewhat
weaker
for
the
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
(130
95
percent
confidence
interval
113
to
151)
and
the
von
Willebrand
factor
concentration
(111
95
percent
confidence
interval
097
to
127)
but
generally
stronger
for
established
risk
factors
such
as
an
increased
total
cholesterol
concentration
(235
95
percent
confidence
interval
203
to
274)
and
cigarette
smoking
(187
95
percent
confidence
interval
162
to
216)
C-reactive
protein
is
a
relatively
moderate
predictor
of
coronary
heart
disease
Recommendations
regarding
its
use
in
predicting
the
likelihood
of
coronary
heart
disease
may
need
to
be
reviewed
