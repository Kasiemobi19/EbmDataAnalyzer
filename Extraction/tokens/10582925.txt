Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
risks
of
the
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
and
factors
that
may
contribute
to
unsafe
sleeping
environments
Three
year
population
based
case-control
study
Parental
interviews
were
conducted
for
each
sudden
infant
death
and
for
four
controls
matched
for
age
locality
and
time
of
sleep
Five
regions
in
England
with
a
total
population
of
over
17
million
people
325
babies
who
died
and
1300
control
infants
In
the
multivariate
analysis
infants
who
shared
their
parents'
bed
and
were
then
put
back
in
their
own
cot
had
no
increased
risk
(odds
ratio
067
95%
confidence
interval
022
to
200)
There
was
an
increased
risk
for
infants
who
shared
the
bed
for
the
whole
sleep
or
were
taken
to
and
found
in
the
parental
bed
(978
402
to
2383)
infants
who
slept
in
a
separate
room
from
their
parents
(1049
426
to
2581)
and
infants
who
shared
a
sofa
(4899
504
to
47560)
The
risk
associated
with
being
found
in
the
parental
bed
was
not
significant
for
older
infants
(>14
weeks)
or
for
infants
of
parents
who
did
not
smoke
and
became
non-significant
after
adjustment
for
recent
maternal
alcohol
consumption
(>2
units)
use
of
duvets
(>4
togs)
parental
tiredness
(infant
slept
</=4
hours
for
longest
sleep
in
previous
24
hours)
and
overcrowded
housing
conditions
(>2
people
per
room
of
the
house)
There
are
certain
circumstances
when
bed
sharing
should
be
avoided
particularly
for
infants
under
four
months
old
Parents
sleeping
on
a
sofa
with
infants
should
always
be
avoided
There
is
no
evidence
that
bed
sharing
is
hazardous
for
infants
of
parents
who
do
not
smoke
