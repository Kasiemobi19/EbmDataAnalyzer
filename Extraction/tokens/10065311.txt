Investigating
fatigue
of
less
than
6
months'
duration
Guidelines
for
family
physicians
Abstract
Text
To
develop
an
evidence-based
systematic
approach
to
assessment
of
adult
patients
who
present
to
family
physicians
complaining
of
fatigue
of
less
than
6
months'
duration
The
guidelines
present
investigative
options
making
explicit
what
should
be
considered
in
all
cases
and
what
should
be
considered
only
in
specific
situations
They
aim
to
provide
physicians
with
an
approach
that
to
the
extent
possible
is
based
on
evidence
so
that
time
and
cost
are
minimized
and
detection
and
management
of
the
cause
of
the
fatigue
are
optimized
MEDLINE
was
searched
from
1966
to
1997
using
the
key
words
"family
practice"
and
"fatigue"
Articles
about
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
were
excluded
Articles
with
level
3
evidence
were
found
but
no
randomized
trials
cohort
studies
or
case-control
studies
were
found
Articles
looking
specifically
at
the
epidemiology
demographics
investigations
and
diagnoses
of
patients
with
fatigue
were
chosen
Articles
based
on
studies
at
referral
and
specialty
centres
were
given
less
weight
than
those
based
on
studies
in
family
physicians'
offices
Adherence
to
these
guidelines
will
decrease
the
cost
of
investigating
the
symptom
of
fatigue
and
optimize
diagnosis
and
management
This
needs
to
be
proved
in
practice
however
and
with
research
that
produces
level
1
and
2
evidence
Adults
presenting
with
fatigue
of
less
than
6
months'
duration
should
be
assessed
for
psychosocial
causes
and
should
have
a
focused
history
and
physical
examination
to
determine
whether
further
investigations
should
be
done
The
guidelines
outline
investigations
to
be
considered
The
elderly
require
special
consideration
These
guidelines
have
group
validation
but
they
need
to
be
tested
by
more
physicians
in
various
locations
and
types
of
practices
