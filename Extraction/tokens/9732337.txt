Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
tight
control
of
blood
pressure
prevents
macrovascular
and
microvascular
complications
in
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
Randomised
controlled
trial
comparing
tight
control
of
blood
pressure
aiming
at
a
blood
pressure
of
<150/85
mm
Hg
(with
the
use
of
an
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
captopril
or
a
beta
blocker
atenolol
as
main
treatment)
with
less
tight
control
aiming
at
a
blood
pressure
of
<180/105
mm
Hg

20
hospital
based
clinics
in
England
Scotland
and
Northern
Ireland
1148
hypertensive
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
(mean
age
56
mean
blood
pressure
at
entry
160/94
mm
Hg)
758
patients
were
allocated
to
tight
control
of
blood
pressure
and
390
patients
to
less
tight
control
with
a
median
follow
up
of
84
years
Predefined
clinical
end
points
fatal
and
non-fatal
related
to
diabetes
deaths
related
to
diabetes
and
all
cause
mortality
Surrogate
measures
of
microvascular
disease
included
urinary
albumin
excretion
and
retinal
photography
Mean
blood
pressure
during
follow
up
was
significantly
reduced
in
the
group
assigned
tight
blood
pressure
control
(144/82
mm
Hg)
compared
with
the
group
assigned
to
less
tight
control
(154/87
mm
Hg)
(P<00001)
Reductions
in
risk
in
the
group
assigned
to
tight
control
compared
with
that
assigned
to
less
tight
control
were
24%
in
diabetes
related
end
points
(95%
confidence
interval
8%
to
38%)
(P=00046)
32%
in
deaths
related
to
diabetes
(6%
to
51%)
(P=0019)
44%
in
strokes
(11%
to
65%)
(P=0013)
and
37%
in
microvascular
end
points
(11%
to
56%)
(P=00092)
predominantly
owing
to
a
reduced
risk
of
retinal
photocoagulation
There
was
a
non-significant
reduction
in
all
cause
mortality
After
nine
years
of
follow
up
the
group
assigned
to
tight
blood
pressure
control
also
had
a
34%
reduction
in
risk
in
the
proportion
of
patients
with
deterioration
of
retinopathy
by
two
steps
(99%
confidence
interval
11%
to
50%)
(P=00004)
and
a
47%
reduced
risk
(7%
to
70%)
(P=0004)
of
deterioration
in
visual
acuity
by
three
lines
of
the
early
treatment
of

retinopathy
study
(ETDRS)
chart
After
nine
years
of
follow
up
29%
of
patients
in
the
group
assigned
to
tight
control
required
three
or
more
treatments
to
lower
blood
pressure
to
achieve
target
blood
pressures
Tight
blood
pressure
control
in
patients
with
hypertension
and
type
2
diabetes
achieves
a
clinically
important
reduction
in
the
risk
of
deaths
related
to
diabetes
complications
related
to
diabetes
progression
of
diabetic
retinopathy
and
deterioration
in
visual
acuity
