Abstract
Text
We
prospectively
examined
whether
febrile
infants
younger
than
2
months
of
age
who
were
defined
as
being
at
low
risk
for
having
bacterial
infection
could
be
observed
as
outpatients
without
the
usual
complete
evaluation
for
sepsis
and
without
antibiotic
treatment
A
total
of
237
previously
healthy
febrile
infants
were
seen
at
the
Pediatric
Emergency
Room
over
17
1/2
months
One
hundred
forty-eight
infants
(63%)
fulfilled
the
criteria
for
being
at
low
risk
no
physical
findings
consisting
of
soft
tissue
or
skeletal
infections
no
purulent
otitis
media
normal
urinalysis
less
than
25
white
blood
cells
per
high-power
field
on
microsopic
stool
examination
peripheral
leukocyte
count
5000
to
15000/mm3
with
less
than
1500
band
cells/mm3
One
infant
appeared
too
ill
to
be
included
and
had
sepsis
and
meningitis
None
of
the
148
infants
at
low
risk
had
bacterial
infections
versus
21
of
88
(24%)
of
those
at
high
risk
(P
less
than
00001)
eight
of
88
(9%)
had
bacteremia
Of
the
148
infants
classified
as
being
at
low
risk
for
having
bacterial
infection
62
(42%)
were
discharged
to
home
and
72
(49%)
were
initially
observed
for
less
than
or
equal
to
24
hours
and
then
discharged
Seventeen
infants
(11%)
were
hospitalized
in
six
low
risk
became
high
risk
six
had
indications
other
than
fever
and
five
because
the
study
physicians
could
not
be
found
The
137
nontreated
infants
were
closely
observed
as
outpatients
The
duration
of
fever
was
less
than
48
hours
in
42%
and
less
than
96
hours
in
91%
All
infants
were
observed
for
at
least
10
days
after
the
last
examination
The
fever
resolved
spontaneously
in
all
infants
but
two
with
otitis
media
who
were
treated
as
outpatients
Our
data
suggest
that
management
of
fever
in
selected
young
infants
as
outpatients
is
feasible
if
meticulous
follow-up
is
provided
