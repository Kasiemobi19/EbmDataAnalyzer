of
hospital
policies
based

Abstract
Text
To
determine
whether
the
1996
consensus
guidelines
for
prevention
of
early-onset
group
B
streptococcal
disease
developed
by
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
ACOG
and
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
are
affecting
obstetric
practice
and
disease
occurrence
Personnel
in
hospitals
with
obstetric
services
in
seven
surveillance
areas
completed
surveys
about
their
programs
patient
populations
and
group
B
streptococcal
disease
prevention
policies
Survey
results
were
linked
to
group
B
streptococcal
disease
cases
identified
by
active
surveillance
in
1996
and
1997
An
early
onset
case
was
defined
as
a
case
in
which
group
B
streptococci
were
isolated
from
a
sterile
site
in
the
1st
6
days
of
life
The
number
of
cases
in
1996
and
1997
were
compared
using
a
paired
t
test
Linear
regression
was
used
to
assess
hospital
characteristics
associated
with
group
B
streptococcal
disease
cases
Of
177
hospitals
165
(93%)
responded
and
96
(58%)
of
those
had
group
B
streptococcal
disease
prevention
policies
Hospitals
that
established
or
revised
their
policies
in
1996
had
a
lower
mean
number
of
cases
in
1997
than
in
1996
(058
versus
129
P
=
006)
Linear
regression
analysis
controlling
for
number
of
births
indicated
that
a
hospital's
having
more
black
mothers
and
location
in
particular
states
were
associated
with
more
cases
of
disease
Citing
the
1996
ACOG
reference
as
the
source
for
hospital
group
B
streptococcal
disease
prevention
policy
was
associated
with
fewer
cases
of
group
B
streptococcal
disease
(P
=
038)
The
publication
and
adoption
of
the
guidelines
were
associated
with
decreasing
occurrence
of
group
B
streptococcal
disease
