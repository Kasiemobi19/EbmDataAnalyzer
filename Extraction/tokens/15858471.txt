Tacrolimus
ointment
is
more
effective
than
pimecrolimus
cream
with
a
similar
safety
profile
in
the
treatment
of
atopic
dermatitis
results
from
3
randomized

studies
Abstract
Text
To
compare
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
tacrolimus
ointment
and
pimecrolimus
cream
in
adult
and
pediatric
patients
with
mild
to
very
severe
atopic
dermatitis
(AD)
One
thousand
and
sixty-five
patients
were
randomized
to
treatment
in
3
multicenter
randomized
investigator-blinded
6-week
studies
Based
on
the
Eczema
Area
Severity
Index
(EASI)
tacrolimus
ointment
was
more
effective
than
pimecrolimus
cream
at
the
end
of
the
study
in
adults
(541%
vs
349%
respectively
P
<
0001)
in
children
with
moderate/severe
disease
(672%
vs
564%
respectively
P
=
04)
in
the
combined
analysis
(528%
vs
391%
respectively
P
<
0001)
and
at
week
1
in
children
with
mild
disease
(392%
vs
312%
respectively
P
=
04)
Tacrolimus
was
also
more
effective
than
pimecrolimus
based
on
the
Investigator
Global
AD
Assessment

improvement
in
percentage
of
total
body
surface
area
affected
and
improvement
in
itch
scores
(P
<
or
=
05)
with
a
faster
onset
of
action
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
incidence
of
adverse
events
(AEs)
including
application
site
reactions
in
the
2
studies
involving
650
children
Adults
treated
with
tacrolimus
experienced
a
greater
number
of
local
application
site
reactions
on
day
1
both
groups
reported
a
similar
incidence
of
application
site
reactions
thereafter
More
pimecrolimus-treated
patients
than
tacrolimus-treated
patients
withdrew
from
the
studies
because
of
a
lack
of
efficacy
(P
<
or
=
03)
or
adverse
events
(P
=
002
pediatric
mild)
Tacrolimus
ointment
is
more
effective
and
has
a
faster
onset
of
action
than
pimecrolimus
cream
in
adults
and
children
with
AD
their
safety
profiles
are
similar
