Title
Association
of
dietary
intake
of
fat
and
fatty
acids
with
risk
of
breast
cancer
Abstract
Text
High
intakes
of
fat
and
specific
fatty
acids
including
total
animal
saturated
polyunsaturated
and
trans-unsaturated
fats
have
been
postulated
to
increase
breast
cancer
risk
To
determine
whether
intakes
of
fat
and
fatty
acids
are
associated
with
breast
cancer
Cohort
study
(Nurses'
Health
Study)
conducted
in
the
United
States
beginning
in
1976
A
total
of
88795
women
free
of
cancer
in
1980
and
followed
up
for
14
years
Relative
risk
(RR)
of
invasive
breast
cancer
for
an
incremental
increase
of
fat
intake
ascertained
by
food
frequency
questionnaire
in
1980
1984
1986
and
1990
A
total
of
2956
women
were
diagnosed
as
having
breast
cancer
Compared
with
women
obtaining
301%
to
35%
of
energy
from
fat
women
consuming
20%
or
less
had
a
multivariate
RR
of
breast
cancer
of
115
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
073-180)
In
multivariate
models
the
RR
(95%
CI)
for
a
5%-of-energy
increase
was
097
(094-100)
for
total
fat
098
(096-101)
for
animal
fat
097
(093-102)
for
vegetable
fat
094
(088-101)
for
saturated
fat
091
(079-104)
for
polyunsaturated
fat
and
094
(088-100)
for
monounsaturated
fat
For
a
1%
increase
in
energy
from
trans-unsaturated
fat
the
values
were
092
(086-098)
and
for
a
01%
increase
in
energy
from
omega-3
fat
from
fish
the
values
were
109
(103-116)
In
a
model
including
fat
protein
and
energy
the
RR
for
a
5%
increase
in
total
fat
which
can
be
interpreted
as
the
risk
of
substituting
this
amount
of
fat
for
an
equal
amount
of
energy
from
carbohydrate
was
096
(95%
CI
093-099)
In
similar
models
no
significant
association
of
risk
was
evident
with
any
major
types
of
fat
We
found
no
evidence
that
lower
intake
of
total
fat
or
specific
major
types
of
fat
was
associated
with
a
decreased
risk
of
breast
cancer
