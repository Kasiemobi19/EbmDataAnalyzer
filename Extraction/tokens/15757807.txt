Title
Screening
for
hepatocellular
carcinoma
Abstract
Text
There
is
currently
no
evidence
that
screening
patients
at
risk
for
hepatocellular
carcinoma
reduces
mortality
from
the
disease
Nonetheless
screening
is
widely
practiced
Screening
is
a
process
that
includes
selecting
patients
applying
screening
tests
deciding
on
recall
policies
and
subsequently
proving
or
disproving
the
presence
of
cancer
The
literature
on
screening
for
hepatocellular
carcinoma
is
confusing
at
best
and
does
not
adequately
consider
the
many
biases
that
result
from
uncontrolled
and
retrospective
studies
Nonetheless
screening
can
be
justified
because
it
is
likely
that
mortality
is
decreased
by
adequate
treatment
of
small
cancers
particularly
in
the
era
of
liver
transplantation
False-positive
screening
test
results
are
common
Once
an
abnormal
screening
result
is
obtained
there
is
little
guidance
from
the
literature
as
to
how
patients
should
be
investigated
further
nor
about
how
to
determine
whether
the
screening
test
result
was
a
false-positive
This
should
at
minimum
include
short
interval
follow-up
with
CT
scans
and
MRI's
