Title
Effectiveness
of
acupuncture
for
treatment
of
childhood
constipation
Abstract
Text
The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
examine
the
influence
of
acupuncture
on
chronic
constipation
in
children
and
to
investigate
their
basal
plasma
panopioid
level
and
the
changes
of
this
treatment
Seventeen
children
constipated
for
at
least
six
months
were
treated
by
five
weekly
placebo
acupuncture
sessions
followed
by
10
weekly
true
acupuncture
sessions
Their
parents
filled
a
bowel
habit
questionnaire
Panopioid
activity
was
measured
at
time
0
and
after
5
10
and
15
acupuncture
sessions
The
frequency
of
bowel
movements
in
males
increased
more
gradually
compared
to
females
and
reached
a
maximal
improvement
only
after
10
true
acupuncture
sessions
from
14
+/-
06/week
to
44
+/-
06/week
and
females
from
14
+/-
03/week
up
to
56
+/-
12/week
The
basal
panopioid
activity
was
lower
in
constipated
children
as
compared
to
the
control
population
and
increased
gradually
up
to
control
level
after
10
true
acupuncture
sessions
This
study
is
the
first
to
describe
a
successful
treatment
by
acupuncture
of
constipated
children
