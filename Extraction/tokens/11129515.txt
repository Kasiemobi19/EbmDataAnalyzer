in
patients
with
pre-menstrual
syndrome
(PMS)
Abstract
Text
In
a
prospective
multicentre
trial
the
efficacy
of
an
Vitex
agnus
castus
L
extract
Ze
440
was
investigated
in
50
patients
with
pre-menstrual
syndrome
(PMS)
The
patients
were
treated
daily
with
one
tablet
(20
mg
native
extract)
during
three
menstrual
cycles
43
patients
completed
the
study
protocol
which
encompassed
8
menstrual
cycles
(2
baseline
3
treatment
and
3
post-treatment)
13/43
patients
were
receiving
concomitant
oral
contraceptives
6
patients
did
not
complete
the
study
for
reasons
not
related
to
study
medication
and
one
patient
complained
of
fatigue
possibly
related
to
study
medication
All
evaluated
patients
took
at
least
85%
of
the
prescribed
medication
The
main
effect
parameter
was
the
validated
Moos'
menstrual
distress
questionnaire
(MMDQ)
and
secondary
parameters
were
a
visual
analogue
scale
(VAS
self-assessment)
and
a
global
impression
scale
(GI
self-assessment)
The
study
population
was
homogenous
in
age
(313+/-77
years)
weight
(589+/-69
kg)
and
cycle
length
(284+/-03
d)
The
diagnosis
was
according
to
DMS-III
At
the
end
of
the
study
PMS-related
symptoms
were
reduced
by
treatment
There
was
a
significant
score
reduction
(425%)
of
the
MMDQ
as
the
main
effect
parameter
(p<0001)
Symptoms
gradually
returned
after
treatment
cessation
However
a
difference
from
baseline
remained
(20%
p<0001)
up
to
3
cycles
thereafter
20/43
patients
were
considered
"responders"
with
a
reduction
in
MMDQ
score
by
at
least
50%
relative
to
baseline
At
baseline
the
VAS
score
was
elevated
in
the
late
luteal
phase
and
low
at
the
follicular
phase
as
expected
During
treatment
VAS
score
decreased
in
the
late
luteal
phase
(472%
p<001)
and
remained
217%
(p<0001)
below
baseline
after
3
cycles
post-cessation
of
treatment
The
low
VAS
score
within
the
follicular
phase
remained
unchanged
over
the
whole
observation
period
38
patients
judged
the
global
efficacy
moderate
to
excellent
5
patients
indicated
no
global
efficacy
The
number
of
days
patients
sustained
PMS
symptoms
was
reduced
slightly
from
75
to
6
Resting
levels
of
blood
prolactin
remained
within
the
physiological
range
throughout
No
differences
were
seen
between
patients
on
or
off
oral
contraceptives
20
patients
reported
37
adverse
events
(AE)
No
serious
AE
were
reported
One
patint
withdrew
after
four
days
of
treatment
due
to
fatigue
and
headache
Laboratory
safety
control
parameters
were
not
affected
In
conclusion
patients
with
PMS
can
be
treated
successfully
with
Vitex
agnus-castus
extract
Ze
440
as
indicated
by
clear
improvement
in
the
main
effect
parameter
during
treatment
and
the
gradual
return
after
cessation
of
treatment
The
main
response
to
treatment
seems
related
to
symptomatic
relief
rather
than
to
the
duration
of
the
syndrome
