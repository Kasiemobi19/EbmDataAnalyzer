Abstract
Text
To
evaluate
the
diagnostic
accuracy
of
magnetic
resonance
imaging
of
the
knee
in
identifying
traumatic
intraarticular
knee
lesions
300
patients
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
traumatic
intraarticular
knee
lesions
underwent
prearthoscopic
magnetic
resonance
imaging
The
sensitivity

ratio
for
a
positive
test
likelihood
ratio
for
a
negative
test
and
accuracy
of
magnetic
resonance
imaging
were
calculated
relative
to
the
findings
during
arthroscopy
in
the
studied
structures
of
the
knee
(medial
meniscus
lateral
meniscus
anterior
cruciate
ligament
posterior
cruciate
ligament
and
articular
cartilage)

Magnetic
resonance
imaging
is
a
satisfactory
diagnostic
tool
for
evaluating
meniscal
and
ligamentous
lesions
of
the
knee
but
it
is
unable
to
clearly
identify
articular
cartilage
lesions
