Triiodothyronine
augmentation
in
the
treatment
of
refractory
depression
A
meta-analysis
Abstract
Text
Several
trials
have
addressed
the
efficacy
of
liothyronine
sodium
therapy
in
euthyroid
nonpsychotic
depressed
patients
refractory
to
tricyclic
antidepressant
therapy
We
undertook
a
meta-analysis
of
these
trials
The
MEDLINE
database
(1966
to
May
1995)
and
published
reference
lists
were
examined
for
controlled
clinical
trials
of
triiodothyronine
augmentation
in
euthyroid
patients
with
refractory
depression
Quality
assessment
and
data
abstraction
were
performed
independently
by
two
reviewers
Results
were
aggregated
three
ways
the
relative
response
rate
compared
with
controls
accepting
each
trial's
definition
of
clinical
response
absolute
improvement
in
response
rates
and
improvements
in
depression
scores
analyzed
as
continuous
variables
without
a
prespecified
threshold
for
clinical
response
Aggregating
eight
studies
with
a
total
of
292
patients
patients
treated
with
triiodothyronine
augmentation
were
twice
as
likely
to
respond
as
controls
(relative
response
209
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
131
to
332
P
=
002)
This
corresponded
to
a
232%
absolute
improvement
in
response
rates
(95%
CI
45%
to
419%
P
=
02)
Improvements
in
depression
scores
were
moderately
large
(standardized
effect
size
062
P
<
001)
However
study
quality
was
uneven
and
results
were
statistically
heterogeneous
Among
the
four
randomized
double-blind
studies
pooled
effects
were
not
significant
(relative
response
153
95%
CI
070
to
335
P
=
29)
but
one
study
with
negative
results
accounted
for
most
of
the
intertrial
heterogeneity
in
results
Triiodothyronine
augmentation
may
be
an
effective
empirical
method
of
increasing
response
rates
and
decreasing
depression
severity
scores
in
a
subgroup
of
patients
with
depression
refractory
to
tricyclic
antidepressant
therapy
but
the
total
number
of
patients
randomized
was
small
and
additional
placebo-controlled
data
are
required
for
a
definitive
verdict
Since
therapeutic
trends
now
favor
other
drugs
future
trials
might
usefully
examine
triiodothyronine
augmentation
with
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
or
compare
potentiation
strategies
eg
lithium
vs
triiodothyronine
for
managing
refractory
depression
Such
trials
would
benefit
from
much
larger
sample
sizes
than
those
reviewed
here
