Title
Effect
of
maximal
daily
doses
of
acetaminophen
on
the
liver
of
alcoholic
patients
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Abstract
Text
Retrospective
reports
suggest
that
therapeutic
doses
of
acetaminophen
may
be
associated
with
fulminant
hepatic
failure
and
death
in
alcoholic
patients
Millions
of
patients
use
acetaminophen
the
prevalence
of
alcoholism
in
the
United
States
is
5%
to
10%
To
determine
if
hepatic
injury
was
associated
with
maximal
therapeutic
dosing
of
acetaminophen
to
chronic
alcohol
abuse
patients
immediately
following
cessation
of
alcohol
intake
(the
presumed
time
of
maximal
vulnerability)
Patients
entering
an
alcohol
detoxification
center
were
enrolled
in
a
randomized
double-blind
placebo-controlled
trial
Exclusion
criteria
were
baseline
values
of
aspartate
or
alanine
aminotransferase
greater
than
120
U/L
international
normalized
ratio
greater
than
15
serum
acetaminophen
level
greater
than
20
mg/L
or
a
history
of
ingesting
more
than
4
g/d
of
acetaminophen
Acetaminophen
1000
mg
or
placebo
was
administered
orally
4
times
daily
for
2
consecutive
days
and
liver
test
results
were
monitored
for
2
more
days
Acetaminophen
was
not
administered
until
the
alcohol
had
been
eliminated
There
were
102
patients
in
the
acetaminophen-treated
group
and
99
patients
in
the
placebo-treated
(control)
group
Demographic
data
alcohol
history
and
baseline
blood
test
results
were
similar
in
both
groups
The
mean
(SD)
aspartate
aminotransferase
level
on
day
4
was
380
+/-
267
U/L
in
the
acetaminophen-treated
group
and
375
+/-
276
U/L
in
the
placebo-treated
group
There
were
4
patients
in
the
acetaminophen-treated
group
and
5
in
the
placebo-treated
group
who
developed
an
increase
in
their
serum
aspartate
aminotransferase
level
to
greater
than
120
U/L
it
did
not
exceed
200
U/L
in
any
patient
The
mean
(SD)
international
normalized
ratio
on
day
4
was
096
+/-
009
in
the
acetaminophen-treated
group
and
098
+/-
011
in
the
placebo-treated
group
Repeated
administration
of
the
maximum
recommended
daily
doses
of
acetaminophen
to
long-term
alcoholic
patients
was
not
associated
with
evidence
of
liver
injury
