Title
High
blood
pressure
and
diabetes
mellitus
are
all
antihypertensive
drugs
created
equal
Abstract
Text
To
analyze
the
available
data
to
assess
the
benefits
of
antihypertensive
therapy
in
hypertensive
patients
with
diabetes
mellitus
A
MEDLINE
search
of
English-language
articles
published
until
June
1999
was
undertaken
with
the
use
of
the
terms
diabetes
mellitus
hypertension
or
blood
pressure
and
therapy
Pertinent
articles
cited
in
the
identified
reports
were
also
reviewed
Included
were
only
prospective
randomized
studies
of
more
than
12
months'
duration
that
evaluated
the
effect
of
drug
treatment
on
morbidity
and
mortality
in
diabetic
hypertensive
patients
We
estimated
the
risk
associated
with
combination
of
diabetes
mellitus
and
hypertension
and
the
effect
of
treatment
on
morbidity
and
mortality
The
coexistence
of
diabetes
mellitus
doubled
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
events
cardiovascular
mortality
and
total
mortality
in
hypertensive
patients
(approximate
relative
risk
of
173-277
for
cardiovascular
events
225-366
for
cardiovascular
mortality
and
173-218
for
total
mortality)
Intensive
blood
pressure
control
to
levels
lower
than
130/85
mm
Hg
was
beneficial
in
diabetic
hypertensive
patients
All
4
drug
classes-diuretics
beta-blockers
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
and
calcium
antagonists-were
effective
in
reducing
cardiovascular
events
in
diabetic
hypertensive
patients
In
elderly
diabetic
patients
with
isolated
systolic
hypertension
calcium
antagonists
reduced
the
rate
of
cardiac
end
points
by
63%
stroke
by
73%
and
total
mortality
by
55%
In
more
than
60%
of
diabetic
hypertensive
patients
combination
therapy
was
required
to
control
blood
pressure
Intensive
control
of
blood
pressure
reduced
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
in
diabetic
patients
regardless
of
whether
low-dose
diuretics
beta-blockers
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
or
calcium
antagonists
were
used
as
a
first-line
treatment
A
combination
of
more
than
1
drug
is
frequently
required
to
control
blood
pressure
and
may
be
more
beneficial
than
monotherapy
