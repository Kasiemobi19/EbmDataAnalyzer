Comparative
bioavailability
of
ferric
polymaltose
and
ferrous
sulphate
in
iron-deficient
blood
donors
Abstract
Text
Absolute
iron
deficiency
is
treated
by
correcting
the
causative
lesion
and
then
traditionally
administering
sufficient
amounts
of
ferrous
salt
to
return
the
haemoglobin
level
to
normal
and
replenish
body
stores
The
bioavailability
of
ferric
compounds
has
been
questioned
and
accordingly
their
therapeutic
role
remains
controversial
A
special
problem
is
posed
by
regular
blood
donation
where
the
frequency
of
phlebotomy
is
limited
by
the
haemoglobin
level
which
in
turn
requires
maintenance
of
an
adequate
supply
of
iron
from
dietary
sources
Since
this
latter
situation
may
not
always
occur
it
would
be
of
practical
benefit
to
have
a
form
of
supplementation
that
is
effective
and
can
be
taken
without
side
effects
These
issues
were
prospectively
examined
in
a
consecutive
series
of
otherwise
healthy
blood
donors
who
developed
absolute
iron
deficiency
anaemia
and
were
then
randomly
allocated
to
receive
60
mg
of
this
metal
as
ferrous
sulphate
twice
a
day
(Group
1
n
=
51)
100
mg
as
chewable
ferric
polymaltose
daily
(Group
2
n
=
53)
or
the
latter
product
twice
a
day
(Group
3
n
=
55)
Serial
studies
showed
that
80%
of
patients
in
Groups
1
and
3
had
reached
normal
haemoglobin
levels
by
12
weeks
but
this
figure
was
only
50%
in
Group
2
Similarly
the
proportion
of
patients
improving
their
percentage
saturation
of
transferrin
to
within
the
normal
range
was
significantly
better
in
Groups
1
and
3
than
in
Group
2
(P
<
01)
However
body
iron
stores
reflected
in
serum
ferritin
level
was
significantly
better
in
Group
1
(P
<
01)
there
was
no
difference
in
this
respect
between
Groups
2
and
3(ABSTRACT
