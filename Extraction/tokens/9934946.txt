Title
Effects
of
SSRIs
on
sexual
function
a
critical
review
Abstract
Text
Sexual
problems
are
highly
prevalent
in
both
men
and
women
and
are
affected
by
among
other
factors
mood
state
interpersonal
functioning
and
psychotropic
medications
The
incidence
of
antidepressant-induced
sexual
dysfunction
is
difficult
to
estimate
because
of
the
potentially
confounding
effects
of
the
illness
itself
social
and
interpersonal
comorbidities
medication
effects
and
design
and
assessment
problems
in
most
studies
Estimates
of
sexual
dysfunction
vary
from
a
small
percentage
to
more
than
80%
This
article
reviews
current
evidence
regarding
sexual
side
effects
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
Among
the
sexual
side
effects
most
commonly
associated
with
SSRIs
are
delayed
ejaculation
and
absent
or
delayed
orgasm
Sexual
desire
(libido)
and
arousal
difficulties
are
also
frequently
reported
although
the
specific
association
of
these
disorders
to
SSRI
use
has
not
been
consistently
shown
The
effects
of
SSRIs
on
sexual
functioning
seem
strongly
dose-related
and
may
vary
among
the
group
according
to
serotonin
and
dopamine
reuptake
mechanisms
induction
of
prolactin
release
anticholinergic
effects
inhibition
of
nitric
oxide
synthetase
and
propensity
for
accumulation
over
time
A
variety
of
strategies
have
been
reported
in
the
management
of
SSRI-induced
sexual
dysfunction
including
waiting
for
tolerance
to
develop
dosage
reduction
drug
holidays
substitution
of
another
antidepressant
drug
and
various
augmentation
strategies
with
5-hydroxytryptamine-2
(5-HT2)
5-HT3
and
alpha2
adrenergic
receptor
antagonists
5-HT1A
and
dopamine
receptor
agonists
and
phosphodiesterase
(PDE5)
enzyme
inhibitors
Sexual
side
effects
of
SSRIs
should
not
be
viewed
as
entirely
negative
some
studies
have
shown
improved
control
of
premature
ejaculation
in
men
The
impacts
of
sexual
side
effects
of
SSRIs
on
treatment
compliance
and
on
patients'
quality
of
life
are
important
clinical
considerations
