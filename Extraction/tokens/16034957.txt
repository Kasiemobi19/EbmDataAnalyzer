Title
Drugs

uncomplicated

women
Abstract
Text
Women
are
more
vulnerable
to
malaria
during
pregnancy
and
malaria
infection
may
have
adverse
consequences
for
the
fetus
Identifying
safe
and
effective
treatments
is
important
To
compare
the
effects
of
drug
regimens
for
treating
uncomplicated
falciparum
malaria
in
pregnant
women
We
searched

Randomized
and
quasi-randomized
controlled
trials
of
antimalarial
drugs
for
treating
uncomplicated
malaria
in
pregnant
women
Both
authors
assessed
trial
eligibility
and
methodological
quality
and
extracted
data
We
performed
a
quantitative
analysis
only
where
we
could
combine
the
data
We
combined
dichotomous
data
using
relative
risk
(RR)
with
95%
confidence
intervals
(CI)
Six
trials
(513
participants)
met
the
inclusion
criteria
Two
were
quasi-randomized
and
none
described
allocation
concealment
Data
were
scarce
for
the
primary
outcome
treatment
failure
One
trial
compared
artesunate
plus
mefloquine
with
quinine
and
reported
fewer
treatment
failures
at
day

with
the
combination
(RR

There
is
insufficient
reliable
research
on
malaria
treatment
options
in
pregnancy
