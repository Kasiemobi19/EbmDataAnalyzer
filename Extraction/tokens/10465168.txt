Abstract
Text
There
is
conflicting
evidence
on
the
benefits
of
foods
rich
in
vitamin
E
(alpha-tocopherol)
n-3
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
(PUFA)
and
their
pharmacological
substitutes
We
investigated
the
effects
of
these
substances
as
supplements
in
patients
who
had
myocardial
infarction
From
October
1993
to
September
1995
11324
patients
surviving
recent
(<
or
=
3
months)
myocardial
infarction
were
randomly
assigned
supplements
of
n-3
PUFA
(1
g
daily
n=2836)
vitamin
E
(300
mg
daily
n=2830)
both
(n=2830)
or
none
(control
n=2828)
for
35
years
The
primary
combined
efficacy
endpoint
was
death
non-fatal
myocardial
infarction
and
stroke
Intention-to-treat
analyses
were
done
according
to
a
factorial
design
(two-way)
and
by
treatment
group
(four-way)
Treatment
with
n-3
PUFA
but
not
vitamin
E
significantly
lowered
the
risk
of
the
primary
endpoint
(relative-risk
decrease
10%
[95%
CI
1-18]
by
two-way
analysis
15%
[2-26]
by
four-way
analysis)
Benefit
was
attributable
to
a
decrease
in
the
risk
of
death
(14%
[3-24]
two-way
20%
[6-33]
four-way)
and
cardiovascular
death
(17%
[3-29]
two-way
30%
[13-44]
four-way)
The
effect
of
the
combined
treatment
was
similar
to
that
for
n-3
PUFA
for
the
primary
endpoint
(14%
[1-26])
and
for
fatal
events
(20%
[5-33])
Dietary
supplementation
with
n-3
PUFA
led
to
a
clinically
important
and
statistically
significant
benefit
Vitamin
E
had
no
benefit
Its
effects
on
fatal
cardiovascular
events
require
further
exploration
