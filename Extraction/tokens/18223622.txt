Usefulness

as

Abstract
Text
Optimization
of
the
indications
for
nocturnal
polysomnography
in
the
diagnosis
of
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
(OSAS)
could
lead
to
significant
reductions
in
health
expenditure
To
this
end
we
assessed
the
usefulness
of
truncal
obesity
measurements
in
the
diagnosis
of
OSAS
One
hundred
ninety-two
patients
(152
men
and
40
women)
referred
to
our
clinic
with
suspected
OSAS
underwent
a
complete
polysomnography
study
and
their
BMI
and
truncal
obesity
measurements
were
obtained
Comparison
of
patients
defined
as
snorers
with
OSAS
patients
by
means
of
the
Student's
t
-test
revealed
significant
differences
in
the
truncal
obesity
parameters
such
as
waist-to-hip
ratio
(094
vs
098)
and
waist
circumference
(1007
cm
vs
1063
cm)
We
found
no
significant
differences
between
BMI
values
in
the
two
groups
Indices
of
truncal
obesity
were
analyzed
as
predictive
factors
for
OSAS
using
a
multivariate
logistic
regression
model
that
included
variable
sex
and
in
which
waist-to-hip
ratio
BMI
neck
circumference
and
age
were
analyzed
as
binary
variables
According
to
this
model
our
patients'
risk
of
suffering
from
OSAS
was
26
times
greater
if
the
waist-to-hip
ratio
was
>1
in
men
and
>085
in
women
The
risk
of
OSAS
was
also
increased
if
the
patients
were
men
or
over
52
years
of
age
Obtaining
simple
measurements
such
as
those
for
truncal
obesity
may
help
prioritize
the
use
of
polysomnography
in
patients
with
a
greater
risk
of
OSAS
Our
results
suggest
that
BMI
is
not
a
good
predictor
of
OSAS
in
a
group
of
patients
with
a
high
BMI
