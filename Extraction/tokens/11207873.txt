Hormone
replacement
therapy
and
fractures
in
older
adults
Abstract
Text
Estrogen
deficiency
in
women
is
associated
with
accelerated
bone
loss
and
estrogen
replacement
therapy
has
been
proven
to
be
effective
in
preventing
osteoporosis
and
fractures
in
postmenopausal
women
The
introduction
of
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulators
that
have
an
estrogen-like
effect
on
the
skeleton
but
have
a
different
pattern
of
effects
on
other
tissues
may
have
an
important
role
in
the
management
of
osteoporosis
in
women
in
the
near
future
In
men
androgen
deficiency
has
been
shown
to
be
associated
with
osteoporosis
Although
androgen
replacement
in
hypogonadal
men
may
decrease
bone
resorption
and
increase
bone
mass
long-term
placebo-controlled
trials
are
needed
to
better
define
the
benefits
and
risks
of
such
therapy
before
it
can
be
recommended
Sex
hormone
deficiency
is
linked
to
the
development
of
osteoporosis
in
both
women
and
men
In
women
hormonal
replacement
by
estrogen
or
the
newly
developed
selective
estrogen
receptor
modulators
may
prevent
the
development
of
osteoporosis
and
its
related
fractures
In
men
there
is
early
evidence
that
testosterone
replacement
therapy
may
enhance
bone
mass
in
hypogonadal
men
