Mild
cognitive
impairment
can
be
distinguished
from
Alzheimer
disease
and
normal
aging
for
clinical
trials
Abstract
Text
Mild
cognitive
impairment
(MCI)
represents
a
transitional
state
between
the
cognitive
changes
of
normal
aging
and
very
early
dementia
and
is
becoming
increasingly
recognized
as
a
risk
factor
for
Alzheimer
disease
(AD)
The
Memory
Impairment
Study
(MIS)
is
a
multicenter
clinical
trial
in
patients
with
MCI
designed
to
evaluate
whether
vitamin
E
or
donepezil
is
effective
at
delaying
the
time
to
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
AD
To
describe
the
baseline
characteristics
of
patients
with
MCI
recruited
for
the
MIS
and
compare
them
with
those
of
elderly
controls
and
patients
with
AD
in
another
clinical
trial
Descriptive
and
comparative
study
of
patients
with
MCI
participating
in

Memory

in
the
United

and

A
total
of
769
patients
with
MCI
107
cognitively
normal
elderly
controls
122
patients
with
very
mild
AD
(Clinical
Dementia
Rating
[CDR]
05)
and
183
patients
with
mild
AD
(CDR
10)
were
evaluated
Patients
in
the
MIS
met
operational
criteria
for
amnestic
MCI
Controls
were
recruited
in
parallel
with
the
MCI
group
underwent
the
same
assessments
and
had
a
CDR
of
0

group
Compared
with
controls
patients
with
MCI
were
most
impaired
on
memory
tasks
with
less
severe
impairments
in
other
cognitive
domains
Patients
with
MCI
were
more
likely
than
controls
but
less
likely
than
patients
with
AD
to
carry
the
apolipoprotein
E
epsilon4
allele
Patients
with
MCI
had
hippocampal
volumes
that
were
intermediate
between
those
of
controls
and
patients
with
AD
Patients
with
MCI
had
a
predominant
memory
impairment
with
relative
sparing
of
other
cognitive
domains
and
were
intermediate
between
clinically
normal
individuals
and
patients
with
AD
on
cognitive
and
functional
ratings
These
results
demonstrate
the
successful
implementation
of
operational
criteria
for
this
unique
group
of
at-risk
patients
in
a
multicenter
clinical
trial
