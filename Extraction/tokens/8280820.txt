A
prospective
randomized
study
with
mineral
oil
and
oral
lavage
solution
for
treatment
of
faecal
impaction
in
children
Abstract
Text
Faecal
impaction
with
or
without
encopresis
is
a
very
common
problem
We
performed
a
randomized
open-label
prospective
study
to
compare
the
efficacy
and
acceptability
of
the
treatment
of
faecal
impaction
using
either
mineral
oil
or
pineapple-flavoured
isotonic
intestinal
lavage
solution
containing
polyethylene
glycol-3350
(Colyte)
Thirty-six
patients
over
2
years
of
age
were
randomized
to
receive
either
mineral
oil
or
flavoured
lavage
solution
The
dose
of
mineral
oil
was
2
to
8
tablespoons
twice
a
day
for
two
days
(17
patients--Group
I)
and
of
lavage
solution
was
20
ml/kg/h
for
4
hours
on
two
consecutive
days
(19
patients--Group
II)
The
patients
were
assessed
for
the
presence
of
abdominal
faecal
masses
presence
and
consistency
of
rectal
mass
perineal
soiling
before
and
two
days
after
either
of
the
randomly
assigned
treatment
The
patients
and
parents
were
asked
regarding
the
compliance
with
treatment
side-effects
number
of
bowel
movements
after
treatment
and
willingness
to
try
similar
treatment
if
faecal
impaction
recurred
Patients
in
the
lavage
group
had
more
frequent
bowel
movements
and
showed
more
effective
clearance
of
abdominal
and
rectal
lumps
(P
<
001)
at
the
time
of
repeat
examination
at
two
days
However
they
had
some
vomiting
and
were
less
compliant
(P
<
001)
when
compared
to
mineral
oil
patients
We
conclude
that
balanced
lavage
solution
effectively
relieves
faecal
impaction
however
compliance
with
its
use
is
poorer
than
that
with
mineral
oil
