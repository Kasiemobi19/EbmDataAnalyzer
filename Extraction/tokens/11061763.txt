Predictors

in

Abstract
Text
To
develop
an
improved
model
for
the
prediction
of
bacteremia
in
young
febrile
children
A
retrospective
review
was
performed
on
patients
3
to
36
months
of
age
seen
in
a
children's
hospital
emergency
department
between
December
1995
and
September
1997
who
had
a
complete
blood
count
and
blood
culture
ordered
as
part
of
their
regular
care
Exclusion
criteria
included
current
use
of
antibiotics
or
any
immunodeficient
state
Clinical
and
laboratory
parameters
reviewed
included
age
gender
race
weight
temperature
presence
of
focal
bacterial
infection
white
blood
cell
count
(WBC)
polymorphonuclear
cell
count
(PMN)
band
count
and
absolute
neutrophil
count
(ANC)
Logistic
regression
analyses
were
used
to
identify
factors
associated
with
bacteremia
defined
as
growth
of
a
pathogen
in
a
blood
culture
The
model
that
was
developed
was
then
validated
on
a
second
dataset
consisting
of
febrile
patients
3
to
36
months
of
age
collected
from
a
second
children's
hospital
(validation
set)
There
were
633
patients
in
the
derivation
set
(46
bacteremic)
and
9465
patients
in
the
validation
set
(149
bacteremic)
The
mean
age
of
patients
in
the
derivation
and
validation
sets
were
158
months
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
152-165)
and
166
months
(95%
CI
165-168)
respectively
the
mean
temperatures
were
391
degrees
C
(95%
CI
39
0-392)
and
398
degrees
C
(95%
CI
397-398)
56%
were
male
in
the
derivation
set
and
55%
male
in
the
validation
set
Predictors
of
bacteremia
identified
by
logistic
regression
included
ANC
WBC
PMN
temperature
and
gender
Receiver
operator
characteristic
(ROC)
analysis
showed
similar
performance
of
ANC
and
WBC
as
predictors
of
bacteremia
When
placed
into
a
multivariate
logistic
regression
model
band
count
was
not
significantly
associated
with
bacteremia
Information
regarding
focal
infection
was
available
for
572
patients
in
the
derivation
set
The
percentage
of
patients
diagnosed
with
bacteremia
with
a
focal
bacterial
infection
was
not
significantly
different
from
the
percentage
who
had
bacteremia
without
a
focal
bacterial
infection
(16/200
vs
30/372)
Based
on
this
dataset
a
logistic
regression
formula
was
developed
that
could
be
used
to
develop
a
unique
risk
value
for
each
patient
based
on
temperature
gender
and
ANC
When
the
final
model
was
applied
to
the
validation
set
the
area
under
the
ROC
curve
(AUC)
constructed
from
these
data
indicated
that
the
model
retained
good
predictive
value
(AUC
for
the
derivation
vs
validation
data
=8348
vs
08221
respectively)
Use
of
the
formulas
derived
here
allows
the
clinician
to
estimate
a
child's
risk
for
bacteremia
based
on
temperature
ANC
and
gender
This
approach
offers
a
useful
alternative
to
predictions
based
on
fever
and
WBC
