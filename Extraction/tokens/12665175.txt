Corticosteroid
injection
for
treatment
of
de
Quervain's
tenosynovitis
a
pooled
quantitative
literature
evaluation
Abstract
Text
There
have
been
many
approaches
described
to
treat
de
Quervain's
tenosynovitis
but
no
definite
consensus
emerges
in
the
literature
We
conducted
a
pooled
quantitative
literature
evaluation
to
review
the
therapeutic
studies
in
the
English
language
to
determine
the
various
reported
cure
rates
All
citations
in
the
MEDLINE
and
Ovid
databases
that
addressed
de
Quervain's
tenosynovitis
were
independently
reviewed
Appropriate
studies
from
the
bibliographies
of
these
articles
were
then
obtained
Of
the
35
articles
on
de
Quervain's
temosynovitis
that
were
found
in
the
modern
literature
only
seven
allowed
for
comparison
among
potentially
effective
treatments
Studies
were
included
if
they
evaluated
or
compared
treatment
options
among
patients
and
had
defined
criteria
for
diagnosis
and
successful
treatment
These
seven
studies
were
descriptive
not
comparative
In
other
words
each
study
reported
the
proportion
of
successful
outcomes
with
different
treatments
without
a
comparison
to
a
specified
control
group
Four
hundred
fifty-nine
wrists
were
subjected
to
one
of
several
therapeutic
modalities
There
was
an
83%
cure
rate
with
injection
alone
This
rate
was
much
higher
than
any
other
therapeutic
modality
(61%
for
injection
and
splint
14%
for
splint
alone
0%
for
rest
or
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs)
It
seems
that
injection
alone
is
the
best
therapeutic
approach
to
de
Quervain's
tenosynovitis
