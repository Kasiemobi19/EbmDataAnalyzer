Systematic
review
and
modelling
of
the
investigation
of
acute
and
chronic
chest
pain
presenting
in
primary
care
Abstract
Text
To
ascertain
the
value
of
a
range
of
methods
-
including
clinical
features
resting
and
exercise
electrocardiography
and
rapid
access
chest
pain
clinics
(RACPCs)
-
used
in
the
diagnosis
and
early
management
of
acute
coronary
syndrome
(ACS)
suspected
acute
myocardial
infarction
(MI)
and
exertional
angina
MEDLINE
EMBASE
CINAHL
the
Cochrane
Library
and
electronic
abstracts
of
recent
cardiological
conferences
Searches
identified
studies
that
considered
patients
with
acute
chest
pain
with
data
on
the
diagnostic
value
of
clinical
features
or
an
electrocardiogram
(ECG)
patients
with
chronic
chest
pain
with
data
on
the
diagnostic
value
of
resting
or
exercise
ECG
or
the
effect
of
a
RACPC
Likelihood
ratios
(LRs)
were
calculated
for
each
study
and
pooled
LRs
were
generated
with
95%
confidence
intervals
A
Monte
Carlo
simulation
was
performed
evaluating
different
assessment
strategies
for
suspected
ACS
and
a
discrete
event
simulation
evaluated
models
for
the
assessment
of
suspected
exertional
angina
For
acute
chest
pain
no
clinical
features
in
isolation
were
useful
in
ruling
in
or
excluding
an
ACS
although
the
most
helpful
clinical
features
were
pleuritic
pain
(LR+
019)
and
pain
on
palpation
(LR+
023)
ST
elevation
was
the
most
effective
ECG
feature
for
determining
MI
(with
LR+
131)
and
a
completely
normal
ECG
was
reasonably
useful
at
ruling
this
out
(LR+
014)
Results
from
'black
box'
studies
of
clinical
interpretation
of
ECGs
found
very
high
specificity
but
low
sensitivity
In
the
simulation
exercise
of
management
strategies
for
suspected
ACS
the
point
of
care
testing
with
troponins
was
cost-effective
Pre-hospital
thrombolysis
on
the
basis
of
ambulance
telemetry
was
more
effective
but
more
costly
than
if
performed
in
hospital
In
cases
of
chronic
chest
pain
resting
ECG
features
were
not
found
to
be
very
useful
(presence
of
Q-waves
had
LR+
256)
For
an
exercise
ECG
ST
depression
performed
only
moderately
well
(LR+
279
for
a
1
mm
cutoff)
although
this
did
improve
for
a
2
mm
cutoff
(LR+
385)
Other
methods
of
interpreting
the
exercise
ECG
did
not
result
in
dramatic
improvements
in
these
results
Weak
evidence
was
found
to
suggest
that
RACPCs
may
be
associated
with
reduced
admission
to
hospital
of
patients
with
non-cardiac
pain
better
recognition
of
ACS
earlier
specialist
assessment
of
exertional
angina
and
earlier
diagnosis
of
non-cardiac
chest
pain
In
a
simulation
exercise
of
models
of
care
for
investigation
of
suspected
exertional
angina
RACPCs
were
predicted
to
result
in
earlier
diagnosis
of
both
confirmed
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD)
and
non-cardiac
chest
pain
than
models
of
care
based
around
open
access
exercise
tests
or
routine
cardiology
outpatients
but
they
were
more
expensive
The
benefits
of
RACPCs
disappeared
if
waiting
times
for
further
investigation
(eg
angiography)
were
long
(6
months)
Where
an
ACS
is
suspected
emergency
referral
is
justified
ECG
interpretation
in
acute
chest
pain
can
be
highly
specific
for
diagnosing
MI
Point
of
care
testing
with
troponins
is
cost-effective
in
the
triaging
of
patients
with
suspected
ACS
Resting
ECG
and
exercise
ECG
are
of
only
limited
value
in
the
diagnosis
of
CHD
The
potential
advantages
of
RACPCs
are
lost
if
there
are
long
waiting
times
for
further
investigation
Recommendations
for
further
research
include
the
following
determining
the
most
appropriate
model
of
care
to
ensure
accurate
triaging
of
patients
with
suspected
ACS
establishing
the
cost-effectiveness
of
pre-hospital
thrombolysis
in
rural
areas
determining
the
relative
cost-effectiveness
of
rapid
access
chest
pain
clinics
compared
with
other
innovative
models
of
care
investigating
how
rapid
access
chest
pain
clinics
should
be
managed
and
establishing
the
long-term
outcome
of
patients
discharged
from
RACPCs
