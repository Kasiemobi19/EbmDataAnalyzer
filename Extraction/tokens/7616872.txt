Testosterone
enhances
estradiol's
effects
on
postmenopausal
bone
density
and
sexuality
Abstract
Text
To
investigate
the
role
of
androgens
in
increasing
bone
density
and
improving
low
libido
in
postmenopausal
women
we
have
studied
the
long-term
effects
of
estradiol
and
testosterone
implants
on
bone
mineral
density
and
sexuality
in
a
prospective
2
year
single-blind
randomised
trial
Thirty-four
postmenopausal
volunteers
were
randomised
to
treatment
with
either
estradiol
implants
50
mg
alone
(E)
or
estradiol
50
mg
plus
testosterone
50
mg
(E&T)
administered
3-monthly
for
2
years
Cyclical
oral
progestins
were
taken
by
those
women
with
an
intact
uterus
Thirty-two
women
completed
the
study
BMD
(DEXA)
of
total
body
lumbar
vertebrae
(L1-L4)
and
hip
area
increased
significantly
in
both
treatment
groups
BMD
increased
more
rapidly
in
the
testosterone
treated
group
at
all
sites
A
substantially
greater
increase
in
BMD
occurred
in
the
E&T
group
for
total
body
(P
<
0008)
vertebral
L1-L4
(P
<
0001)
and
trochanteric
(P
<
0005)
measurements
All
sexual
parameters
(Sabbatsberg
sexual
self-rating
scale)
improved
significantly
in
both
groups
Addition
of
testosterone
resulted
in
a
significantly
greater
improvement
compared
to
E
for
sexual
activity
(P
<
003)
satisfaction
(P
<
003)
pleasure
(P
<
001)
orgasm
(P
<
0035)
and
relevancy
(P
<
005)
Total
cholesterol
and
LDL-cholesterol
fell
in
both
groups
as
did
total
body
fat
Total
body
fat-free
mass
(DEXA
anthropometry
impedance)
increased
in
the
E&T
group
only
We
concluded
that
in
postmenopausal
women
treatment
with
combined
estradiol
and
testosterone
implants
was
more
effective
in
increasing
bone
mineral
density
in
the
hip
and
lumbar
spine
than
estradiol
implants
alone
Significantly
greater
improvement
in
sexuality
was
observed
with
combined
therapy
verifying
the
therapeutic
value
of
testosterone
implants
for
diminished
libido
in
postmenopausal
women
The
favourable
estrogenic
effects
on
lipids
were
preserved
in
women
treated
with
T
in
association
with
beneficial
changes
in
body
composition
