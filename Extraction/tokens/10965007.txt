Predictors
of
outcome
in
severe
asymptomatic
aortic
stenosis
Abstract
Text
Whether
to
perform
valve
replacement
in
patients
with
asymptomatic
but
severe
aortic
stenosis
is
controversial
Therefore
we
studied
the
natural
history
of
this
condition
to
identify
predictors
of
outcome
During
1994
we
identified
128
consecutive
patients
with
asymptomatic
severe
aortic
stenosis
(59
women
and
69
men
mean
[+/-SD]
age
60+/-18
years
aortic-jet
velocity
50+/-06
m
per
second)
The
patients
were
prospectively
followed
until
1998
Follow-up
information
was
available
for
126
patients
(98
percent)
for
a
mean
of
22+/-18
months
Event-free
survival
with
the
end
point
defined
as
death
(8
patients)
or
valve
replacement
necessitated
by
the
development
of
symptoms
(59
patients)
was
67+/-5
percent
at
one
year
56+/-5
percent
at
two
years
and
33+/-5
percent
at
four
years
Five
of
the
six
deaths
from
cardiac
disease
were
preceded
by
symptoms
According
to
multivariate
analysis
only
the
extent
of
aortic-valve
calcification
was
an
independent
predictor
of
outcome
whereas
age
sex
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
coronary
artery
disease
hypertension
diabetes
and
hypercholesterolemia
were
not
Event-free
survival
for
patients
with
no
or
mild
valvular
calcification
was
92+/-5
percent
at
one
year
84+/-8
percent
at
two
years
and
75+/-9
percent
at
four
years
as
compared
with
60+/-6
percent
47+/-6
percent
and
20+/-5
percent
respectively
for
those
with
moderate
or
severe
calcification
The
rate
of
progression
of
stenosis
as
reflected
by
the
aortic-jet
velocity
was
significantly
higher
in
patients
who
had
cardiac
events
(045+/-038
m
per
second
per
year)
than
those
who
did
not
have
cardiac
events
(014+/-018
m
per
second
per
year
P<0001)
and
the
rate
of
progression
of
stenosis
provided
useful
prognostic
information
Of
the
patients
with
moderately
or
severely
calcified
aortic
valves
whose
aortic-jet
velocity
increased
by
03
m
per
second
or
more
within
one
year
79
percent
underwent
surgery
or
died
within
two
years
of
the
observed
increase
In
asymptomatic
patients
with
aortic
stenosis
it
appears
to
be
relatively
safe
to
delay
surgery
until
symptoms
develop
However
outcomes
vary
widely
The
presence
of
moderate
or
severe
valvular
calcification
together
with
a
rapid
increase
in
aortic-jet
velocity
identifies
patients
with
a
very
poor
prognosis
These
patients
should
be
considered
for
early
valve
replacement
rather
than
have
surgery
delayed
until
symptoms
develop
