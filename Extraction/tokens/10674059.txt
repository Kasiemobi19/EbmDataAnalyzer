Title
Meta-analysis
of
benzodiazepine
use
in
the
treatment
of
insomnia
Abstract
Text
To
systematically
review
the
benefits
and
risks
associated
with
the
use
of
benzodiazepines
to
treat
insomnia
in
adults
MEDLINE
and
the
Cochrane
Controlled
Trials
Registry
were
searched
for
English-language
articles
published
from
1966
to
December
1998
that
described
randomized
controlled
trials
of
benzodiazepines
for
the
treatment
of
insomnia
Key
words
included
"benzodiazepines"
(exploded)
"randomized
controlled
trial"
and
"insomnia"
Bibliographies
of
relevant
articles
were
reviewed
for
additional
studies
and
manufacturers
of
benzodiazepines
were
asked
to
submit
additional
randomized
controlled
trial
reports
not
in
the
literature
Articles
were
considered
for
the
meta-analysis
if
they
were
randomized
controlled
trials
involving
patients
with
insomnia
and
compared
a
benzodiazepine
with
placebo
or
another
active
agent
Of
the
89
trials
originally
identified
45
met
our
criteria
representing
a
total
of
2672
patients
Data
were
extracted
regarding
the
participants
the
setting
details
of
the
intervention
the
outcomes
(including
adverse
effects)
and
the
methodologic
quality
of
the
studies
The
meta-analyses
of
sleep
records
indicated
that
when
compared
with
placebo
benzodiazepines
decreased
sleep
latency
by
42
minutes
(non-significant
95%
confidence
interval
(CI
-07
to
92)
and
significantly
increased
total
sleep
duration
by
618
minutes
(95%
CI
374
to
862)
Patient-reported
outcomes
were
more
optimistic
for
sleep
latency
those
randomized
to
benzodiazepine
treatment
estimated
a
sleep
latency
decrease
of
143
minutes
(95%
CI
106
to
180)
Although
more
patients
receiving
benzodiazepine
treatment
reported
adverse
effects
especially
daytime
drowsiness
and
dizziness
or
light-headedness
(common
odds
ratio
18
95%
CI
14
to
24)
dropout
rates
for
the
benzodiazepine
and
placebo
groups
were
similar
Cognitive
function
decline
including
memory
impairment
was
reported
in
several
of
the
studies
Zopiclone
was
not
found
to
be
superior
to
benzodiazepines
on
any
of
the
outcome
measures
examined
The
use
of
benzodiazepines
in
the
treatment
of
insomnia
is
associated
with
an
increase
in
sleep
duration
but
this
is
countered
by
a
number
of
adverse
effects
Additional
studies
evaluating
the
efficacy
of
nonpharmacological
interventions
would
be
valuable
