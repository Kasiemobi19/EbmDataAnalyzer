Topical anaesthetic use for treating premature ejaculation: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
Abstract Text 
To assess the use of a topical anaesthetic mixture to improve premature ejaculation (PE), for which penile hypersensitivity might be a cause.
The study included 42 men divided in two groups; group A used a lidocaine-prilocaine solution and group B used an inert cream.
The tubes of cream were distributed randomly and participants asked to note any unpleasant symptoms, difficulties and the results of each attempt at intercourse, assessed by the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT).
There was a significant increase in the mean (sd) IELT, from 1.49 (0.9) to 8.45 (0.9) min (P < 0.001) in group A but not in group B, at 1.67 (0.7) to 1.95 (0.12) min (P > 0.05).
We suggest that anaesthetic cream might be effective for treating PE.
