Rethinking recommendations for use of pneumococcal vaccines in adults.
Abstract Text 
Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of disease worldwide; the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains emphasizes the importance of disease prevention by use of vaccines.
Recent studies have provided information that is useful for the evaluation of current vaccine recommendations.
Recommendations target most people who are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease.
However, higher risk has also been identified for African Americans and smokers, but these groups are not specifically targeted by current recommendations.
The vaccine is effective against invasive disease in immunocompetent people, although studies in immunocompromised subjects have found few subgroups in which the vaccine appears to be effective.
Questions with regard to optimal timing and indications for revaccination remain a challenge, because the duration of protection and effectiveness of revaccination remain unknown.
New pneumococcal vaccines appear promising but will need to be tested against the performance of the polysaccharide vaccine.
Improving delivery of the currently available pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to adults who will benefit should be a high priority.
