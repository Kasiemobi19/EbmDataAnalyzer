A randomized, controlled trial of exercise and education for individuals with fibromyalgia.
Abstract Text 
To evaluate the efficacy of a 6-week exercise and educational program for patients with fibromyalgia.
Forty-one subjects were randomly assigned to the program or served as waiting list controls.
Program outcome was assessed with a 6-minute walk test, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, a Self-Efficacy Scale, and a "knowledge" questionnaire (based on information provided during the educational sessions).
Waiting list control subjects subsequently completed the program.
Program outcome was reassessed 3 or 6 months post-program.
The program produced significant improvements in 6-minute walk distance, well-being, fatigue, self-efficacy (for controlling pain and other symptoms), and knowledge.
At followup, immediate gains in walk distance, well-being, and self-efficacy were maintained, but gains in fatigue and knowledge were lost.
Short-term exercise and educational programs can produce immediate and sustained benefits for patients with fibromyalgia.
The benefits of our program may be due to exercise or education since both interventions were given.
