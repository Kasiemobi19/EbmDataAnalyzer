Successful treatment of acne vulgaris using a new method: results of a randomized vehicle-controlled trial of short-contact therapy with 0.1% tazarotene gel.
Abstract Text 
Short-contact application of 0.1% tazarotene gel for acne was devised to minimize local adverse effects.
Its efficacy and safety are unknown.
To assess acne improvement and tolerability during 12 weeks of short-contact treatment with 0.1% tazarotene gel vs a nonmedicated gel control.
A randomized, masked, vehicle-controlled trial.
Outpatient facilities at an urban medical school and an affiliated suburban office practice.
Ninety-nine volunteers with facial acne were enrolled; 81 completed the study.
Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to each of 3 groups: T + T applied 0.1% tazarotene gel twice daily, T + V applied 0.1% tazarotene gel once daily and vehicle gel once daily, and V + V applied vehicle gel twice daily.
Patients adjusted the contact period as tolerated, between 30 seconds and 5 minutes per application.
Acne efficacy by reduction in acne lesions, treatment success (50%-100% improvement in global response to treatment) and improvement in overall disease severity.
Local adverse effects, scored from none to severe.
By week 12, T + T and T + V achieved significantly greater improvement in acne than V + V based on mean percentage reduction in noninflammatory lesions (46% and 41% vs 2%; P =.002) and inflammatory lesions (38% and 34% vs 9%; P =.01), percentage of treatment successes (64% and 61% vs 15%; P<.001), and reduction in overall disease severity (30% and 29% vs 3%; P<.001).
Local adverse effects did not differ significantly among the 3 groups after week 4.
     
      Short-contact 0.1% tazarotene gel therapy is a safe and effective new method of acne treatment.
