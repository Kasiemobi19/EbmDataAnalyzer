Magnetic resonance angiography for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis: a meta-analysis.
Abstract Text 
To review the published literature comparing the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with and without gadolinium in diagnosing renal artery stenosis, using catheter angiography as reference.
A meta-analysis was performed of English language articles identified by computer search using PubMed/MEDLINE, followed by extensive bibliography review from 1985 to May 2001.
Inclusion criteria were: (1) blinded comparison with catheter angiography; (2)indication for MRA stated; (3) clear descriptions of imaging techniques; and (4) interval between MRA and catheter angiography < 3 months and only the largest of all studies from one centre was selected in the analysis.
A total of 39 studies were identified, of which 25 met the inclusion criteria.
The number of patients included in the meta-analysis was 998: 499 with non-enhanced MRA and 499 with gadolinium-enhanced MRA.
The sensitivity and specificity of non-enhanced MRA were 94% (95% CI: 90-97%) and 85% (95% CI: 82-87%), respectively.
For gadolinium-enhanced MRA sensitivity was 97% (95% CI: 93-98%) and specificity was 93% (95% CI: 91-95%).
Thus, specificity and positive predictive value were significantly better for gadolinium-enhanced MRA (P < 0.001).
Accessory renal arteries were depicted better by gadolinium-enhanced MRA (82%; 95% CI: 75-87%) than non-gadolinium MRA (49%; 95% CI: 42-60%) (P < 0.001).
Gadolinium-enhanced MRA may replace arteriography in most patients with suspected renal artery stenosis, and has major advantages in that it is non-invasive, avoids ionizing radiation and uses a non-nephrotoxic contrast agent.
