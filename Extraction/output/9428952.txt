ASHP Therapeutic Position Statement on the safe use of niacin in the management of dyslipidemias. American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.
Abstract Text 
ASHP supports the use of niacin as an effective therapy for the management of dyslipidemias in adults.
Successful and safe therapy requires ongoing supervision and instruction by qualified health care providers to monitor the efficacy of therapy and minimize niacin's potential for adverse effects.
Because many niacin products are available without a prescription, pharmacists are in a unique position to help ensure that patients make the best use of this medication.
