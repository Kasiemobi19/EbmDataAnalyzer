Triglycerides: risk factor or fellow traveler?
Abstract Text 
An unresolved issue in preventive cardiology is whether the serum triglyceride level is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and, as a direct practical consequence, whether it has value as a diagnostic test.
Evidence published in the past year has contributed substantially to clarifying these issues.
In this review, we discuss the data that bears upon the importance of triglycerides as a risk factor and the implications of recent clinical trials directed at lipid lowering.
We then discuss the alternatives for triglyceride lowering therapy in the light of this new knowledge.
