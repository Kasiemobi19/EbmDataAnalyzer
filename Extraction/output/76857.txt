Varicose veins: A comparison of surgery and infection/compression sclerotherapy. Five-year follow-up.
Abstract Text 
A randomised controlled trial was carried out to compare the clinical outcome 5 years after inpatient surgery and outpatient injection/compression sclerotherapy.
91.3% of those originally treated by injection/compression sclerotherapy and 93.9% of those originally treated surgically were seen at follow-up.
40% of patients treated initially by injection/compression sclerotherapy and 24.2% of those treated surgically were given further treatment.
The probability of having no further treatment is significantly greater for those treated surgically.
The improved outcome after surgery increased with age, being most striking in those aged over 45.
The implications of the 5-year follow-up findings for the long-term cost of treatment are discussed.
