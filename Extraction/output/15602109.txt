Aripiprazole as an augmentor of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression and anxiety disorder patients.
Abstract Text 
More than half of anxiety and depression patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve.
We retrospectively examined whether treatment-resistant depression and anxiety disorder patients responded to and tolerated augmentation with the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole.
We report on patients with depression and anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had an incomplete response to a variety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and who received augmentation with aripiprazole.
The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I).
In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean+/-SD CGI-S was 3.8+/-1.3
at endpoint.
Fifty-nine percent of subjects received CGI-I ratings of 1 or 2, 'much improved' or 'very much improved,' in terms of their depression and anxiety symptoms at the end of 12 weeks.
Several patients showed an early (weeks 1-5), as well as sustained, response to augmentation with doses of aripiprazole between 15 and 30 mg/day.
The results suggest that aripiprazole may be effective as an augmentation for patients with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders despite initial SSRI treatment.
Because this is a retrospective case review, further prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.
