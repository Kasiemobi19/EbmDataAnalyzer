The efficacy and safety of the cytobrush during pregnancy.
Abstract Text 
The safety and efficacy of abrasive cytology, using the cytobrush, were evaluated in 300 pregnant patients.
When compared to conventional cytology obtained with a cotton-tipped applicator there was no difference in adverse pregnancy events.
Smear adequacy (containing endocervical cells) was statistically (P less than 0.01) and clinically increased from 21 to 86%.
The use of abrasive cervical cytology was associated with a twofold increase in the incidence of abnormal smears.
