Transdermal hormonal contraception: benefits and risks.
Abstract Text 
Transdermal drug delivery systems have been available in the United States for >20 years.
Since the introduction of the first transdermal patch (scopolamine) for the treatment of motion sickness, >35 transdermal patch products have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for a variety of indications that include hormone replacement therapy, nicotine replacement therapy, chronic pain (fentanyl), angina (nitroglycerin), hypertension (clonidine), and more recently, overactive bladder (oxybutynin), and contraception (ethinyl estradiol/norelgestromin). Clinical data demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the contraceptive patch; however, concerns regarding estrogen levels and reports of venous thromboembolism led to the development of 2 epidemiologic studies and, subsequently, revised product labeling.
Despite this, the contraceptive patch may be an appropriate option for some patients.
