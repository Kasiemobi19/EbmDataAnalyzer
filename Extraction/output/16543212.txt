The evidence supporting the use of honey as a wound dressing.
Abstract Text 
Some clinicians are under the impression that there is little or no evidence to support the use of honey as a wound dressing.
To allow sound decisions to be made, this seminar article has covered the various reports that have been published on the clinical usage of honey.
Positive findings on honey in wound care have been reported from 17 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 1965 participants, and 5 clinical trials of other forms involving 97 participants treated with honey.
The effectiveness of honey in assisting wound healing has also been demonstrated in 16 trials on a total of 533 wounds on experimental animals.
There is also a large amount of evidence in the form of case studies that have been reported.
It has been shown to give good results on a very wide range of types of wound.
It is therefore mystifying that there appears to be a lack of universal acceptance of honey as a wound dressing.
It is recommended that clinicians should look for the clinical evidence that exists to support the use of other wound care products to compare with the evidence that exists for honey.
