Duration of breastfeeding and risk of overweight: a meta-analysis.
Abstract Text 
Observational studies suggest a longer duration of breastfeeding to be associated dose dependently with a decrease in risk of overweight in later life.
The authors performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the existing studies on duration of breastfeeding and risk of overweight.
Studies were included that reported the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (or the data to calculate them) of overweight associated with breastfeeding and that reported the duration of breastfeeding and used exclusively formula-fed subjects as the referent.
Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria.
By meta-regression, the duration of breastfeeding was inversely associated with the risk of overweight (regression coefficient=0.94,
95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 0.98).
Categorical analysis confirmed this dose-response association (<1 month of breastfeeding: odds ratio (OR)=1.0,
95% CI: 0.65, 1.55; 1-3 months: OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.88; 4-6 months: OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.86; 7-9 months: OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.82; >9 months: OR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.91).
One month of breastfeeding was associated with a 4% decrease in risk (OR=0.96/month of breastfeeding, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98).
The definitions of overweight and age had no influence.
These findings strongly support a dose-dependent association between longer duration of breastfeeding and decrease in risk of overweight.
