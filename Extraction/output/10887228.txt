Inferior vena caval filters: review of a 26-year single-center clinical experience.
Abstract Text 
To review a 26-year single-center clinical experience with inferior vena caval filters.
During 1973-1998, 1,765 filters were implanted in 1,731 patients.
Hospital files were reviewed, and data were collected about the indications, safety, effectiveness, numbers, and types of caval filters.
Fatal post-filter pulmonary embolism (PE) was considered the primary outcome.
Morbidity and mortality were determined as secondary outcomes.
Survival and morbidity-free survival curves were calculated.
The prevalence of observed post-filter PE was 5.6%.
It was fatal in 3.7% of patients.
In most patients, fatal PE occurred soon after filter insertion (median, 4.0 days; 95% CI: 2.2, 5.8 days).
Major complications occurred in 0.3% of procedures.
The prevalence of observed post-filter caval thrombosis was 2.7%.
The 30-day mortality rate was 17.0% overall, higher among patients with neoplasms (19.5%) as compared with those without neoplasms (14.3%;
P =.004).
Filter efficacy and associated morbidity were not different in 46 patients with suprarenal filters.
The rate of filters placed for prophylaxis was 4.7% overall and increased to 16.4% in 1998.
From 1980 to 1996, there was a fivefold increase in the number of caval filter implants.
In recent years, more filters were implanted in younger patients.
Inferior vena caval filters provide protection from life-threatening PE, with minimal morbidity.
