Risk factors for non-haemorrhagic stroke in patients with coronary heart disease and the effect of lipid-modifying therapy with pravastatin.
Abstract Text 
To determine the relative importance of recognised risk factors for non-haemorrhagic stroke, including serum cholesterol and the effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy, on the occurrence of non-haemorrhagic stroke in patients enrolled in the LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease) study.
The LIPID study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the efficacy on coronary heart disease mortality of pravastatin therapy over 6 years in 9014 patients with previous acute coronary syndromes and baseline total cholesterol of 4-7 mmol/l.
Following identification of patients who had suffered non-haemorrhagic stroke, a pre-specified secondary end point, multivariate Cox regression was used to determine risk in the total population.
Time-to-event analysis was used to determine the effect of pravastatin therapy on the rate of non-haemorrhagic stroke.
There were 388 non-haemorrhagic strokes in 350 patients.
Factors conferring risk of future non-haemorrhagic stroke were age, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, diabetes, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body mass index, male sex and creatinine clearance.
Baseline lipids did not predict non-haemorrhagic stroke.
Treatment with pravastatin reduced non-haemorrhagic stroke by 23% (P = 0.016) when considered alone, and 21% (P = 0.024) after adjustment for other risk factors.
The study confirmed the variety of risk factors for non-haemorrhagic stroke.
From the risk predictors, a simple prognostic index was created for non-haemorrhagic stroke to identify a group of patients at high risk.
Treatment with pravastatin resulted in significant additional benefit after allowance for risk factors.
