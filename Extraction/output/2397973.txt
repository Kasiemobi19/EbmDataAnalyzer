Once-daily naftifine cream 1% in the treatment of tinea cruris and tinea corporis.
Abstract Text 
Seventy patients with tinea cruris or tinea corporis were treated with naftifine cream 1% or vehicle once daily for 4 weeks in this double-blind, randomized study.
After two weeks, the patients using naftifine had a significantly higher mycologic cure rate than the vehicle-treated patients (79% vs. 31%, p less than 0.001), and they showed significantly better resolution of signs and symptoms.
Statistically significantly differences favoring naftifine over its vehicle were found throughout the treatment period and 2 weeks posttreatment.
