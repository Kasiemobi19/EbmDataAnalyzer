Overview and meta-analysis of randomised trials of amiodarone in chronic heart failure.
Abstract Text 
Unlike other antiarrhythmic class I drugs, amiodarone showed in preliminary studies, benefits also in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
These positive results have induced the development of large randomised controlled studies: their results are reviewed and the controversial points are discussed.
In a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials the use of amiodarone in heart failure was associated with an approximate 20 to 25% reduction in deaths.
However, amiodarone was also associated with a 120 to 124% increase in side effects.
