Shave excision of benign facial melanocytic naevi: a patient's satisfaction survey.
Abstract Text 
Shave excision is a simple and quick procedure that is widely used for removal of benign naevi.
Limited published data are available on patient acceptability of this procedure or its potential cosmetic outcomes.
To assess the patient's satisfaction with the procedure, to assess the risk of recurrence, and to determine the patient's perception of the scar.
Questionnaires were sent to 93 consecutive patients who had shave excision of benign facial naevi.
Seventy-six patients (82%) with a total of 83 naevi responded.
Twenty-eight percent of naevi were reported to have recurred 12 months after shave excision.
A significantly higher recurrence rate was found with hairy naevi (41%, P= 0.04).
More than half of the patients reported no scar or had a white and flat scar.
Nineteen percent of scars were depressed, and 15% were raised; 7% were pigmented.
The majority of patients were satisfied with the results.
Despite a high recurrence rate, most patients were satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes after shave excision of benign facial naevi.
The results of this study have helped us to provide our patients with more accurate information regarding cosmetic outcomes.
