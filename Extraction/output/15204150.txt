Long-term safety and tolerability of pimecrolimus cream 1% and topical corticosteroids in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.
Abstract Text 
This randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study compared the long-term safety and tolerability of pimecrolimus cream 1% and topical corticosteroids (TCS) in 658 adults with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).
Patients applied either pimecrolimus or TCS (i.e.
0.1% triamcinolone acetonide cream and/or 1% hydrocortisone acetate cream) twice daily to all affected areas until complete clearance or for up to 1 year.
The study was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each centre.
A majority of patients treated with either pimecrolimus or TCS used the drug on a continuous basis over 1 year.
In patients who had >30% of the body surface involved by AD, the incidence rate of all skin infections was significantly lower in the pimecrolimus group than in the TCS group (95% CI of the treatment difference: -25.3% to -3.4%).
The most frequent application site reaction was burning (25.9% of patients on pimecrolimus and 10.9% on TCS), which was transient and mild-moderate in most cases.
Three TCS-treated patients reported skin striae.
There were no treatment-related serious or clinically significant systemic adverse events.
Efficacy was better in patients on continuous TCS therapy, although patients completing the study were similarly well-controlled in both groups.
About 42% of the pimecrolimus-treated patients were maintained for 1 year without TCS.
Pimecrolimus demonstrated a favourable safety profile when used to treat adult patients with moderate-severe AD for up to 1 year.
A significant proportion of patients could be maintained without TCS for a year.
