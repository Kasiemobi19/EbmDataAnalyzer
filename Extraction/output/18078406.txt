Clinical effects of undershirts coated with borage oil on children with atopic dermatitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
Abstract Text 
It has been reported that gamma-linolenic acid contained in borage oil is effective against atopic dermatitis.
The clinical effects of undershirts coated with borage oil rich in gamma-linolenic acid on atopic dermatitis were evaluated.
Thirty-two children, aged 1-10 years, were involved in the clinical control study.
Sixteen had worn undershirts coated with borage oil everyday for 2 weeks, and 16 had worn non-coated undershirts as a placebo.
Their symptoms were assessed on a 4-point scale.
Those children who had worn undershirts coated with borage oil for 2 weeks showed improvements in their erythema and itch, which were statistically significant.
Transepidermal water loss from the back was decreased.
In the placebo group, there were no statistically significant differences.
The undershirts coated with borage oil were found to be statistically effective, and had no side-effects on children with mild atopic dermatitis.
