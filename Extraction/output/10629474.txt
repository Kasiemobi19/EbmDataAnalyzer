Diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: summary of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research evidence-based report.
Abstract Text 
The goal was to critically examine evidence regarding the performance of diagnostic tests and the efficacy of antibiotic and other treatments for uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABR).
Scientific literature was reviewed, and meta-analysis methods were used to assess diagnostic test and antibiotic efficacy.
A decision analysis and cost-effective analysis were performed.
Although more sensitive than clinical examination for diagnosis of ABR, sinus radiograms are not cost-effective as an initial management strategy.
Antibiotics reduce the incidence of clinical failures by one half compared to no treatment and, when coupled with clinical criteria-based diagnosis, present the most cost-effective treatment strategy.
However, without antibiotics, symptoms in two thirds of patients improve by 14 days with no serious complications.
The risk of treatment failure does not differ significantly between amoxicillin or folate inhibitors and newer, more expensive antibiotics.
The current literature shows that treatment of uncomplicated ABR with amoxicillin or folate inhibitors and based on clinical criteria is the most cost-effective strategy.
