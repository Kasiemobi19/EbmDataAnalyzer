Immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage.
Abstract Text 
Immunologic aberrations might be the cause of recurrent early pregnancy loss in some women.
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of leukocyte immunisation or other immunologic treatments such as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) on the live birth rate in women with previous unexplained recurrent miscarriages.
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched (September 2002).
Individual patient data were obtained from the American Society for Reproductive Immunology.
Randomised trials of immunotherapy in women with three or more prior miscarriages and no more than one live birth; all recognised non-immunologic causes ruled out and no simultaneous treatment intervention.
Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer.
Nineteen trials of high quality were included.
The various forms of immunotherapy did not show significant differences between treatment and control groups in terms of subsequent live births: paternal cell immunisation (11 trials, 596 women), odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.75 to 1.47; third party donor cell immunization (3 trials, 156 women), OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.82; trophoblast membrane infusion (1 trial, 37 women), OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.45; intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.58.
Paternal cell immunization, third party donor leukocytes, trophoblast membranes, and intravenous immune globulin provide no significant beneficial effect over placebo in preventing further miscarriages.
