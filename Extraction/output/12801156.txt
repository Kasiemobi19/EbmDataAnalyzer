Is subjective memory loss correlated with MMSE scores or dementia?
Abstract Text 
(1) To determine if subjective memory loss (SML) is associated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, (2) to determine if this association persists after adjustment for other factors, and (3) to determine the sensitivity and specificity of SML for dementia.
1751 seniors sampled from a population registry.
Age, sex, education, SML, the MMSE, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.
Dementia was diagnosed by clinical examination.
Linear regression models were constructed.
The sensitivity and specificity of SML were determined with a diagnosis of dementia being the gold standard.
SML was correlated with MMSE scores, even after adjusting for age, sex, education, and depressive symptoms.
The sensitivity of SML was 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45, 0.71), and the specificity was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.78) for dementia.
SML is correlated with MMSE score.
However, SML is neither sensitive nor specific for dementia.
