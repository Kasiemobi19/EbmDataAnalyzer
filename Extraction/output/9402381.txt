Quinolone arthropathy in animals versus children.
Abstract Text 
The use of quinolones in children and accumulation of data on the pharmacodynamics of these drugs have been limited and delayed by concern regarding their chondrotoxicity.
A comprehensive review of the findings in animals compared with the cumulative published findings in children and adolescents (>7,000 to date) allows the conclusion that such concern is not justified.
Prospective controlled studies in children are justifiable in view of a continuing lack of correlation between findings in juvenile animals and those in children and because of the selected therapeutic advantages of the current and newer quinolones.
