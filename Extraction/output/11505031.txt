Influence of alcohol intake on risk for increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in middle-aged Japanese men.
Abstract Text 
Decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in chronic alcoholics is well known.
However, the importance of light to moderate alcohol consumption is less certain.
We investigated the association of alcohol intake with risk for increased LDL cholesterol over 5 years in a cohort of 933 Japanese male office workers aged 35 to 54 years who had LDL cholesterol levels less than 140 mg/dl and were not taking medication for dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, or hyperuricemia at study entry.
Incident-increased LDL cholesterol was defined by an LDL cholesterol level of 140 mg/dl or more or use of medication for dyslipidemia.
Each individual's slope for LDL cholesterol was also calculated with a simple linear regression model.
Three hundred twenty-one men developed increased LDL cholesterol during 3785 person-years of follow-up.
After controlling for potential predictors of increased LDL cholesterol, the relative risk for increased LDL cholesterol compared with nondrinkers was 0.89 for those who drank 0.1 to 22.9 g/day of ethanol, 0.74 for those who drank 23.0 to 45.9 g/day of ethanol, 0.64 for those who drank 46.0 to 59.9 g/day of ethanol, and 0.54 for those who drank 69.0 g/day or more of ethanol (p < 0.001).
Slopes of LDL cholesterol level decreased significantly as alcohol intake increased.
From multiple linear regression analyses, alcohol intake remained as an independent negative factor for slopes of LDL cholesterol level.
Alcohol intake is negatively associated with development of increased LDL cholesterol in middle-aged Japanese men.
