Naproxen and paracetamol compared with naproxen only in coxarthrosis. Increased effect of the combination in 18 patients.
Abstract Text 
In a double-blind study of 18 patients with coxarthrosis the effect of 3 naproxen doses (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g daily) and 2 naproxen doses combined with paracetamol (0.5 g + 4 g daily and 1.0 g + 4 g daily) was investigated.
Plasma levels of naproxen and paracetamol were measured (HPLC), and clinical assessment of pain, joint movement, activity of daily life and side-effects were performed at the end of the 5 treatment periods.
A relationship was found between the 3 naproxen doses, naproxen plasma levels, pain at rest, and pain during movement.
The combined treatment was more effective than treatment with the same naproxen dose alone.
The effect of naproxen (0.5 g daily) combined with paracetamol (4 g daily) did not differ from that obtained during treatment with higher naproxen doses only.
Furthermore, the effect of the highest naproxen dose was not better than the effect of the lower naproxen dose (1.0 g daily) combined with paracetamol.
The main finding was that treatment with naproxen and paracetamol is more effective than treatment with higher naproxen doses alone.
