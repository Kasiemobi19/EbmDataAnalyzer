Etiology of outpatient pediatric nondysenteric diarrhea: a multicenter study in the United States.
Abstract Text 
Few data have been published recently on the etiology of outpatient pediatric diarrhea in the US.
We determined the etiology of acute, nondysenteric diarrhea among 147 children between 2 and 11 years old presenting to 9 outpatient clinics in various regions of the US between August, 1991, and August, 1993.
Enteropathogens were sought by conventional laboratory methods.
The various diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were sought.
A recognized etiologic agent was detected in the stools of 89 (60.5%) children and 15 (10) patients had multiple agents detected.
Rotavirus was found in 43 (29.3%) of the children, with a spring and winter peak in occurrence.
Giardia lamblia was identified in 22 (15%) cases with a spring peak.
HEp-2 cell-adherent E. coli were found in 15 (10.2%).
Other agents found included: enteric adenovirus in 7 (4.8%);
Salmonella in 5 (3.4%); enterohemorrhagic E. coli in 5 (3.4%); enteropathogenic E. coli in 2 (1.4%); enterotoxigenic E. coli in 2 (1.4%); Entamoeba histolytica in 1 (0.70%); and Campylobacter jejuni in 1 (0.7%).
In addition to the presence of conventional enteropathogens, diarrheagenic E. coli (HEp-2 cell-adherent E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli) were associated with endemic pediatric diarrhea in the US.
