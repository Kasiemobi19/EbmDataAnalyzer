First-trimester drug use and congenital disorders.
Abstract Text 
The authors determined the prevalence of certain major congenital disorders among live-born infants of 6509 mothers in a prepaid health plan for the 30-month period of January 1, 1980 through June 30, 1982 who used a wide variety of drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy.
The results were similar to those obtained in this population in a prior 30-month study.
No strong associations between any of the commonly used drugs and the congenital disorders studied were present.
