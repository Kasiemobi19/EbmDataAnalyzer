Use of a device that applies external kneading-like force on the abdomen for treatment of constipation.
Abstract Text 
To evaluate the efficacy of a recently developed device that applies kneading-like motion on the abdomen in improving constipation in elderly long-term care patients.
Thirty constipated elderly patients were randomly selected from two nursing homes.
They were instructed to use the device once daily for 20 min.
Rate of bowel movements, volume and consistency of stool and the use of laxantia were all recorded during a 3-wk baseline period and for 12-wk treatment period.
Colonic transit time (CTT) was measured in 13 patients by radiopaque markers during the baseline and at the end of treatment.
Bowel movement rate (BM/week) increased from 1.4+/-0.4
BM/wk during baseline to 3.9+/-0.8
BM/wk during treatment (P<5.0x10(-7)).
Stool amount that was "low" in 30 patients during baseline increased in 21 patients at the end of the study period (chi2 = 19.048-P
= 1.3x10(-5)).
Stool consistency, that was "hard" in 25 patients and "soft" in 5 patients during baseline, ameliorated in 23 patients at the end of the study (only 2 patients referred "hard" stool) (chi2 = 21.043-P
= 4.0x10(-6)).
The mean baseline CTT measured was 92.3+/-32.3
h at baseline and decreased to 49.4+/-31.3
h during the study period (P = 0.000208).
No side effects were observed during the study period.
External mechanical vibration of the abdomen reduced CTT and helped to relieve severe constipation in elderly constipated patients.
