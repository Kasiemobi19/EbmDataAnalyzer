Antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infection in children: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
Abstract Text 
The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.
This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis.
Five trials involving 463 children were performed.
Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection.
Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI.
Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants.
The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal.
Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45,
P <.01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02).
Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children.
Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.
