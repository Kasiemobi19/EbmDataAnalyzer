Giant pituitary prolactinoma with falsely low serum prolactin: the pitfall of the "high-dose hook effect": case report.
Abstract Text 
We present a case of a giant prolactinoma with a falsely low serum prolactin concentration determined by a two-site chemiluminometric assay.
Awareness of the possibility of the "high-dose hook effect" in such cases will prevent preoperative misdiagnosis.
A patient with a giant invasive pituitary tumor was found preoperatively to have serum prolactin of 31 ng/ml.
Pathological examination of the excised tissue, however, demonstrated strong staining for prolactin.
Serial dilutions of the serum disclosed hyperprolactinemia of 280,000 ng/ml, establishing the presence of the "high-dose hook effect."
Treatment with pergolide (Permax; Athena Neurosciences, S. San Francisco, CA) decreased tumor size and lowered serum prolactin by more than 99%.
A "high-dose hook effect" needs to be suspected in every patient with a giant pituitary adenoma (>3 cm) and normal serum prolactin.
Subsequently assaying the diluted serum will reliably disclose this phenomenon and allow correct diagnosis and therapy.
