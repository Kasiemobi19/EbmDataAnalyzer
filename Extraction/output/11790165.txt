The combined continuous-wave/pulsed carbon dioxide laser for treatment of pyogenic granuloma.
Abstract Text 
Pyogenic granuloma is a frequently diagnosed, benign vascular lesion.
To present the use of the combined continuous-wave/pulsed carbon dioxide (CO2) laser as an innovative therapeutic method, to compare it with established methods, and to assess its results.
Prospective observational study between March 1998 and July 2000, comprising 1 treatment session with 6-week and 6-month follow-up examinations and evaluations.
Private or institutional practices as well as ambulatory or hospitalized care.
One hundred patients with pyogenic granuloma selected from a population-based sample.
Treatment with CO2 laser.
The laser was first used in continuous mode (power, 15 W) and then in pulsed mode (pulse length, 0.6-0.9
milliseconds; energy fluence, 500 mJ/pulse).
Complete resolution of treated granuloma pyogenicum.
Pyogenic granuloma was removed completely in 1 treatment session in 98 patients without recurrence.
In 88 cases there were no visible scars; in 10 cases slight textural changes of the skin were observed.
Hypertrophic scars or keloids did not occur.
Sixty-three patients were very satisfied with the result of the treatment, 37 were satisfied (ie, 100% patient satisfaction), and none indicated that they were not satisfied.
No permanent hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, or erythema was observed.
The combined continuous-wave/pulsed CO2 laser is our treatment of choice for pyogenic granuloma because this kind of laser is widely available, produces excellent results with few adverse effects, is easy to use, yields low recurrence rates, and is well tolerated by most patients.
