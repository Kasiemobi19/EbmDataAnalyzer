Effects of an exercise and scheduled-toileting intervention on appetite and constipation in nursing home residents.
Abstract Text 
To evaluate the effects of an exercise and scheduled-toileting intervention on appetite and constipation in nursing home (NH) residents.
A controlled, clinical intervention trial with 89 residents in two NHs.
Research staff provided exercise and toileting assistance every two hours, four times per day, five days a week for 32 weeks.
Oral food and fluid consumption during meals was measured at baseline, eight and 32 weeks.
Bowel movement frequency was measured at baseline and 32 weeks.
The intervention group showed significant improvements or maintenance across all measures of daily physical activity, functional performance, and strength compared to the control group.
Participants in both groups consumed an average of approximately 55% of meals at all three time points (approximately 1100 calories/day) with no change over time in either group.
There was also no change in the frequency of bowel movements in either group, which averaged less than one in two days for both groups; and, approximately one-half of all participants had no bowel movement in two days.
An exercise and scheduled-toileting intervention alone is not sufficient to improve oral food and fluid consumption during meals and bowel movement frequency in NH residents.
