Treatment of spit tobacco users with transdermal nicotine system and mint snuff.
Abstract Text 
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of nicotine patch and mint snuff (a nonnicotine product) on craving, withdrawal symptoms, and treatment outcome.
This study involved a 2 x 2 factorial design, with Active Nicotine Versus Placebo Patch as one of the factors and Mint Snuff Versus No Mint Snuff as the other factor.
Spit tobacco users (N = 402, n = 100-101 in each condition) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment conditions for a period of 10 weeks.
Treatment outcome was measured up to 62 weeks.
The results showed that the nicotine patch was effective in increasing short-term abstinence over the placebo patch and in reducing craving and withdrawal signs and symptoms from spit tobacco.
Although mint snuff was not effective in enhancing treatment outcome, it reduced craving and withdrawal symptoms.
No interaction effects were observed.
At this time, the use of the nicotine patch and mint snuff should be primarily considered for the reduction of craving and withdrawal symptoms.
