Is a knee brace advantageous after anterior cruciate ligament surgery? A prospective, randomised study with a two-year follow-up.
Abstract Text 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a knee brace after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using central third patellar tendon autografts.
Fifty patients were randomly allocated to two groups.
The patients in Group A wore a brace for three weeks postoperatively, while the patients in Group B were rehabilitated without the use of a brace.
Pre-operatively, the groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, activity level, knee laxity and muscle strength.
The follow-up examination was performed by one independent observer.
All the patients were followed up for a minimum of two years.
At the follow-up, there were no significant differences between the study groups in terms of the Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, IKDC evaluation system, one-leg-hop quotient, KT-1000 measurements and isokinetic torque.
Using the visual analogue scale, the patients in Group A evaluated their pain during the first two post-operative weeks as 1.0 (0-7), compared with 2.3 (0-9) in Group B (P= 0.04).
Furthermore, the patients in Group A had a tendency towards fewer problems with swelling, haemathrosis and wound leakage during the early post-operative period (P=0.08).
We conclude that the patients who were rehabilitated with the use of a brace had less pain and a tendency towards fewer complications during the early post-operative period than the patients who were rehabilitated without the use of a brace.
However, there were no differences in terms of function or knee laxity at the two-year follow-up.
