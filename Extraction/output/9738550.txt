Clinic-based vs. home-based interventions for preventing weight gain in men.
Abstract Text 
Weight gain occurs frequently in men aged 25-40.
This study compared the effectiveness of a clinic-based and a home-based intervention with a no-treatment control group in preventing this weight gain.
Men (n=67)-aged 25 to 40, sedentary, with a body mass index of 22 to 30, recruited from the University of Pittsburgh-were randomly assigned to 4-month treatments focused on increasing aerobic exercise and reducing fat intake through a clinic-based (CB) or a home-based (HB) program, or to a delayed-treatment control group.
Subjects were reassessed at 4 months.
Adherence and outcome did not differ significantly between the CB and HB programs, except that CB subjects recorded their food intake more frequently, and a greater number of CB subjects achieved a total of 120 miles of exercise over the 4 months.
Subjects in the two intervention conditions combined lost significantly more weight (-1.6+/-2.5 kg) than control subjects, who gained 0.2+/-1.9
kg (p<0.01); this effect of treatment was seen primarily in men with a body mass index of 27 to 30 (-2.7 kg for CB and HB combined vs. + 1.5 kg for control).
Treated subjects also had somewhat greater improvements in body composition, aerobic fitness, and weekly energy expenditure than controls, although these differences did not reach significance.
Both CB and HB intervention show promise in preventing weight gain in young men, especially in those who are slightly overweight.
Larger studies, using more representative samples of young men, appear warranted.
