Low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin) for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.
Abstract Text 
To evaluate the effect and dose of dalteparin given to pregnant women with acute venous thromboembolism.
An observational study of pregnant women in Norway.
Delivery and haematological departments in Norway.
Twenty women, aged 22-41 years, with acute venous thromboembolism verified by objective means.
Patients were treated with dalteparin from diagnosis until delivery.
Treatment was monitored with anti-activated factor Xa (anti-Xa) activity, and the dose was adjusted to achieve target 0.5-1.0
U/mL 2-3 hours post-injection.
Anti-Xa activity and side effects.
None of the patients suffered recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding complications.
In 9 of 13 women starting with conventional dose of dalteparin (100 iu/kg bd), dose escalation was necessary to reach target anti-Xa activity.
None of the six women who started with 105-118 iu/kg bd required dose escalation.
One woman who started with 133 iu/kg bd required dose reduction.
Bioaccumulation of dalteparin was not observed.
Our study suggests that dalteparin may be used for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.
Approximately 10-20% higher doses of dalteparin may be needed as compared with non-pregnant individuals.
