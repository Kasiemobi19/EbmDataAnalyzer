Comparison of polyethylene glycol 3350 and lactulose for treatment of chronic constipation in children.
Abstract Text 
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and lactulose were compared in an unblinded, randomized, crossover design for treatment of constipation in 37 children aged 2 to 16 years.
Subjects received lactulose (1.3 g/kg/d divided twice daily up to 20 g) or PEG 3350 (10 g/m2/day) for 2 weeks.
PEG 3350 significantly decreased the total colonic transit time compared to lactulose (47.6+/-2.7 vs 55.3+/-2.4
hours, mean +/- SE, PEG 3350 vs lactulose, respectively, p = 0.038).
The stool frequency, form, and the ease of passage were similar for each laxative.
Polyethylene glycol 3350 is an effective laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation in children.
