Abstract Text 
To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptoms, signs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein for acute maxillary sinusitis.Prospective cohort study.Danish general practice in cooperation with the otorhinolaryngology and neuroradiology department at Aalborg County Hospital.174
patients aged 18-65 years who were suspected by the general practitioner of having acute maxillary sinusitis.The independent association of symptoms, signs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and concentration of C reactive protein in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis defined as purulent or mucopurulent antral aspirate.Only raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.01) and raised C reactive protein (P = 0.007) were found to be independently associated with a diagnosis of acute maxillary sinusitis.
The combination of the two variables had a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.57.Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein are useful diagnostic criteria for acute maxillary sinusitis.
