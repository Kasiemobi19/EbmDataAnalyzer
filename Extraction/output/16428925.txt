The treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
Abstract Text 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, autoimmune, seronegative inflammatory arthritis characterized by varying degrees of axial and peripheral arthritis.
Here, we review the literature on the pharmacological management of PsA and present a simple treatment algorithm based on the available information.
Although PsA management must be individualized to the degree and type of joint pain and inflammation, in general, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) still represent first-line treatment of mild PsA.
Second-line therapy includes older agents such as gold salts, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and cyclosporine.
The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists represent the most recent major advance in the clinical management of PsA.
