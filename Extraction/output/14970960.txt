Trial of amitriptyline for relief of pain in amputees: results of a randomized controlled study.
Abstract Text 
To evaluate whether amitriptyline is more effective than placebo in improving phantom limb pain or residual limb pain.
Randomized controlled trial of amitriptyline for 6 weeks.
University hospital.
Thirty-nine persons with amputation-related pain lasting more than 6 months.
Six-week trial of amitriptyline (titrated up to 125 mg/d) or an active placebo (benztropine mesylate).
Analyses were conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary outcomes (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures (disability, satisfaction with life, handicap).
No significant differences were found between the treatment groups in outcome variables when controlling for initial pain scores.
Our findings do not support the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of postamputation pain.
