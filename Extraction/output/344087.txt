Randomized controlled trial of Syn-Ergel and an active placebo in the treatment of heartburn of pregnancy.
Abstract Text 
A randomized controlled trial was performed to study the efficacy of Syn-Ergel with an active placebo in the treatment of heartburn of pregnancy in ninety-two patients completing 7 days of therapy.
Syn-Ergel was significantly better (p less than 0.001) in all groups of pre-treatment pain severity in relieving the symptoms, and had a longer duration of action, than the active placebo.
Complete relief of pain was achieved in 79.5% of Syn-Ergel treatments with a further 10% of treatments resulting in marked easing of discomfort at 1 hour following administration.
The corresponding figures for the 'active placebo' were 56% and 20%.
The combination of an antacid and a protective mucosal coating agent would appear to be a useful approach in the treatment of heartburn of pregnacy.
