A comparative trial of Clinitar versus hydrocortisone cream in the treatment of atopic eczema.
Abstract Text 
Thirty patients with mild to moderate bilateral atopic eczema were treated on one side of the body with a new purified coal tar cream (Clinitar) and on the other side with 1% hydrocortisone cream, for 4 weeks.
The degree of infiltration of the skin erythema, lichenification, excoriations and dryness were assessed.
Both treatments were equally effective in reducing symptoms and there was also no difference in patient preference and cosmetic acceptability.
