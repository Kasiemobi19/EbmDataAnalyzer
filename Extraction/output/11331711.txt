Article Title 
American Academy of Pediatrics: The use and misuse of fruit juice in pediatrics.
Abstract Text 
Historically, fruit juice was recommended by pediatricians as a source of vitamin C and an extra source of water for healthy infants and young children as their diets expanded to include solid foods with higher renal solute.
Fruit juice is marketed as a healthy, natural source of vitamins and, in some instances, calcium.
Because juice tastes good, children readily accept it.
Although juice consumption has some benefits, it also has potential detrimental effects.
Pediatricians need to be knowledgeable about juice to inform parents and patients on its appropriate uses.
