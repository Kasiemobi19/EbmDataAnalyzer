Herpes simplex virus detection from genital lesions: a comparative study using antigen detection (HerpChek) and culture.
Abstract Text 
The sensitivity of a rapid enzyme immunoassay test (HerpChek Direct Herpes Simplex Virus Antigen Test [DuPont Medical Products, Wilmington, Del.]) for the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens in patient specimens was compared with HSV culture.
HerpChek positivity for HSV occurred with 179 (65%) of 275 lesion specimens, whereas culture for HSV was positive for 145 (53%) lesions (P = 0.002).
HerpChek was twice as sensitive as culture for the detection of HSV in late-stage lesions and was equivalent to culture for the detection of HSV in early lesions.
We conclude that HerpChek provides greater sensitivity than culture for HSV detection in late-stage genital lesions.
