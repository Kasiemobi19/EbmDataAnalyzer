Lorazepam and diazepam in the treatment of benign paroxysmal vertigo.
Abstract Text 
Animal studies indicate that diazepam suppresses resting activity in the vestibular system.
Despite lack of clinical studies, diazepam and lorazepam have been used empirically for relief of vertigo.
However, drug use with benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) is controversial which led to this study to evaluate the value of diazepam and lorazepam for relief of BPV.
Twenty-five BPV patients were given diazepam, lorazepam, or a placebo over four weeks using a double-blind technique.
Each patient rated his dizziness after each week, and the patient's nystagmus was rated before and after treatment.
The result showed a gradual decline in symptoms in all treatment groups with no additional relief with the drugs.
The latter was attributed to the fact that BPV represents a dynamic state whereas diazepam provides symptom relief due to action on the system in its static state.
