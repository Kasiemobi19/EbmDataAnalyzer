The varicella vaccine. Clinical trials in immunocompromised individuals.
Abstract Text 
A review of the use of live attenuated varicella vaccine in immunocompromised children, particularly those with underlying leukemia in remission, is presented.
Data concerning safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of this vaccine in high-risk children are reviewed.
The unique contributions toward our understanding of varicella vaccine, including spread of vaccine-type virus, incidence of zoster, and immune correlates provided by studies of immunocompromised patients are discussed.
The importance of protecting high-risk children against severe varicella by the use of varicella vaccine is apparent.
