Does dietary elimination in infancy prevent or only postpone a food allergy? A study of fish and citrus allergy in 375 children.
Abstract Text 
In a study of fish and citrus allergy these foods were strictly avoided in 177 children up to 1 year of age, whereas 152 children had started taking fish before age 6 months and 145 children had started taking citrus fruits beofre 3 months.
Both fish and citrus allergy, defined by a positive challenge, were found at age 3 years in a similar frequency (about 3%) in children with and without the first-year elimination.
The results suggest that food allergy in childhood can be postponed but not prevented by dietary elimination in infancy.
