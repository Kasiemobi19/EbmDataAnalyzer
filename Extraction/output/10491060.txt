Clinical benefits of lightweight compression: reduction of venous-related symptoms by ready-to-wear lightweight gradient compression hosiery.
Abstract Text 
Medical-grade compression of class I (20-30 mmHg) and class II (30-40 mmHg) have been shown to be beneficial against venous hypertension or congestion.
Relatively few studies address the effects of ready-to-wear (RTW) lightweight gradient compression pantyhose on venous symptoms.
To perform a study comparing the effects of two different compression RTW lightweight gradient compression stockings (8-15 mmHg and 15-20 mmHg) on the venous symptoms of flight attendants.
A prospective crossover trial of symptom evaluation in 19 flight attendants was performed in which participants rated their symptoms on a visual analog scale.
During the initial phase, participants wore no compression for 2 weeks.
They then wore 8-15 mmHg and 15-20 mmHg gradient compression support hose while flying over a 4-week period.
Symptoms before and after wearing the gradient compression stockings were compared and statistically analyzed.
Wearing of 8-15 mmHg gradient hose resulted in statistically significant improvement of discomfort (P < 0.01).
Swelling, fatigue, aching, and tightness of the leg were all improved to a statistically significant degree (P < 0.01).
For 15-20 mmHg gradient hosiery, symptoms were improved to a statistically significant or almost significant level.
The difference between the 8-15 mmHg and 15-20 mmHg compression was not statistically significant.
Use of lightweight (low compression) RTW gradient compression hosiery is very effective in improving symptoms of discomfort (P < 0.01), swelling (almost P < 0. 05), fatigue (P < 0.05), aching (P < 0.01), as well as leg tightness.
Improvement of symptoms is statistically significant compared to no compression when hosiery was worn regularly during waking hours for 4 weeks.
