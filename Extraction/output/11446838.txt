Selective urological evaluation in men with febrile urinary tract infection.
Abstract Text 
To investigate the prevalence and clinical importance of urological abnormalities in men with community-acquired febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).
In this prospective study, 85 men (median age 63 years, range 18--86) were followed for 1 year after an episode of febrile UTI.
They were investigated by excretory urography, cysto-urethroscopy, uroflowmetry, digital rectal examination and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume by abdominal ultrasonography.
The radiological examination of the upper urinary tract in 83 patients revealed 22 abnormal findings in 19 men.
Relevant clinical abnormalities leading to surgical intervention were found in only one patient who had renal calyceal stones.
The lower urinary tract investigation disclosed 46 findings in 35 men.
In all, surgically correctable disorders were found in 20 patients, of whom 15 had previously unrecognized abnormalities.
All patients who required surgery were identified either by a history of voiding difficulties, acute urinary retention at the time of infection, the presence of microscopic haematuria at follow-up after one month, or early recurrent symptomatic UTI.
Routine imaging studies of the upper urinary tract seem dispensable in men with febrile UTI.
To reveal abnormalities of clinical importance, any urological evaluation should primarily be focused on the lower urinary tract.
