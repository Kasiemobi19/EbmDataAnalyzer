National survey beverage consumption data for children and adolescents indicate the need to encourage a shift toward more nutritive beverages.
Abstract Text 
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently issued recommendations for 100% fruit juice consumption for children and adolescents.
National survey data (1994-1996, 1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals) were used to evaluate intake of 100% fruit juice for comparison with AAP recommendations.
Mean daily intakes of 100% fruit juice were 0.9, 4.6, and 3.4 ounces in children aged <6 months, 6 months-6 years, and 7-18 years, respectively, which fall within AAP recommendations for these age groups.
At age 5, mean intake of fruit drinks and ades exceeded that of 100% fruit juice (P=.009).
Carbonated soft drink intake exceeded that of 100% fruit juice at age 5 and of milk at age 13 (P<.04).
By age 13, adolescents drank more carbonated soft drinks than 100% fruit juice, milk, or fruit drinks and ades.
Increased consumption of nutrient-dense beverages (100% fruit juice, milk) and water as part of a varied diet should be encouraged.
