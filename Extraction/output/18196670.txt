Dental considerations for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus.
Abstract Text 
Dentists play a major role as part of an allied health team in providing oral care to patients with diabetes.
As such, they may detect undiagnosed cases of diabetes and refer patients to physicians for further evaluation.
The author describes new concepts in metabolic control for diabetes and the relationship of oral complications to diabetes mellitus.
The treatment of acute oral infections and the dentist's role in supporting patients in smoking-cessation programs are approaches that may reduce morbidity from diabetes mellitus.
In consultation with the patient's physician, the dentist may need to modify the treatment plan where systemic complications are present.
Working with the physician, nutritionist and dental hygienist, the dentist can maintain the patient's oral health and possibly improve the patient's metabolic control of diabetes.
In consultation with the patient's physician, the dentist can discuss the indications and contraindications of medications for the treatment of oral complications in patients with systemic complications resulting from diabetes.
Using a glucometer may avert emergencies related to diabetes.
The dental team can improve the metabolic control of a patient's diabetes by maintaining optimal oral health.
The dentist also can reduce comorbidity factors by supporting patients in tobacco-use cessation programs.
Dentists can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes by maintaining their patients' oral health and by referring patients with signs and symptoms of oral complications suggestive of diabetes to physicians for further evaluation.
