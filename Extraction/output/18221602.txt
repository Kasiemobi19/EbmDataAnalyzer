Diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea in heart disease.
Abstract Text 
One of the most common yet unidentified conditions in heart disease is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).
Although it is most prevalent in patients with heart failure, it has been epidemiologically and pathophysiologically linked to ischemic heart disease, hypertension, sudden cardiac death, atrial fibrillation, and stroke.
There are two primary SDB syndromes: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA; also known as Cheyne-Stokes respiration).
The pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie these disorders appear to be distinct but both involve recurrent cycles of excessive sympathetic activation, hypoxemias and hypercapnias, and increases in ventricular wall stress.
Signs and symptoms may include daytime somnolence, snoring, difficult-to-control hypertension, and refractory arrhythmias or angina.
In heart failure, half of patients will have SDB and most patients will exhibit evidence of both OSA and CSA, although one or the other may predominate.
The current standard diagnostic method is overnight laboratory polysomnography.
Primary therapies for OSA include lifestyle changes, various facial and oral appliances, head and neck surgery, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
CPAP is the most effective form of therapy for OSA, with few side effects, but is limited by compliance because of comfort-related issues.
In patients with cardiovascular disease who predominantly suffer from OSA, treatment recommendations should be based on current guidelines for OSA.
For patients with heart failure with predominant CSA, the current cornerstone of therapy is the optimization of medical therapy and resynchronization therapy when indicated.
When SDB persists despite optimal medical management, referral to a sleep medicine consultant should be considered.
