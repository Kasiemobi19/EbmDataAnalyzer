The effects of oral ibopamine in patients with mild heart failure--a double blind placebo controlled comparison to furosemide. The Ibopamine Study Group.
Abstract Text 
The effect of ibopamine and furosemide in 130 patients with NYHA Class I and II heart failure were studied in a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial.
Ibopamine 200 mg b.i.d. was compared to furosemide 40 mg q.d. and placebo.
A 1- to 2-week single-blind run-in period was followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period.
Reproducible treadmill exercise test times with the modified Naughton-Balke protocol were required for randomization.
Exercise times increased significantly in comparison to the placebo group after 8 weeks of therapy for both the furosemide group (1.2 min, P < 0.035) and the ibopamine group (1.3 min, P < 0.025).
Neither furosemide nor ibopamine affected quality of life assessments.
Adverse clinical experiences were generally mild and similar in frequency amongst the three treatment groups.
The results of this study show the usefulness of both ibopamine and furosemide as monotherapy in patients with mild congestive heart failure.
