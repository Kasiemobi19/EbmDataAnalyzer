Evaluation of six commercially available kits using purified heterophile antigen for the rapid diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis compared with Epstein-Barr virus-specific serology.
Abstract Text 
Novel commercial kits based on antibody reactivity to purified heterophile antigens have recently been introduced for the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr (EB) virus-associated infectious mononucleosis (IM).
It is important to determine possible improvements in the performance and reliability of such tests for the diagnosis of IM.
To evaluate the reliability of six commercially available kits for the rapid diagnosis of IM in comparison to EB-virus-specific serology.
In total, 100 sera, 53 from patients with serologically verified primary EB virus infection and 47 from EB-virus-immune or -susceptible patients, were used to evaluate the six rapid test kits: Monolatex, Mono-Latex, Mono-Lex (latex agglutination-based kits), Mono-Plus, IM-Check and Clearview IM (solid-phase-based kits).
EB-virus-specific serologies including detection of viral capsid antigen IgM and IgG and EB nuclear antigen-1 IgG, were used as reference methods.
Compared with the reference methods, the sensitivities and specificities of the heterophile antibody test kits were 70-92% and 96-100%, respectively.
IM-Check had a low sensitivity and was difficult to read.
The remaining kits performed well.
Monolatex, Mono-Latex, Mono-Lex, Mono-Plus and Clearview IM can be recommended for the confirmation of EB-virus-associated infectious mononucleosis.
Clearview IM combined a high sensitivity and specificity with very simple one-step solid-phase-based procedure.
