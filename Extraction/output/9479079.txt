Carbon dioxide laser-treatment of resistant verrucae vulgaris: retrospective analysis.
Abstract Text 
Verrucae are a very common dermatological problem that can be both painful and bothersome to the individual as well as costly to the health care system.
In some cases verrucae can be notoriously resistant to therapy.
To determine the cure rate, side effect profile, and overall satisfaction with CO2 laser treatment of recalcitrant verrucae vulgaris.
A retrospective survey was sent to over 200 patients who had resistant verrucae vulgaris treated with the carbon dioxide laser at The Toronto Hospital (Western Division) from 1989 to 1994.
Results: Ninety-two complete responses were received.
The overall cure rate was 64.1% at 12 months.
There was no significant difference in cure rates between single compared to multiple warts (p = .824
Fisher's exact test).
The duration of the wart being present showed no difference in cure rate (p = .801
Fisher's exact test).
The location of the wart also had no influence on the cure rate (p = .433
Fisher's exact test).
Overall, 71.7% of the patients were happy with the laser treatment and 85.7% would have it done again.
The carbon dioxide laser is an effective treatment of resistant verrucae vulgaris.
