Premature ejaculation and serotonergic antidepressants-induced delayed ejaculation: the involvement of the serotonergic system.
Abstract Text 
Premature ejaculation has generally been considered a psychosexual disorder with psychogenic aetiology.
Although still mainly treated by behavioural therapy, in recent years double-blind studies have indicated the beneficial effects of some of the serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) in delaying ejaculation.
We describe here the neurophysiology and the peripheral neuroanatomy of ejaculation and provide a review of the involvement of serotonin in the central nervous system in relation to serotonergic nuclei and their projections.
A hypothesis of the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors in premature ejaculation is postulated.
