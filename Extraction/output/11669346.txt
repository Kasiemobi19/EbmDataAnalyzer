Pediatric migraine prophylaxis with divalproex.
Abstract Text 
We followed 23 patients with pediatric migraine, ranging in age from 7 to 17 years, who were treated with preventive divalproex sodium for migraine prophylaxis.
Patients were evaluated for the presence or absence of comorbid psychiatric disorders or epilepsy to assess the possible differential effects of divalproex therapy.
Doses ranged from 3.1 to 32.9 mg/kg/day.
Seven patients had comorbid psychiatric disorders, whereas six patients had epilepsy (three rolandic, two generalized, and one indeterminate).
Fifteen patients had a greater than 50% reduction in migraine; six patients became headache free.
Divalproex doses used were not statistically different among the three groups.
A favorable response and headache freedom were more likely in patients with migraine alone or with comorbid epilepsy, and less likely in patients with psychiatric comorbidity.
Divalproex was well tolerated, and no significant side effects were reported.
No notable changes were noted in behavioral problems, and patients with epilepsy were well controlled.
In our cohort of patients, divalproex was most effective in patients with migraine alone or comorbid epilepsy.
