Satisfaction with onychomycosis treatment. Pulse versus continuous dosing.
Abstract Text 
The purpose of this study, which involved two dermatology clinics and two podiatric medical clinics, was to determine whether a difference exists in patient-reported satisfaction and compliance between continuous terbinafine therapy and pulse-dose itraconazole therapy for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.
Patients in this multicenter, open-label, cross-sectional study had previously completed treatment with either oral terbinafine or oral itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis.
Patients were interviewed by telephone to assess clinical outcomes, compliance, and satisfaction with treatment; clinical data were collected by medical chart review.
Patients reported significantly greater ease and convenience of treatment and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine therapy compared with pulse-dose itraconazole therapy.
