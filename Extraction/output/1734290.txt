Prevention of stroke with ticlopidine: who benefits most? TASS Baseline and Angiographic Data Subgroup.
Abstract Text 
We examined the baseline characteristics of patients in the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study (TASS) to determine if the effects of the two treatments in preventing stroke differed in various subgroups.
Patients with the following characteristics did less well on aspirin: elevated creatinine, hypertension or diabetes requiring treatment, or treatment with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs prior to their qualifying TIA or stroke.
Women and patients with vertebrobasilar symptoms did particularly well on ticlopidine.
We performed arteriography in 1,188 patients with carotid qualifying events.
The frequency of stroke in patients with abnormal arteriograms ipsilateral to their symptoms was slightly higher than in those with normal carotid arteries.
Ticlopidine was more effective in patients without carotid stenosis.
Ticlopidine is more effective than aspirin in preventing strokes in patients having warning TIAs.
The patients who benefit most from ticlopidine may be women, those who have vertebrobasilar symptoms, those with cerebral ischemic symptoms while on aspirin or anticoagulant therapy, and patients with diffuse atherosclerotic disease rather than high-grade carotid stenosis.
