Balloon angioplasty or stent placement in patients with azotemic renovascular disease: a retrospective comparison of clinical outcomes.
Abstract Text 
In this study comparing functional outcomes of renal angioplasty alone (PTRA) or angioplasty with stent placement in patients with renal artery stenosis (> or =60%) and renal insufficiency, 69 patients were treated with PTRA or stent placement.
After censoring, the PTRA group included 15 patients with a mean age of 75 years, mean serum creatinine (Cr) of 2.9 +/- 1.4 mg/dL, and mean follow-up of 10 months.
The stent placement group included 40 patients with a mean age of 71 years, mean Cr of 2.6 +/- 1.2 mg/dL, and mean follow-up of 12 months.
Stenting was performed primarily in four cases and after suboptimal angioplasty in the remainder.
Benefit was defined as either stabilization (+/-20%) or improvement in serum Cr levels.
Technical success was achieved in 16 of 17 (94%) PTRA patients and 55 of 58 (95%) patients receiving stents.
Complications included one surgically repaired axillary pseudoaneurysm, one distal stent positioning requiring a second stent, one stent protruding 5 mm into the aorta, two dissections requiring additional stents, one retroperitoneal hematoma, and one intrarenal atheroembolism treated with thrombolysis.
Three patients (mean initial Cr 3.9 mg/dL) required hemodialysis within 30 days of stenting.
One patient discontinued dialysis after stenting.
There were two procedure-related deaths.
An overall benefit was seen in 40% of patients after PTRA and 66% of patients after stent placement.
For the stent placement and PTRA groups, cumulative clinical benefit was 77% and 80%, respectively, at 3 months; 69% and 64%, respectively, at 6 months; 61% and 41%, respectively, at 12 months; and 48% and 14%, respectively, at 24 months.
A 50% loss of cumulative benefit was seen 34 months after stenting and 11.5 months after PTRA.
In the stent and PTRA groups, benefit was noted in 77% and 57%, respectively, of patients with an initial Cr of 2.3 or less, 53% and 25%, respectively, of patients with an initial Cr level higher than 2.3, and 44% and 17%, respectively, of patients with an initial Cr level of 3.0 mg/dL or more.
For patients with renal insufficiency, renal artery stenting provides superior clinical results compared with PTRA, mostly because late deterioration occurs after PTRA.
Outcomes are related to pretreatment serum Cr level.
