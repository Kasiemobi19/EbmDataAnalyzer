Conduct disorder: diagnosis and treatment in primary care.
Abstract Text 
Conduct disorder is a common childhood psychiatric problem that has an increased incidence in adolescence.
The primary diagnostic features of conduct disorder include aggression, theft, vandalism, violations of rules and/or lying.
For a diagnosis, these behaviors must occur for at least a six-month period.
Conduct disorder has a multifactorial etiology that includes biologic, psychosocial and familial factors.
The differential diagnosis of conduct disorder includes oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.
Family physicians may provide brief, behaviorally focused parent counseling, pharmacotherapy and referral for more intensive family and individual psychotherapy.
