Five-year follow-up of early lisuride and levodopa combination therapy versus levodopa monotherapy in de novo Parkinson's disease. The French Lisuride Study Group.
Abstract Text 
The value of an early initial coadministration of levodopa (L-dopa) and lisuride in Parkinson's disease was the main goal of the present study.
Eighty-two patients with recently diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson's disease were randomized into two groups for treatment with L-dopa alone or L-dopa + lisuride.
The trial was double-blinded for the first year and open for the following 4 years.
Selegiline (10 mg/day b.i.d.) was added in both groups at the end of the first year.
Outcome measures were evolution of L-dopa dosage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores and subscores, and incidence of motor complications.
The dropout rate was higher in the L-dopa group (63.4%) than in the combination group.
Motor improvement was better (p < 0.01) in the L-dopa + lisuride group.
Expected motor complications were rare, moderate and equivalent in the two groups despite a difference in L-dopa dosage (446.7 vs. 387.5 mg/day).
Long-term follow-up demonstrated the L-dopa-sparing effect of lisuride (average 1 mg/day), the beneficial effect of early combination therapy on motor status and the paucity of motor complications in both groups.
