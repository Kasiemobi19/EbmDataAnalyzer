Efficacy of high-titer live attenuated varicella vaccine in healthy young children.
Abstract Text 
The efficacy of a high-titer, reformulated varicella vaccine was studied in 513 10- to 30-month-old children.
Vaccinees were randomly allocated to 5 groups to receive one of two lots of an original high-titer vaccine, one of two lots of a partially heat-inactivated vaccine, or placebo.
Both vaccines were well tolerated.
Seroconversion was detected in 100% and 99% of children immunized with the high- and low-titer vaccines, respectively.
Sixty-five cases of serologically confirmed varicella-like disease were discovered during follow-up (mean, 29.3 months): 5 in the high-titer vaccine group, 19 in the low-titer vaccine group, and 41 in the placebo group (P < or = .005
for each difference).
Thus, the protective efficacy of live attenuated varicella vaccine is dependent on vaccine titer.
High-titer varicella vaccine induces excellent protection in healthy young children.
