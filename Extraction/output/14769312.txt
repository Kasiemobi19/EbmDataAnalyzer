A review of the literature on octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive.
Abstract Text 
Octylcyanoacrylate is a medical grade topical tissue adhesive that has been approved for closing surgical incisions and traumatic lacerations.
We reviewed animal and human studies that evaluated its use for a variety of surgical indications and specialties.
We also performed a meta-analysis of all clinical trials using octylcyanoacrylate.
Animal and human studies published in peer-reviewed articles as well as published abstracts.
A search of Medline was performed using the MESH terms: tissue adhesives, cyanoacrylates, and octylcyanoacrylate.
The current review and metanalysis demonstrate that octylcyanoacrylate can be used successfully in a wide variety of clinical and surgical settings for multiple types of wounds covering most of the surface of the human body.
Prior knowledge of the limitations and technical aspects specific to wound closure with octylcyanoacrylate as well as appropriate wound selection and preparation will help ensure optimal results.
