Pertussis in Missouri: evaluation of nasopharyngeal culture, direct fluorescent antibody testing, and clinical case definitions in the diagnosis of pertussis.
Abstract Text 
No diagnostic test for pertussis in routine use in the United States has both high sensitivity and high specificity.
During a statewide increase in the incidence of pertussis in Missouri, we studied the clinical features of 153 patients with suspected pertussis in the Greater St. Louis area from whom a specimen for pertussis culture had been taken between 15 May and 19 September 1989.
In this cross-sectional study, nasopharyngeal cultures were more likely to be positive for persons whose specimens were collected < 21 days after cough onset (adjusted rate ratio [RRa] and 95% confidence interval = 3.4; 1.5-8.0)
and who were not receiving erythromycin/sulfamethoxazole prior to the culture [RRa = 5.8; 0.8-40.6],
who had received fewer than three prior doses of pertussis vaccine [RRa = 1.8; 0.8-4.2],
and whose specimen was in transit to the laboratory for < 4 days [RRa = 2.0; 0.8-5.5].
Among children < 5 years of age, spasmodic cough plus a lymphocytosis of > 10,000/mm3 was the acute symptom complex associated with the highest predictive value for a positive culture result (67%).
Cough for > or = 14 days plus whoop was sensitive (81%) and specific (58%) for identifying children with culture-confirmed pertussis.
Direct fluorescent antibody staining performed well as a screening test for pertussis but requires substantial commitment of personnel and resources.
In the absence of a positive culture result, clinical case definitions should be used for decision making (e.g., initiation of antimicrobial therapy and routine case reporting).
