Fractures and anatomical variations of the proximal portion of the fifth metatarsal.
Abstract Text 
Fractures of the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal are frequent and with conservative treatment uniformly heal well.
In contrast, fractures of the metatarsal shaft distal to the tuberosity heal slowly.
Of 100 fractures of the tuberosity, almost all were clinically united within three weeks and roentgenographically united within two months.
Of twenty fractures in the proximal part of the shaft, five required bone grafts and the time elapsed before roentgenographic and clinical evidence of union was variable and often prolonged.
