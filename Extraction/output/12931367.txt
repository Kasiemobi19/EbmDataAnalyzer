And the difference of IIEF-5 before and after the treatment were compared.
Twenty-seven patients had their PE improved and the effective rate was 60%.
Forty patients reported the improvement in erection and the percentage of erectile improvement was 88.88%.
All the 27 patients with improvement of PE achieved effective erection through the administration of 50 mg sildenafil and the satisfaction rate reached 81.48%.
On the other hand, only 1 case (5.56%) reported satisfaction over the treatment in the 18 patients who did not obtain improvement of PE. Between the PE improvement group and non-improvement group, there were significant differences (P < 0.001) shown in IIEF-5 scores before and after the treatment.
Mild or moderate side effects were reported in 9 patients(20%), who recovered without any treatment.
