Tibial tuberosity excision for symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter disease.
Abstract Text 
A modified Ferciot procedure was used to excise the tibial tubercle in patients with persistently symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter disease.
Forty-two knees in 35 patients were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 5 years to assess outcome.
The results revealed relief of pain in 95% of patients and reduction of prominence in 85.5% with minimal complication, in particular no evidence of genu recurvatum.
The pathogenesis of the condition is outlined, and some of the theories and treatment modalities discussed.
Tibial tubercle excision is recommended as the treatment of choice in those few cases that fail with conservative treatment.
