Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia.
Abstract Text 
Suspected macrosomic fetuses are usually induced in order to reduce the risk of difficult operative delivery.
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of a policy of labour induction for suspected fetal macrosomia on method of delivery and maternal or perinatal morbidity.
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register.
Randomised trials of induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia in non-diabetic women.
Trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers.
Study authors were contacted for additional information.
Two trials involving 313 women were included.
Compared to expectant management, induction of labour for suspected macrosomia did not reduce the risk of caesarean section (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.46) or instrumental delivery (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.98).
Perinatal morbidity was similar between groups.
Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia in non-diabetic women did not appear to alter the risk of maternal or neonatal morbidity.
