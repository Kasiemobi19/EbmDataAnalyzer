Verrucae treated by levamisole.
Abstract Text 
To assess the role of levamisole in treatment of different types of warts, a double-blind study was conducted on 40 patients with different types of warts.
Patients were divided into two equal groups, A and B. Group A received levamisole 5 mg/kg body weight on 3 consecutive days every 2 weeks for a period up to 5 months, while patients of group B received placebo for the same period.
In group A, 12 patients showed complete cure (60%), two showed partial cure (10%), and the remaining six patients showed no response (30%).
In group B, complete cure was achieved only in one case.
The higher cure rate was observed in plane and common warts, while plantar warts showed no improvement with levamisole treatment.
