The adult neck mass.
Abstract Text 
Family physicians frequently encounter neck masses in adult patients.
A careful medical history should be obtained, and a thorough physical examination should be performed.
The patient's age and the location, size, and duration of the mass are important pieces of information.
Inflammatory and infectious causes of neck masses, such as cervical adenitis and cat-scratch disease, are common in young adults.
Congenital masses, such as branchial anomalies and thyroglossal duct cysts, must be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Neoplasms (benign and malignant) are more likely to be present in older adults.
Fine-needle aspiration and biopsy and contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning are the best techniques for evaluating these masses.
An otolaryngology consultation for endoscopy and possible excisional biopsy should be obtained when a neck mass persists beyond four to six weeks after a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
