Winter seasonality and rotavirus diarrhoea in adults.
Abstract Text 
We investigated the aetiological role of group A rotavirus in adults with acute diarrhoea in a 4-year prospective study.
Of 683 patients with acute diarrhoea, 97 (14%) shed rotavirus as a sole agent, whereas six (5%) of 115 patients without diarrhoea shed rotavirus.
Half of patients with rotavirus diarrhoea required admission to hospital.
Unlike rotavirus diarrhoea in children, the occurrence of rotavirus-positive cases did not show a significant winter seasonality.
Rotavirus infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of diarrhoeal diseases in adults.
