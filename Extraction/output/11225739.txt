The efficacy, safety, and practicality of treatments for adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Abstract Text 
Studies examining interventions for adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were reviewed to evaluate their efficacy.
These efficacy findings were supplemented with a preliminary system for judging safety and practicality.
Results suggest that the stimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH) is safe and well-established empirically, but has some problems with inconvenience and noncompliance.
Preliminary research supports the efficacy, safety, and practicality of some psychotherapeutic interventions, including behavioral classroom interventions, note-taking training, and family therapy.
Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants was judged to have minimal empirical support and debatable safety.
Very little is known about long-term effectiveness of treatments, long-term compliance, or multimodal treatments for adolescents such as stimulants plus behavior therapy.
