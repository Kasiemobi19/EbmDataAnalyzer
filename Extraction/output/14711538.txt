Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome.
Abstract Text 
Since the 1990 National Institutes of Health-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria.
The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology.
PCOS remains a syndrome, and as such no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis.
Its clinical manifestations may include menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity.
Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS.
PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.
