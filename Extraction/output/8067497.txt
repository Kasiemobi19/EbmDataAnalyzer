Paroxetine treatment of premature ejaculation: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
Abstract Text 
Seventeen male outpatients with premature ejaculation were randomly assigned to treatment with paroxetine (N = 8) or placebo (N = 9).
After a first week dose of 20 mg/day, the paroxetine regimen was increased to 40 mg/day for 5 weeks.
Patients and their female partners were interviewed separately.
Patients treated with paroxetine had significantly greater clinical improvement than the patients given placebo.
