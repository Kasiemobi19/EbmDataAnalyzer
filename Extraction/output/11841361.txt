U.K. guidelines for the management of cutaneous melanoma.
Abstract Text 
These guidelines for management of cutaneous melanoma present evidence-based guidance for treatment, with identification of the strength of evidence available at the time of preparation of the guidelines, and a brief overview of epidemiological aspects, diagnosis and investigation.
To reflect the collaborative process for the U.K., they are subject to dual publication in the British Journal of Dermatology and the British Journal of Plastic Surgery.
