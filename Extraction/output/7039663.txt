A randomized controlled trial of complete bed rest versus ambulation in the management of proteinuric hypertension during pregnancy.
Abstract Text 
Forty patients participated in a randomized controlled trial of complete bed rest versus ambulation as desired in the management of proteinuric hypertension during pregnancy.
Daily increases in serum human placental lactogen and oestriol concentrations were greater in the rested group.
An especially 'at risk' group of 10 patients with both hyperuricaemia and severe fetal growth retardation was identified.
Strict confinement to bed in these cases seemed to encourage the development of the premonitory symptoms of eclampsia, but was associated with a better prognosis for the fetus.
