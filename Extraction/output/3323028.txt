Cryotherapy compared with trichloroacetic acid in treating genital warts.
Abstract Text 
In an observer blind comparative study, 130 men with penile warts were randomly allocated to treatment with either cryotherapy or trichloroacetic acid (TCAA).
There was no significant difference in response to treatment, side effects, or recurrence rates between the two treatments.
Warts resolved in 81% of patients treated with TCAA compared with 88% of those treated with cryotherapy.
Early recurrence occurred in 36% of patients treated with TCAA and in 39% of those treated with cryotherapy.
