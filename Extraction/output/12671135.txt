Apnea, sudden infant death syndrome, and home monitoring.
Abstract Text 
More than 25 years have elapsed since continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring at home was suggested to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
In the ensuing interval, multiple studies have been unable to establish the alleged efficacy of its use.
In this statement, the most recent research information concerning extreme limits for a prolonged course of apnea of prematurity is reviewed.
Recommendations regarding the appropriate use of home cardiorespiratory monitoring after hospital discharge emphasize limiting use to specific clinical indications for a predetermined period, using only monitors equipped with an event recorder, and counseling parents that monitor use does not prevent sudden, unexpected death in all circumstances.
The continued implementation of proven SIDS prevention measures is encouraged.
