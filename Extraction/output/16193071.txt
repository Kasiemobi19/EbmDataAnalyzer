Male hypogonadism. Part I: Epidemiology of hypogonadism.
Abstract Text 
Male hypogonadism is a frequent and potentially undertreated condition.
A number of longitudinal epidemiologic studies, including the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the New Mexico Aging Process Study, and the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, have demonstrated age-related increases in the likelihood of developing hypogonadism.
In addition to advancing age, increasing body mass index and/or type II diabetes mellitus may be associated with lower circulating androgen levels.
Owing to the demographic trends toward increasing population age and life expectancy, together with the emerging pandemic of diabetes and recent trend toward an increasing prevalence of obesity in the United States, clinicians are likely to encounter increasing cases of hypogonadism in the near future.
