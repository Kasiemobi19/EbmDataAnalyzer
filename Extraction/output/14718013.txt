Combined diagnostic approach of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy in the evaluation of female infertility: results of 612 patients.
Abstract Text 
To clarify the role of a combined diagnostic approach using laparoscopy and hysteroscopy in the evaluation of female infertility in developing countries.
In a prospective study, 612 consecutive infertile women underwent complete fertility evaluation at a tertiary university infertility clinic: 300 complained of primary infertility, 221 of secondary infertility, and 91 were requesting reversal of a previous tubal ligation.
All the patients were examined by simultaneous combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy as a part of their routine infertility evaluation.
Focused hysteroscopic evaluation of the region of utero-tubal junction was attempted.
Laparoscopy was successful in 608 and hysteroscopy in 597 patients.
The most frequent pathologies detected hysteroscopically in the infertile group were adhesive in nature and believed to be post-traumatic and/or post-phlogistic.
The number of intrauterine abnormalities found by hysteroscopy was significantly greater than by hysterosalpingography.
The rate of diagnosis of significant lesions by laparoscopy of 64.3% rose to 76.6% when the hysteroscopic findings were included.
A significant number of women with secondary infertility had abnormal hysteroscopic findings when compared to either women with primary infertility or those requesting sterilization reversal.
Hysteroscopic evaluation of the region of utero-tubal junction revealed significant lesions believed to have caused infertility in comparison with those requesting sterilization reversal.
The combined diagnostic approach of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy is recommended in the evaluation of female infertility in communities where the risk of pelvic infections is great.
