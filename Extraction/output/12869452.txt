Effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on risk of Alzheimer's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.
Abstract Text 
To quantify the risk of Alzheimer's disease in users of all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and users of aspirin and to determine any influence of duration of use.
Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published between 1966 and October 2002 that examined the role of NSAID use in preventing Alzheimer's disease.
Studies identified through Medline, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and the Cochrane Library.
Nine studies looked at all NSAIDs in adults aged > 55 years.
Six were cohort studies (total of 13 211 participants), and three were case-control studies (1443 participants).
The pooled relative risk of Alzheimer's disease among users of NSAIDs was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.94).
The risk was 0.95 (0.70 to 1.29) among short term users (< 1 month) and 0.83 (0.65 to 1.06) and 0.27 (0.13 to 0.58) among intermediate term (mostly < 24 months) and long term (mostly > 24 months) users, respectively.
The pooled relative risk in the eight studies of aspirin users was 0.87 (0.70 to 1.07).
NSAIDs offer some protection against the development of Alzheimer's disease.
The appropriate dosage and duration of drug use and the ratios of risk to benefit are still unclear.
