Article Title 
A randomized controlled trial of early amniotomy.
Abstract Text 
OBJECTIVE-To determine if a policy of early amniotomy resulted in a reduction in mean labour duration when compared to a policy of conservation of the membranes.
DESIGN-A single-centre randomized controlled trial.
SETTING-A tertiary care teaching hospital in Alberta, Canada.
SUBJECTS-Ninety-seven term nulliparae in spontaneous labour, baby in cephalic presentation.
INTERVENTION-Early amniotomy versus intent to keep membranes intact.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES-Interval from randomization to delivery, rate of abnormalities of fetal heart rate tracings, cord artery blood pH, Apgar scores.
RESULTS-The mean interval from randomization to delivery was 390.9 (SE 29.1) min in the amniotomy group and 442.9 (SE 34.1) min in the control group (P = 0.251).
There were no differences between groups in the occurrence of fetal heart rate tracing abnormalities, nor was there a difference in the proportion of babies with abnormal Apgar scores, or abnormal cord pH (less than 7.20).
CONCLUSION-The results of the study fail to support the long held belief that early amniotomy is an effective method for reducing labour duration.
