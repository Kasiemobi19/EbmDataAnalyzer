Definition of an algorithm for the management of common skin diseases at primary health care level in sub-Saharan Africa.
Abstract Text 
In order to help primary health care (PHC) workers in developing countries in the care of common skin diseases, an algorithm for the management of pyoderma, scabies, superficial mycoses, contact dermatitis and referral of early leprosy cases (based on the identification of diseases through the presence of objective key signs, and on treatments by generic drugs) was elaborated.
One thousand patients were seen by trained dermatologists, who established diagnoses and treatments; in addition, there was systematic recording of each key sign, according to the successive algorithm steps.
We compared the diagnostics and treatments obtained for several combinations of diagnostic signs, with those of the dermatologists.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of defined combinations were high for pyoderma, scabies and superficial mycoses.
Values were less exact for dermatitis and leprosy, but were considered sufficient for the level of health care targeted.
The apportionment of treatments between the algorithm and the dermatological approaches was considered appropriate in more than 80% of cases; mismanagement was possible in 7% of cases, with few predictable harmful consequences.
The algorithm was found satisfactory for the management of the dermatological priorities according to the standards required at the PHC level.
