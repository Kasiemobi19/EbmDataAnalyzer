Treatment of pyogenic granuloma with a sclerosing agent.
Abstract Text 
Pyogenic granulomas have been treated by cryosurgery, curettage, electrodesiccation, chemical cauterization, and laser surgery.
The therapeutic effects of these conservative treatments are limited, however.
In this study, the efficacy of a sclerosing agent (monoethanolamine oleate) was evaluated for the treatment of pyogenic granuloma.
Pyogenic granuloma was treated by local injection of the monoethanolamine oleate solution in nine patients who were from 1 to 57 years of age (median 18 years).
The treatment effect was determined by physical examination.
All lesions were removed completely with no recurrence, and scars were inconspicuous in all cases.
Complications occurred in only one patient who complained of pain due to an avoidable injection of excess solution.
Sclerotherapy with monoethanolamine oleate is effective in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma and offers an alternative to conventional methods in cases for which conservative treatment is preferable.
