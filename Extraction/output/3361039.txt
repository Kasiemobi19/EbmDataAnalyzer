Gynecologic-obstetric changes after loss of massive excess weight following bariatric surgery.
Abstract Text 
A clinical study was undertaken to assess gynecologic-obstetric changes in morbidly obese women who lost greater than or equal to 50% of their excess weight with bariatric surgery.
The 138 females (109 of reproductive age), age 35 +/- 9 SD yr, weighed 124 +/- 23 kg before surgery and 79 +/- 13 kg after weight loss had stabilized.
Menstrual irregularities were present in 40.4% of premenopausal patients preoperatively; after massive weight loss, cycles were abnormal in 4.6% (p less than 0.001).
Infertility problems were present preoperatively in 29.3%
Of these, nine tried to conceive after weight loss and were successful.
During past pregnancies, medical complications were frequent (hypertension 26.7%, pre-eclampsia 12.8%, diabetes 7.0%, and deep vein thrombosis 7.0%).
After weight-loss stabilization, these obstetric complications did not occur.
Incidence of urinary stress incontinence decreased from 61.2% to 11.6% (p less than 0.001).
Gynecologic-obstetric changes tended to normalize after loss of massive body weight.
