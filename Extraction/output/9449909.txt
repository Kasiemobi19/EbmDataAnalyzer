Bacteriology of inflamed and uninflamed epidermal inclusion cysts.
Abstract Text 
To determine whether inflamed and uninflamed epidermoid cysts differ in the number and/or type of bacteria inhabiting them.
A controlled study.
We obtained aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture specimens from 25 inflamed and 25 uninflamed epidermoid cysts.
A university medical center.
Nonimmunocompromised adults without recent systemic use of antibiotics.
The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to number of bacterial isolates, "no growth" cultures, and aerobic, anaerobic, or potential pathogens cultured.
The microbiological milieu of inflamed epidermoid cysts is similar to that of uninflamed cysts.
Possible mechanisms for inflammation are discussed.
