Tegaserod for the treatment of chronic constipation: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational study.
Abstract Text 
Chronic constipation is a common, persistent disorder with limited effective treatment options.
This study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tegaserod in the treatment of chronic constipation.
After a 2-wk baseline period, patients were randomized to double-blind treatment of 12 wk with tegaserod (2 or 6 mg b.i.d.) or placebo.
Response during weeks 1-4 (primary variable) was defined as an increase in complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM)/wk.
Secondary variables included response during weeks 1-12, patient evaluation of individual symptoms, and global assessment of bowel habits and constipation.
One thousand two hundred and sixty-four patients were randomized to tegaserod or placebo.
Responder rates for the primary efficacy variable were 35.6% for tegaserod 2 mg b.i.d.
(p= 0.0059 vs placebo), 40.2% for 6 mg b.i.d.
(p < 0.0001 vs placebo) and 26.7% for placebo.
The number needed to treat was 7.3 for the 6 mg b.i.d.
dose compared with 11.1 for tegaserod 2 mg b.i.d.
Tegaserod 6 mg b.i.d.
reduced straining, abdominal bloating/distension, and abdominal pain/discomfort during the 12-wk treatment period compared with placebo (p < 0.05 for all symptoms).
Significant improvements were also seen in stool form and in global assessment of bowel habits and constipation.
The most common adverse events, headache and abdominal pain, were more frequent with placebo than with tegaserod.
Tegaserod was efficacious in relieving symptoms of chronic constipation and was well tolerated.
