Contraceptive efficacy and safety of DMPA-SC.
Abstract Text 
DMPA-SC 104 mg/0.65 mL is a new, low-dose subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Depo-Provera contraceptive injection (150 mg/mL medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension) that provides efficacy, safety and immediacy of onset equivalent to Depo-Provera intramuscular (IM) injection.
Two large, open-label, Phase 3 studies assessed the 1-year contraceptive efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction with DMPA-SC administered every 3 months (12-13 weeks).
Zero pregnancies were reported in both studies, which included a total of 16,023 woman-cycles of exposure to DMPA-SC and substantial numbers of overweight or obese women.
DMPA-SC was well-tolerated and adverse events were similar to those reported previously with Depo-Provera IM.
Thus, DMPA-SC offers women a new, highly effective and convenient long-acting contraceptive option.
