Three-day lansoprazole quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori-positive duodenal ulcers: a randomized controlled study.
Abstract Text 
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a 3-day quadruple therapy with a standard 7-day triple therapy in eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection and healing duodenal ulcers.
Patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcers were randomized to receive either lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days (LCM-7) or lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, metronidazole 400 mg, and bismuth subcitrate 240 mg twice daily for 3 days (LCMB-3).
No pre- or post-treatment acid suppression was used.
Follow-up endoscopy was performed at week 6.
A total of 118 patients were recruited.
Sixty patients in the LCM-7 group and 53 patients in the LCMB-3 group returned for endoscopy.
Intention-to-treat eradication rates were 87% and 86% (P=0.94) and per protocol eradication rates were 87% and 94% (P=0.29) in the LCM-7 and LCMB-3 groups, respectively.
Per protocol and intention-to-treat ulcer healing rates were 98% and 98% in LCM-7 and 100% and 91% in LCMB-3, respectively.
There were no significant differences in efficacy in relation to the initial metronidazole and clarithromycin susceptibility.
Significant reduction in the duration of side-effects was found in the LCMB-3 group.
The 3-day quadruple therapy is highly effective, better tolerated and can be considered as a first-line therapy in duodenal ulcer management.
