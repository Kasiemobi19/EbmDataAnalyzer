A practical approach to hypercalcemia.
Abstract Text 
Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians.
The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients.
Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems.
The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy.
Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.
An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued.
Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism.
It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria.
Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery.
Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency.
Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.
