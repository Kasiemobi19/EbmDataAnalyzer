Pregnancy outcomes of adolescents enrolled in a CenteringPregnancy program.
Abstract Text 
Adolescent pregnancy remains a significant social, economic, and health issue in the United States.
The unique developmental needs of the pregnant adolescent require attention when designing prenatal care services.
The CenteringPregnancy model of group prenatal care provides education and support for young women in an active and developmentally appropriate environment.
Thirteen groups of adolescents (N = 124) have completed the Centering program at the Teen Pregnancy Center at Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.
Evaluation data suggest that the model has encouraged excellent health care compliance, satisfaction with prenatal care, and low rates of preterm birth and low birth weight infants.
