Equivalence of indapamide SR and enalapril on microalbuminuria reduction in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes: the NESTOR Study.
Abstract Text 
To test whether microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension is primarily dependent on the severity of hypertension, and to compare the effectiveness of two antihypertensive drugs with opposite effects on the renin-angiotensin system [the diuretic, indapamide sustained release (SR), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril] in reducing microalbuminuria.
A multinational, multicentre, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, two-parallel-groups study over 1 year.
After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 570 patients (ages 60.0 +/- 9.9 years, 64% men) with type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140-180 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 110 mmHg], and persistent microalbuminuria (20-200 microg/min) were allocated randomly to groups to receive indapamide SR 1.5 mg (n = 284) or enalapril 10 mg (n = 286) once a day.
Amlodipine, atenolol, or both were added, if necessary, to achieve the target blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg.
There was a significant reduction in the urinary albumin : creatinine ratio.
Mean reductions were 35% [95% confidence interval (CI) 24 to 43] and 39% (95% CI 30 to 47%) in the indapamide SR and enalapril groups, respectively.
Equivalence was demonstrated between the two groups [1.08 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.31%); P = 0.01].
The reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 16.6 +/- 9.0 mmHg for the indapamide SR group and 15.0 +/- 9.1 mmHg for the enalapril group (NS); the reduction in SBP was significantly greater (P = 0.0245 ) with indapamide SR.
More than 50% of patients in each group required additional antihypertensive therapy, with no differences between groups.
Both treatments were well tolerated.
Indapamide-SR-based therapy is equivalent to enalapril-based therapy in reducing microalbuminuria with effective blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.
