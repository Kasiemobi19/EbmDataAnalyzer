The kinematic patterns of toe-walkers.
Abstract Text 
Children who toe-walk can pose a diagnostic problem.
The differential diagnosis includes mild spastic diplegia and idiopathic toe-walking.
Clinical differentiation between these two patient groups can be particularly difficult, and there are no objective diagnostic tests to assist the clinician.
We assessed 50 children who toe-walk to define the kinematic patterns of lower-limb joint motion in the sagittal plane.
There were 23 children with mild spastic diplegia.
22 idiopathic toe-walkers, and five normal children who were asked to toe-walk.
We found characteristic patterns of knee and ankle motion that differentiated spastic diplegia from idiopathic toe-walking.
Normal children asked to toe-walk had the same pattern as the idiopathic group.
Gait analysis is a diagnostic tool that enables the clinician objectively to differentiate mild spastic diplegia from idiopathic toe-walking.
