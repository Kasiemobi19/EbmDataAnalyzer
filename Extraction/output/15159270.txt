Efficacy of extended-release niacin with lovastatin for hypercholesterolemia: assessing all reasonable doses with innovative surface graph analysis.
Abstract Text 
Combination therapy to improve the total lipid profile may achieve greater coronary risk reductions than lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) alone.
A new extended-release niacin (niacin ER)/lovastatin tablet substantially lowers LDL-C, triglyceride, and lipoprotein(a) levels and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level.
We evaluated these serum lipid responses to niacin ER/lovastatin at all clinically reasonable doses.
Men (n = 85) and women (n = 79) with type IIa or IIb primary hyperlipidemia after diet were randomized among 5 parallel treatment arms.
Each arm had 5 sequential 4-week treatment periods: niacin ER (starting at 500 mg/d, increasing in 500-mg increments to 2500 mg/d); lovastatin (starting at 10 mg, increasing to 20 mg, then 40 mg/d); and 3 combinations arms, each with a constant lovastatin dose and escalating niacin ER doses.
For primary comparisons, mean LDL-C level reductions from baseline were greater with niacin ER/lovastatin (1500/20 mg) than with lovastatin (20 mg) (35% vs 22%, P<.001) and with niacin ER/lovastatin (2000/40 mg) than with lovastatin (40 mg) (46% vs 24%, P<.001).
Each 500-mg increase in niacin ER, on average, decreased LDL-C levels an additional 4% and increased HDL-C levels 8%.
The maximum recommended dose (2000/40 mg/d) increased HDL-C levels 29% and decreased LDL-C levels 46%, triglyceride levels 38%, and lipoprotein(a) levels 14%.
All lipid responses were dose dependent and generally additive.
Graphs of the dose-response relationships as 3-dimensional surfaces documented the strength and consistency of these responses.
Niacin ER/lovastatin combination therapy substantially improves 4 major lipoprotein levels associated with atherosclerotic disease.
Dose-response surfaces provide a practical guide for dose selection.
