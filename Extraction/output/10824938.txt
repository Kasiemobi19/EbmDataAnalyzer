The ultrasound investigation of scrotal swelling.
Abstract Text 
The objectives of this study were to: (1) establish the causes of scrotal swelling in the hospital catchment population; (2) define the role of high frequency ultrasound examination in the management of scrotal swelling.
A retrospective study of 582 patients who had high frequency ultrasound examination was carried out.
Those requiring more information on perfusion had colour doppler examination.
Forty-four per cent of examinations were performed for scrotal swelling.
The cause of the scrotal swelling was mainly extratesticular (75% of all scrotal swellings), hydrocele being the commonest.
Of the intratesticular causes, infection (50.8%) and tumour (20.6%) were the commonest.
In conclusion ultrasound examination distinguishes extratesticular (almost always benign) from intratesticular (potentially malignant) causes of scrotal swelling.
Infection, trauma and torsion mimic the ultrasound appearance of tumour as do rare benign entities.
