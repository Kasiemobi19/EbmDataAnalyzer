Does a high fibre diet prevent the complications of diverticular disease?
Abstract Text 
The management of diverticular disease has altered radically with the widespread use of high fibre diet (HFD) over the past decade.
However, whether this regimen has improved the prognosis in patients admitted with acute complications is still debatable.
In this study the outcome of 100 such patients admitted to hospital with acute episodes of diverticular disease has been reviewed.
Seventy-five per cent were treated conservatively with HFD and review after 5--7 years showed that over 90 per cent remained symptom-free, suggesting that HFD may afford protection by preventing further complications.
