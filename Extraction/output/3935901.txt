Correlates of sexual desire in post-menopausal women.
Abstract Text 
Sexual desire was studied in 22 post-menopausal women (absence of menses for at least 12 mth) without complaints of sexual dysfunction, not receiving estrogen replacement therapy, and in good physical health.
Psychosexual evaluation, medical history, physical and pelvic examinations, and blood samples for the determination of estradiol, androstenedione, FSH and LH were obtained.
In addition, the effects of a formal exercise program on sexual desire was investigated.
It was found that approximately 50% of the women in this study experienced no decline in sexual interests with menopause, and less than 20% reported a significant decrease.
Results indicated a positive relationship between desire and a measure of marital adjustments which women with loss of sex desire had on the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test.
There was no correlation between gonadotropins and loss of sexual desire.
