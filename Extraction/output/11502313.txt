Cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people from the Honolulu Heart Program: a cohort study.
Abstract Text 
A generally held belief is that cholesterol concentrations should be kept low to lessen the risk of cardiovascular disease.
However, studies of the relation between serum cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people have shown contrasting results.
To investigate these discrepancies, we did a longitudinal assessment of changes in both lipid and serum cholesterol concentrations over 20 years, and compared them with mortality.
Lipid and serum cholesterol concentrations were measured in 3572 Japanese/American men (aged 71-93 years) as part of the Honolulu Heart Program.
We compared changes in these concentrations over 20 years with all-cause mortality using three different Cox proportional hazards models.
Mean cholesterol fell significantly with increasing age.
Age-adjusted mortality rates were 68.3, 48.9, 41.1, and 43.3 for the first to fourth quartiles of cholesterol concentrations, respectively.
Relative risks for mortality were 0.72 (95% CI 0.60-0.87),
0.60 (0.49-0.74), and 0.65 (0.53-0.80), in the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively, with quartile 1 as reference.
A Cox proportional hazard model assessed changes in cholesterol concentrations between examinations three and four.
Only the group with low cholesterol concentration at both examinations had a significant association with mortality (risk ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.36).
We have been unable to explain our results.
These data cast doubt on the scientific justification for lowering cholesterol to very low concentrations (<4.65 mmol/L) in elderly people.
