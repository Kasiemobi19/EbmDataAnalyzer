Contraceptive efficacy and cycle control with the Ortho Evra/Evra transdermal system: the analysis of pooled data.
Abstract Text 
To present efficacy and cycle control data pooled from three pivotal studies of the contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra/Evra).
Three multicenter, open-label, contraceptive studies that included up to 13 treatment cycles.Setting: 183 centers.
3,319 women.Intervention(s): Three consecutive 7-day patches (21 days) with 1 patch-free week per cycle.
Contraceptive efficacy and cycle control.
Overall and method failure life-table estimates of contraceptive failure through 13 cycles were 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.3%)
and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%),
respectively.
Corresponding Pearl indices were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.44-1.33)
and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.31-1.10).
Contraceptive failure among women with a body weight < 90 kg (<198 lb) was low and uniformly distributed across the weight range.
A subgroup of women with body weight > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb) may have increased risk of pregnancy.
The incidence of breakthrough bleeding was low and decreased over time.
In contraceptive patch users, the overall annual probability of pregnancy was 0.8% and the method failure probability was 0.6%.
The efficacy of the patch was high and similar across age and racial groups.
Among women < 90 kg (<198 lb), contraceptive failure was low and uniformly distributed across the range of body weights.
In women > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb), contraceptive failures may be increased.
Efficacy and cycle control have been shown to be comparable to an established oral contraceptive.
