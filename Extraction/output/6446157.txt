Nonorganic physical signs in low-back pain.
Abstract Text 
Nonorganic physical signs in low-back pain are described and standardized in 350 North American and British patients.
These nonorganic signs are distinguishable from the standard clinical signs of physical pathology and correlate with other psychological data.
By helping to separate the physical from the nonorganic they clarify the assessment of purely physical pathologic conditions.
It is suggested also that the nonorganic signs can be used as a simple clinical screen to help identify patients who require more detailed psychological assessment.
