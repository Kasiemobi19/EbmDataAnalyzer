Allergic contact dermatitis: pathophysiology applied to future therapy.
Abstract Text 
Contact dermatitis is a common reason for patient visits to primary-care clinics and represents up to 7% of all dermatologic consultations in the US.
Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the pathophysiology of contact dermatitis, particularly the allergic form.
A better understanding of pathologic mechanisms has led to improved management of cases and will continue to advance treatment modalities.
The present paper reviews the pathogenesis and current treatment of allergic contact dermatitis and speculates on the prospects for improved future therapy.
